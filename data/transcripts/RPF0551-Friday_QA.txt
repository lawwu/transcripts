[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   This works kind of like talk radio where you call in and I answer the phone and we talk

[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   So today we begin with Greg in Pennsylvania.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.000]   Greg, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.600]   I was excited to be here today.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.320]   Just wanted to kind of run through some numbers for financial independence and just talk about
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.840]   that and see if I'm on the right track.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   I love the topic.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.720]   So tell me about your situation.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   Well I am 48 years old and I'm married with two young children.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   One is eight and one is six.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.200]   And my wife is a few years younger than me.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   She's 46.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   Okay.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.000]   What we, let's see, we, I guess what I'm trying to just kind of determine is I keep crunching
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.280]   numbers and really kind of thinking about financial independence and make sure that
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.600]   I am going in the right direction with all that and that the path is clear.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.960]   What's the best way to ask these questions?
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   How much money do you have?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.600]   How much money do I have in my pocket?
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.480]   No I have for retirement, sorry, let me just click this here.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.280]   So in retirement savings, I have about $790,000.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   Okay.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   And let's see, I, yeah, and I have a small mortgage.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040]   It's under $100,000 at this point.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.200]   And really no other debts, just monthly credit card debts that I pay off as I go.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   How much is your house worth?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.040]   Probably about 400.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   Okay.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.760]   Do you have any money or investments that's not represented in your house or in your retirement
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   accounts?
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.360]   I do.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:50.080]   I have, let's see, probably about $200,000 outside of that.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.720]   $100,000 of it I've kind of earmarked for college savings.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.120]   And I've already probably have about $30,000 in 529s.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.500]   Okay.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.760]   And the remaining $100,000 is just invested in stocks?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.840]   Yeah, in cash and yeah, cash and I have like kind of a personal loan out to a business
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   and things like that.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.120]   So all told, your investment assets between your retirement accounts and the $200,000
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.720]   other are about a million dollars and you live in a house worth about $400,000.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.880]   How much are you earning currently?
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.720]   Our household income is about a hundred.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   And how much do you spend every month?
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.320]   Five to 6,000.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   That includes our mortgage, that includes paying towards like an IRA, IRA contributions.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.280]   So taking out IRA contributions, you're just telling me the expenses.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.920]   How much are your monthly expenses?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   I'd say $5,000.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   Okay.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.040]   Because I've often thought if I was right now, if I was to reach a financial independence,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   if I was spending what I needed to and my house was paid off, that I would probably
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.480]   need about $50,000 a year is what I think.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.520]   So if you had a house paid off and you had an income of $50,000 a year from your investments,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520]   what would you do with your life?
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:31.400]   Well, that's part of why I'm calling Ask because I'm currently working in a position
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.880]   I get to really do what I love, but it's very kind of gig oriented.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.120]   So it's not a, I'm not a W2 employee.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.320]   I get to run through kind of my own business and serve people as they need it.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   And as I'm able to find this business, but it's not every day, but it pays really well
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.320]   and I really love it.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.280]   And it also gives me a lot of free time now to do a lot of things that I like.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.920]   So it's a good situation.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.360]   My spouse is the one that has the more formal job, a corporate job and brings the benefits
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.520]   home and things like that.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.200]   So it seems like we're, we have a really good kind of pairing right now and I would continue
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.960]   to do what I'm doing for as long as I'm interested in it.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.520]   And I could see that growing in the future as well.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.760]   So I guess I'm not too concerned about that part of it, but I would think, you know, if
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.000]   my wife could kind of cut back from her work in the near future, maybe, you know, so that
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   her life was a little more enjoyable for her.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.920]   Does she want to cut back?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.200]   I think if I think that the conversation would be easier if there was a, you know, a very
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.920]   clear path and she understood that that's a good option.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.040]   I think we need to address the benefits such as the healthcare.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.280]   You know, that's something important from her work.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.880]   But I think she would enjoy cutting back a bit and, you know, doing things she likes
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.840]   more than this.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.600]   But I think she's also very satisfied in her job at this time as well.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.480]   Last year, how much revenue did your business bring into your household?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   After my expenses?
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   Yes.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.760]   Yeah, so about 20, 25,000.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.520]   Could you increase that number to a higher number?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.400]   Yes.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.200]   About how much could you increase it to?
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:47.720]   I can definitely double that in a year, I'm sure.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.240]   If you were to double it, would you still continue to enjoy the work, the business,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.280]   the doing the gigs that you're doing?
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.800]   I'm afraid if I if I went on beyond doubling it, then it would would seem like a bigger
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.720]   business than maybe I would want to do, because it does involve traveling and, you know, just
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.120]   going around the country and things like that.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.400]   So I would I would think that that would kind of take away from some of this, because then
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.560]   I'd be away from home a lot more and not with the family and things that I do value
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.240]   greatly now.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.960]   How much longer do you and your wife want to continue to live in the house that you
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   live in?
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:39.880]   I am confident this is a forever home for us unless we were to downsize after the children
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.160]   were gone.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:50.680]   Would you want to downsize after the children are gone?
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.880]   If I made that decision, I would probably find something that was more simple and was
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   lower cost.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   But I love this house.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.360]   We're in the perfect location, so it's not something that's on my radar now.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.480]   So in my assessment, you are now financially independent, at least to a degree.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.520]   You are not financially independent such that you never have to work again the rest of your
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   life.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.360]   But I don't use that as the beginning point.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.840]   I use that as a nice kind of end benchmark.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.440]   But I consider you to be financially independent at this point in time.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.120]   And here's how I would explain that.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.780]   There's no decision in life that you couldn't make at this point in time.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   You could change jobs.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.780]   You could change businesses.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.040]   Your wife could change jobs.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.720]   She could change businesses.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   You could move.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   You could sell your house.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   You could move.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   You could do anything you wanted with your children.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.040]   You have enough cash available to you to make any decision that you want.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.640]   So you should now begin to operate from the perspective of financial independence.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.960]   Now, of course, one of your concerns is, well, I have to save for retirement.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.680]   And that's fine.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.920]   That's laudable.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.960]   But you are 48 years old and you have already saved for retirement.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.120]   So let me just give you an example bit of math here on your retirement portfolio that
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.920]   most people forget about.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.960]   You with about $800,000 of retirement savings are in the top few percent of U.S. American
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.880]   households in terms of wealth.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.840]   The vast majority of U.S. American households have nothing saved and have nothing saved
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   for retirement.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.280]   You're a millionaire.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.840]   You have a lot saved.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.760]   And so you should start thinking like a millionaire, thinking like someone who has a lot saved.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.540]   Pretend today that you never saved any more money for retirement and you just started
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.520]   with what you have right now.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.000]   So let's put that into a financial calculator to $800,000 of investments currently.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.720]   I'm just going to change it to negative.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.440]   I can't run a calculator these days.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.880]   OK, $800,000 in to your investments.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.400]   Let's put in a 20 year time horizon taking you from 48 to 68.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.800]   And Greg, what rate of return do you think that you will earn on your investments in
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.520]   the next 20 years?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.120]   Well, I never put the 11.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.000]   I usually put the 5 just to be conservative.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.200]   But I think realistically it would probably be around a 7 or an 8.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.600]   I'm comfortable with using 7, right?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.800]   So let's use 7, be a little bit conservative.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.320]   And no further contributions to that account.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.200]   So that would put you in a situation where at 68 years old, beginning with $800,000,
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.400]   if you could earn 7% per year over the next 20 years with a current value of $800,000
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.720]   with no further contributions, you could expect your retirement portfolio at age 68 to be
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.120]   worth about $3 million.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   The retirement calculator, the calculator says $3,095,000.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.760]   So about $3 million.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.960]   Now at age 68, would you be comfortable with having a portfolio of $3 million?
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.800]   Absolutely, because I feel that that kind of target financial independence number for
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.200]   me is less than that.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   So yeah.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   Okay.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.760]   So now we've assured that at 60...
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.640]   We've not assured, but there's a good chance.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.160]   We've used fairly conservative calculations here and we've squared away retirement.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.480]   So at this point in time, the goal is...
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.440]   The trick is to say, how can we plan for the next 20 years?
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.400]   Now if I take from you and I say to you and your wife, you are not allowed to save any
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:31.960]   money at all for the next 20 years, but you can't spend any money at all from your investments
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   for the next 20 years.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   Do you think...
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   Well, let me rephrase.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.320]   You can't spend any money from your retirement account.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.480]   You can spend the other $200,000 if you need to, but you can't spend any money from your
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.760]   retirement accounts in the next 20 years.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.160]   Do you think that the two of you could figure out a way to live a lifestyle that you would
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.360]   love and to pay for that lifestyle from your earnings?
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.680]   Yes.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.400]   And I think maybe that would have been a better way for me to phrase my question in the beginning,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400]   Joshua.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.440]   I'm kind of curious if we spent the next four or five years adding to that retirement and
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.080]   paying down that mortgage.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.400]   And then when we got to that point, then suddenly saying, okay, we just need to earn enough
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.800]   to pay the bills and forget about the savings and those other things.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.960]   And then suddenly our expenses are more like $4,000 a month.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.440]   And we go on and do work that we love to earn that 4,000, not ever touching that nest egg
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.240]   until later down the road.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.960]   Yeah, that's what I would do.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.400]   I would add one more wrinkle.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.240]   I think you should consider things in two ways.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   First, I think that you should think of things in terms of this 20-year time horizon, because
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.800]   20 years puts you at about Social Security retirement age.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   My hope is that you would never stop being productive and financially productive.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.200]   My hope is that you would never retire, but I know you'll want to be in a position where
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.980]   you would feel like you could if you wanted to.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.280]   So at 68, you want to have a retirement portfolio.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.640]   You're going to have that $3 million.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.080]   You would have additionally potentially Social Security income of some amount coming in at
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.800]   about that age.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.560]   And that's enough of a time horizon that you could legitimately look forward for that 20-year
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   period of time.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.400]   Now, I would additionally encourage you, based upon the age of your children, to think of
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.920]   the next 20 years almost in two separate 10-year chunks, because you're in a very crucial age
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.240]   with your children.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.440]   They're eight and they're six, which means that your input as a father really needs to
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.680]   happen for your eight-year-old in the next five to eight years, and for your six-year-old
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.640]   in the next seven to 11 years.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.760]   That basically, by the time your children are about 13, you need to have put into them
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.400]   the vast majority of the fatherly input that you're going to put into them.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.320]   Because by the time they reach age 13, that's when they start transitioning to adulthood.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.180]   That's when they start transitioning into adolescence.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.520]   That's when your role as a parent changes.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.840]   At this point in time, you are a parent.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.680]   Now, you'll always be a parent, but your role from about age 13 to, say, age 20, will change
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.480]   more into the role of a coach rather than a hands-on parent.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.560]   And your relationship with your children will also change in terms of the time that they
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.900]   have available and the time that you are able to spend with them.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.280]   That relationship will look very different at age 9 than it does at age 17.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.680]   So you're in that crucial stage in the next decade where your children are still in the
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.400]   child phase.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.800]   And I would encourage you to say that this next 10 years should look very different than
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.580]   the following 10 years.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.340]   Because 10 years from now, you'll have an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.960]   At that point in time, if you want to move and sell your house, you can easily sell your
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.240]   house, move into a beautiful one-bedroom condo on the lake or wherever you want to
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   live.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.280]   You can easily make any decision that you want to.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.600]   But you should think in terms of the next decade and your role as a father and your
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.280]   wife's role as a mother, and then the following decade at which your children will be more
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.780]   independent and you'll be transitioning into that empty-nest phase of life.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.040]   Those plans are probably going to be different.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.660]   But if I had to choose, I would rather see you taking more time in the next decade, less
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.320]   time for work, more time with your children, doing whatever those adventures are that you
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.520]   have planned for your children, focusing intently on teaching them, on instructing them on the
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.280]   way that they should go, and then do that in the next decade.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.200]   And then in the following decade, that's when, you know, ramp up the business.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.640]   Go ahead and start a new one.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.120]   Do whatever you're going to do in that next decade and commit that, you know, from years
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.880]   10 to 20 from now to heavy work or launching a totally new project, whatever that is.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.160]   Michael O'Hara, MD, PhD It does.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   It does.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   I enjoyed hearing that part because part of me wonders, well, you know, is it okay for
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.320]   me to not be out there, you know, hustling like crazy now?
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.200]   Because I do value that time with them and I do, you know, it serves a big function for
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.880]   my family, my flexibility and time too, which is great.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.200]   So it's something I'm not wanting to give up at this time because I do see a lot of
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.400]   people that don't have that opportunity to quite be there as a father like I do at this
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   time.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.360]   You mentioned that your work involves travel.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.880]   Do you take your children with you?
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.080]   I'm not afraid to, but it hasn't worked out like that.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:32.360]   Typically I try to really push the extremes of the travel to get there and back as fast
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   as possible.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.480]   And I don't usually stop and smell the roses too often.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   Of course.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.680]   So I just would encourage you, one thing to think about, and then let's go to one more
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.920]   specific that I want to talk with you about.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.560]   But I would encourage you, the most important thing that your children need at this stage
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.520]   of your life is to be with you.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.980]   They need you to teach them how to live.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.840]   They need you to teach them how to interact with others.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.880]   They need you to teach them how to treat other people, how to build business, whatever it
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   is that you're doing.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.280]   Your children need to have that interaction with you at this stage of your life.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.040]   And they're in a perfect phase for you to be working together with them.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.160]   So I wouldn't view it as either or.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.920]   Whether you work like a maniac or you spend all your time just hanging out with your kids.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.240]   I don't see a lot of value.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.760]   I see some value in having time to hang out with your children.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   That's fine.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.360]   But if you're just focusing on hanging out with your children, what are you teaching
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360]   them?
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.880]   They're not learning anything other than that life is about hanging out.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   And I deny that.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.440]   I don't believe that life is about hanging out.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   So what I would say is look at your families, talk with your wife, and look at your overall
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.640]   family structure and say, "How can we at this stage live a life of integrated family connection
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.560]   where we're involved in productive activities as a family, where those activities can be
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.960]   integrated with our children, not separated?"
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   Because you don't want just your children to learn, well, they go to school and they
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.080]   have all their instruction at school, but then they just hang out with dad.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.420]   Hanging out is fine, but working with dad, whether it's building an addition or going
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.720]   with you on your business trips, working with dad, in my opinion, is more valuable than
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   just hanging out.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.480]   So that's a lot of my philosophy.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.960]   You take it, you test it, you talk with your wife, see what it is about you.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.120]   But I don't think that I would...you are now financially independent.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.800]   So focus a lot on the next decade and think about how you can discharge this time period
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.760]   of your family responsibility in the most effective way possible with you, your wife,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.280]   your children, in a way that conforms to your vision for your family.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.760]   I want to talk just a moment about health insurance.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.980]   You mentioned that your wife has health benefits through her job.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.320]   And so of course, one concern is how to replace that.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.240]   Are there any other benefits that you have that you're concerned about?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:56.080]   Well, I mean, she has a great package for the dental and vision and 401k matches and
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.120]   all that good stuff that comes with a job like that.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.360]   And I would say that's the one that seems the hardest to replace would be the health
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   insurance.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.560]   Is anybody in your family sick?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.320]   No.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.880]   So this is a huge pet peeve of mine.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.440]   You'll hear me talk about it all the time.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.200]   But if neither of you is sick, you should not labor at the altar of health insurance.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.300]   Health insurance is designed to protect you from a catastrophic illness.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.400]   But statistically, if neither of you is sick and neither of you has a catastrophic illness,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:35.440]   then chances are that health insurance is not going to be a huge factor for you.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.560]   That would be different if you had a problem, had a physical problem.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.280]   Good friend of mine is in very bad physical shape, all kinds of medical issues.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.960]   And he works at a job for the government and he works there exclusively.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.020]   He doesn't need the money, but he needs the health insurance coverage.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.660]   It's reasonable if you have it.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.120]   But if you don't have it, don't buy into this weird American thing where it's all about
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.260]   working so that you can have health insurance.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.880]   You can go out and you can buy health insurance in the open market and you can just simply
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.660]   pay for it and you can plan for it.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.520]   There are all kinds of you, whether you go with a traditional health insurance policy,
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.020]   after the Affordable Care Act, that market became very difficult.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.720]   But my hope is that in the future, more options will be presented.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.360]   We'll see.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.920]   We're in this weird in-between legislative stage where some of the requirements of the
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.240]   Affordable Care Act were reversed and some of them were not.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.400]   Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, you could buy a catastrophic health insurance
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.820]   policy for your family for a couple hundred bucks a month.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.840]   Things like that should still be available in the future.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.600]   There's also health care sharing programs.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.440]   There are more of those coming on and the average cost there is only a few hundred dollars.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.360]   And you can pay for stuff out of pocket.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:56.000]   Dental insurance almost never works out in a positive sense in the terms of dental insurance
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.920]   is always capped on the upside.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.440]   So it gives you a little bit of benefit, but you can also just go to your dentist and just
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.460]   offer to pay them cash and you can get most of the same benefits cheaper by paying cash.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.920]   So figure out how to earn enough money to pay for health insurance, but build your life
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.240]   and your lifestyle first, beginning with an open slate, and just put health insurance
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.760]   on a list as something that needs to be solved rather than this insurmountable problem that
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   if I don't have a job, I can't get health insurance.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.440]   And hey, if that doesn't work, go get a job at Starbucks for health insurance like lots
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   of people do.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   Anything else, Greg?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   No, this is valuable.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.040]   Thank you so much.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.000]   Begin and build from a place of strength.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.200]   You are now financially independent.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.520]   Now act like it.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.680]   Build your life in the way that fits your vision.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.400]   You are now financially independent.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.680]   And from now going forward, you will have increasing levels of financial independence.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.400]   But don't buy into this lie that the financial advice industry says that you have to have
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.160]   your $3 million now to be financially independent.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.080]   You are now financially independent.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.640]   Even if you just earned $30,000 a year for the next five years and your wife quit her
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.420]   work and she came home and did nothing productive that brought no financial benefit to the family.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:18.960]   And for the next five years, you took $20,000 per year out of your savings so that you could
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.020]   spend your $50,000 a year.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.500]   Even if you did that, that would be fine.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.800]   You could do that if that was what you chose to do.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   And you wouldn't be stupid.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.820]   You've saved this money for a purpose.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.600]   So break it out into reasonable, thoughtful life stages that actually matter versus this
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.320]   monolithic, "I'm either working or I'm retired."
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.880]   That, in my opinion, is a bad formula for life.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   Richard, in Virginia, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   First time caller, long time listener.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:58.760]   I'm a retirement plan administrator by day and a husband and a father by night.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:05.400]   I'm in the beginning stages of trying to redo my life insurance.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.520]   And I do have about 1.5 million of term life insurance already in force.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.240]   I do have a young child who's three years old and I haven't redone my insurance since
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.080]   she was born.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   And my specific question is, I already have an existing relationship with an agent, but
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   he is not able to give me any quotes with any of the mutual insurance companies, to
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.640]   my knowledge.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:42.280]   And just due to my position with my employer, I've had the opportunity to informally interview
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.920]   several financial advisors just by way of the company to see what they offer to our
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.320]   executives, but haven't necessarily taken the personal step forward to contacting some
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.960]   of those agents who happen to work for the mutual insurance companies, if you will.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:06.040]   And after listening to several of your old podcasts on life insurance and with your particular
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:12.380]   work experience background, I was wondering if there really is any value to starting our
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:20.800]   new relationship with a captive insurance agent or just sticking with my current insurance
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   agent who won't be able to give me any life insurance quotes with the mutual insurance
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   companies.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:32.000]   So, it's a little bit of a muddle because it used to be clear, used to be there were
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.520]   captive agents and then there were independent agents.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.820]   And some companies only wrote their business with captive agents and some companies only
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.460]   wrote their business with independent agents.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:49.080]   That line is a little bit more, it's not as clear as it once was because there are companies
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.880]   that restrict their products only to their own representatives.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:00.920]   And I don't know of any company who does that, whose representatives can't write other products.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:07.120]   And there are mutual insurance companies that are represented by independent agents.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.740]   So it's not, so there are companies that you can buy the policies and they have both.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.000]   They sell their policies through captive agents and through independent agents.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.280]   The first thing that I would do is I would ask your current advisor, your current life
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.780]   insurance agent.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.940]   If they can become appointed with any of the companies that you are interested in.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:35.520]   It would be common that that particular advisor could gain an appointment with some large
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.960]   mutual insurance companies.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.480]   There are a number of them that do represent their products independently.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.680]   The general downside is usually an independent life insurance agent will not be as familiar
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.760]   with the ins and outs of those particular companies' products.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.600]   If you're dealing with a simple product, like a simple term life insurance product, or if
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.680]   you're dealing with a very simple traditional whole life insurance product, I don't think
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   there's any, that's a danger.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.080]   But if you're dealing with a more complex product, a hybrid product where it has a certain
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.700]   number of internal options, there you do want to make sure the agent that you're working
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.580]   with is well versed in the actual product.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.320]   So to begin with, do you feel like your current life insurance agent is competent and are
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   you satisfied with their service to you?
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:32.080]   I would say they do a good job.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.160]   They don't knock it out of the park in terms of impressing me, but they don't necessarily
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.840]   do anything wrong.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.600]   He is not a CLU, so I've learned the value of a CLU.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.400]   And so that concerns me a little bit.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:57.440]   If I'm not so much losing out per se, I'm not trying to express that concept, but just
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   is this the best for my family or should I just be keeping with the existing insurance
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   agent?
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.640]   So that's kind of my concern if you will, working with an existing agent and being independent,
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.480]   what am I losing out on?
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.560]   And then also not being a CLU, how much am I losing in that transaction, not having that
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.400]   certification behind this fellow's name?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   So here's what I say.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.320]   There's no reason for you not to meet with other people.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.040]   In anything in life, no matter how much you like somebody or appreciate somebody, you
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.400]   want to go ahead and get multiple sources of input, multiple quotes.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.760]   Now when I was an insurance agent, I of course would have liked it if my clients had loyalty
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.200]   to me and never wanted to talk to anybody other than me.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.760]   But the reality is they need to.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.440]   They need to talk to other people because that keeps me on my toes and that makes sure
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.220]   that they're served effectively.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.520]   If I'm not serving them to the best degree that they need, then they should be being
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.040]   served by somebody.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.840]   That's honest, that's forthright, that should be happening.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.480]   And the only thing I would always just ask is that if you're working with another agent
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   or if you are taking, you're collecting quotes, give me a shot, give me a shot.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.720]   Let me compete for the business.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.480]   All I want is a chance to compete, a chance to bid.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.240]   And so I don't see any reason for you not to go ahead and meet with other people, especially
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.280]   if there's an agent that's impressed you, because there very well may be that you'll
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.360]   get better service, you'll get better products, you'll get good and useful ideas.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.920]   And I think throughout life, we should always maintain an openness to new ideas.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.880]   Closed-mindedness is rarely a virtue.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.360]   Openness is usually a really good course of action on anything.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.200]   We shouldn't be scared of ideas, whether they're about the large existential problems of life
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.840]   or the simple application of how to do a life insurance analysis.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.920]   Chances are you will want to keep the insurance that you have in force currently.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   A good rule for anybody who has life insurance is you should always be highly skeptical of
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.280]   replacing any insurance coverage that you currently have.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.840]   Usually an insurance policy that you have will be better than any insurance policy that
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.920]   you could buy.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.340]   You bought it when you were younger.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.560]   You probably bought it when you were healthier.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.320]   You bought it when it was cheaper.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.720]   And unless some of those things have changed, unless you've magically become younger, ha-ha,
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.160]   or unless you've become healthier or it's become cheaper because you're looking at a
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.960]   different option, those are the only reasons why you should change.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.600]   So most likely you should keep all the insurance that you have in force.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.040]   That will allow you to make sure that your existing agent is still getting the commissions
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.720]   from the policies that he sold you.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.440]   And then if a new agent can suggest something else that does help you, that does materially
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.040]   help you, then at that point in time, it's up to the new agent.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   That's their job.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   Clear enough answer?
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   Any follow-up questions, Richard?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.600]   Richard D. Lawyer, MD No, that's very helpful.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.920]   That's exactly what I was looking for.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.320]   I was struggling with reconciling the idea in my mind of shopping around and being loyal
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.240]   and thank you for giving me your perspective.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   I appreciate that.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.280]   Tom Holland In financial relationships and financial sales,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   a lot of the strength of the interaction is based upon the relationship.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.600]   I believe the relationship is valuable.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.840]   I believe there's a value to loyalty to a person.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.280]   There really is.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:28.480]   I think that there are people that I do have interactions with that I'm happy to pay more
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   to, that I'm happy to get a slightly inferior product if such a thing were the case, in
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.480]   order to do business with that person.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.560]   So if your answer to me had been, "This life insurance agent is awesome," and there were
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   no hesitation in your voice, then I would say, "Well, just go with them because you're
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   going to get more value out of somebody who knows you than some tiny little product advantage."
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.640]   However, competition is a benefit.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.880]   And in order to put that into place, we've got to actually judge the competition.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.520]   You've got to actually go out and collect the quotes.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:08.120]   And going out and collecting the quotes will be important for you to know that you're getting
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   the best deal possible and you're doing the best thing for your family.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:18.220]   And it helps collectively to keep the entire industry of life insurance agents better.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.320]   If there were no competition, we'd have real problems.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.560]   So you're doing your part to feed that competition.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.000]   Kevin in Washington, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   How can I serve you?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Thanks for taking the call.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.120]   I had a hopefully simple question and maybe get your opinion on raising my cost basis
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.240]   in the context of a taxable investment account.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.120]   I understand it means paying taxes, but I just wanted to see what your thoughts were
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   upon that.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   Okay.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.120]   Tell me more.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.840]   I guess, what do you need to know?
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.880]   It's kind of an odd question, I think.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.320]   What investments do you own that you're thinking about selling?
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.920]   What's your cost basis and what's the value currently?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:10.320]   So just index funds, about 780K, possible 250 capital gains.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.940]   And why do you think, so you're basically referring to the concept of tax gains harvesting.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.160]   Why do you think this would be beneficial to you at this point in time?
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:27.880]   Well, I wasn't trying to, I guess, gain anything, but I just wanted to ping the taxes now instead
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   of just doing it later.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.560]   Is there any benefit to that, more or less?
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.640]   Do you have any reason to believe that the taxes will be lower now than they will be
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.440]   later?
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   I guess not necessarily.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.840]   I mean, the tax rate stayed fairly consistent over the last long time.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   I guess not.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.920]   All right.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.500]   So let me back up and just kind of explain the concept, first of all.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:05.960]   So when you own a capital gain asset, you choose when the tax will be due based upon
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.100]   when you realize and recognize the income.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.640]   So when you choose to sell it.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:18.560]   So if you have an asset such as a set of shares of a mutual fund or a piece of real estate
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.720]   property, there won't be any tax due on the property until you actually sell it and realize
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   the gains.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:31.600]   Now, in general, you never want to pay a tax that you can push off to the future.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.120]   The basic rule is any kind of expense that you can push off to the future, you always
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.120]   should.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.840]   So if I told you you can pay me a thousand dollars today or you can pay me a thousand
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.000]   dollars a year from now, you should always want to pay me a thousand dollars a year from
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.160]   now because you get the utility of using that thousand dollars today for the next year.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.700]   So any expense that we can push off to the future, that should always be our default
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.960]   option.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.320]   Same thing with any income, any income we can bring forward to today, that should always
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.400]   be our default option.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.760]   So if I gave you the option of having a thousand dollars today from me as income or a thousand
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.480]   dollars a year from now as income, you should take it today.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.640]   So you push expenses out and you bring income forward.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.360]   That's the default position.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.200]   Now if I adjust the numbers a little bit and I say to you, Kevin, you're going to incur
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.900]   an expense, would you like to incur a thousand dollar expense today or would you like to
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.820]   incur an eight hundred dollar expense a year from now?
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.400]   Well now all of a sudden you're going to go for the eight hundred dollar expense a year
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:42.440]   from now because you get the best deal of time to use the money and it's a discount.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.920]   Now if I flip it and I say, would you like to incur a thousand dollar expense today or
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.480]   a twelve hundred dollar expense a year from now?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.400]   Now you have to do a few calculations and you have to calculate and see, is it worth
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.260]   it to me to take the two hundred dollar discount in order to pay now versus later?
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.300]   So this is just basic planning.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.040]   Same thing with income, just in reverse.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.440]   This is basic planning.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.480]   So the basic rule of expenses is you push them out to the future and that applies to
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   taxes.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.360]   There's no reason to want to pay a tax today that you don't have to pay when you can pay
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.480]   it later.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.620]   So if you were just going to sell your index funds, incur the tax, and then move those
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.960]   index funds back and then buy the index funds again so that you've increased your tax basis
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:32.180]   in the account, there's no reason to do that unless it gets you some very valuable benefit.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.580]   So what are the valuable benefits that you could get?
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:41.060]   Well first of all, you might have some knowledge or guess about the direction of tax rates
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.320]   in the future.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.980]   So you might say, tax rates I think are going to go up.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:52.500]   If you believe that tax rates are going to go up in the future, then you might place
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.520]   your bet and say, it's better for me to pay the tax now at a lower rate and then in the
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.780]   future I won't owe so much tax.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.520]   So there you're making a guess about tax rates.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.640]   The information that you would need to make your guess about tax rates is what will the
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.940]   U.S. Congress do about tax rates in the future?
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.220]   Now if you can accurately predict that, you ought to take the microphone and take my job
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.220]   away from me.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.900]   That's a question that nobody really knows.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.720]   Everyone has guesses and your guess is as good as just about anybody else's, but nobody
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   really knows.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.860]   I'll go ahead and just tell you my guess on it.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.500]   My guess is that I don't think tax rates generally will go up.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:44.020]   The reason I don't believe that is I am persuaded that tax rates over the last 50 years have
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.900]   actually been on the whole fairly stable.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.100]   Now the tax brackets march around a little bit, but on the whole they've been fairly
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.140]   stable.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.540]   If you actually look past the political rhetoric during election season to what people actually
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:02.780]   do, there's very little change in what the politicians in the United States actually
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.260]   do.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.820]   During the election season, you'll generally hear Republicans say, "We need to cut taxes,"
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.020]   and you'll hear Democrats say, "We need to raise taxes on the rich," but you'll actually
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.380]   watch them.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.740]   And when they're in the middle of a recession, the Democrats sign on for tax cuts and Republicans
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.980]   sign on for tax increases in certain situations as well.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.900]   So on the whole, I don't think there's any political will for raising taxes.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.460]   And the only thing that I think personally would change that would be if the flow of
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.960]   money to the US federal government dried up.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.620]   But right now the US federal government spends out of deficits and out of debt, not out of
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.000]   tax revenue.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   So they never worry about adjusting their expenditures to the amount of tax revenue.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.200]   They just worry about borrowing more money.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.580]   So as long as they can borrow more money to pay for their bills, I don't see why they
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.940]   would change tax rates.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.380]   So I think that on the whole, tax rates are probably politically stable.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.780]   Again, cut out election season, and it seems like everybody actually does just about the
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.780]   same thing.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   Marc Thiessen: There are changes at the margin.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.620]   There are changes with a little bit of fiddling here with an estate tax exemption.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.460]   There's a little bit of fiddling there with a corporate tax, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:21.960]   But go and look it through and you find that for the last 50 years, it's been pretty stable.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.080]   Doesn't mean the future will be, but that's my guess.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.300]   Your guess may differ.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.560]   So tax rates are hard to predict.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.280]   What about tax brackets?
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.140]   Because the other thing that could happen for you is that you could be changing brackets.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:41.100]   Right now you might be earning $20,000 per year, but you know that you've got good idea
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.480]   that all of a sudden your income is going to go from $20,000 per year to $2 million
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.520]   per year.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.500]   This is where you can actually have inside knowledge on your situation.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.920]   If you think that your tax bracket is going to go up, either while you're working or in
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.560]   retirement, then in general, you want to pay at the lowest bracket, whenever you're going
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.160]   to be in the lowest bracket.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:08.520]   And here's where capital gains tax, tax gain harvesting does come into play.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.320]   If your income is low enough so that you could take advantage of the 0% capital gains tax
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.740]   rate, that can be a really wise thing to do.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.860]   So if your income, your earned income is low, then, and you say, okay, well I can go over
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:28.640]   here and I can go ahead and recognize $50,000 of gains and I can still stay in my 0% capital
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.080]   gains tax rate, tax bracket.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.880]   That can be really, really good because now you're paying tax, you're increasing your
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:41.200]   tax basis and you're not actually, you're increasing your tax basis and you're not actually
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.140]   paying any tax.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.440]   That's really good.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.680]   On the flip side also, and so if you knew, for example, that next year you're going to
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.240]   take a year off and your earned income is going to go to zero, well yes, absolutely
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.200]   start selling and take advantage of as much as you can to harvest those tax gains.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:03.080]   On the top end as well, if you think that you're going to realize the additional 3.8%
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:10.240]   Medicare tax tax on the very top end of tax rates, then also you might go ahead and trigger
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.720]   your gains now in order to avoid that in the future.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:19.740]   But in general, your default option should be, I'm not going to pay taxes today unless
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.600]   there's some compelling financial justification as to why that's in your best interest.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.440]   How does that, does that make sense to you?
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.440]   Absolutely.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.120]   I was having those same conversations in my head.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.320]   So this pretty much put it to bed to not sell anything, just to wait.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   Right.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:45.040]   And it's good because when you actually look at your taxes and you actually run the numbers,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.080]   here we get into the question of do you pay taxes from within the portfolio or pay taxes
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.880]   from outside of the portfolio?
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.200]   And all of the, you know, there are other tax analysis, points of tax analysis, same
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.160]   type of thing of someone asking, should I convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   and pay the tax?
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.840]   Well, where's the money coming from?
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.920]   And then what is going to be your tax brackets?
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:11.840]   But on the whole, if you're, if you don't have a need for the income, you don't have
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:17.460]   a something that you can spend it on, you're probably going to be in a lower tax bracket
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.060]   in the future than now during your high years of earning.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.920]   So the good general rule of thumb is just wait, just wait.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:30.560]   The other thing that can happen is I wouldn't do it unless something dramatically changed.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.880]   Let's say that you became sick and you couldn't work for a year.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.280]   Well, that would be the time.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.200]   Go ahead and start triggering gains and harvesting your gains.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.360]   Or again, as I already mentioned, you travel for a year, trigger your gains, or you retire,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.600]   trigger your gains.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.060]   But that is one wonderful about a capital gain asset is you can control when those gains
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.060]   come in.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.120]   Any other questions, Kevin, or clear enough for now?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.720]   No, that's wonderful.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   Thank you.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.000]   Thank you for calling in.
