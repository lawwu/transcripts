I speak into the ether right into your ears without getting to hear back from you. But on Fridays, we open up the phones and I get to talk to you, a real live person. Each Friday that I can arrange the technology in order to do so, I host a live Q&A call. This works kind of like talk radio where I can

[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.060]   We're going to do a live Q&A call and we're going to have a conversation about what we want to talk about. We're going to talk about anything that you want to talk about. These calls are open to patrons of the show. You can find out more information about how to become a patron at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. But I would encourage you if you would like to talk to me, ask me questions, discuss anything about your personal situation. This is the place to do it. I love doing these and I know from many of you, you love hearing them. So today we begin with Greg in Pennsylvania. Greg, welcome to RadicalPersonalFinance.com. How can I serve you today?
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hello, Joshua. I was excited to be here today. Just wanted to kind of run through some numbers for financial independence and just talk about that and see if I'm on the right track.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   I love the topic. So tell me about your situation.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:28.040]   Well, I am 48 years old and married with two young children. One is eight and one is six. And my wife is a few years younger than me. She's 46.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   The wife is 46.

[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:25.200]   So in retirement savings, I have about $790,000. And I have a small mortgage that's under $100,000 at this point. And really no other debts, just monthly credit card debts that I pay off as I go.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.220]   How much is your house worth?
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:58.020]  ,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   I have about $400,000.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   Okay.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.060]   Do you have any money or investments that's not represented in your house or in your retirement accounts?
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   I do.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   I have, let's see, probably about $200,000 outside of that. 100 of it I've kind of earmarked for college savings. And I've already probably have about $30,000 in 529.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   So I have about $300,000 in 529.

[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   But I haven't necessarily taken the personal step forward to contacting some of those agents who happen to work for the mutual insurance companies if you will.
