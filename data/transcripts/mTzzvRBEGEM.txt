[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   - You're, if I may say so,
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.280]   one of the richest people in the world.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.800]   So you're a good person to ask, does money buy happiness?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   - No, it's been shown that once you get over
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.640]   a basic level of income, so that you can take care
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.720]   of the pain, you know, health and whatever,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.600]   there's no correlation between the level of happiness
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.960]   that one has and the level of money that one has.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   That thing that has the highest correlation
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180]   is quality relationships with others, community.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240]   If you look at surveys of these things
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   across all surveys in all societies,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.160]   it's a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.100]   That is not in any way correlated with money.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.620]   You can go down to native tribes in, you know,
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.960]   very poor places or you can go in all different communities.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.680]   And so they have the opportunity to have that.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.480]   I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.800]   so I had the full range.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   I can tell you, you know, by not having money,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.400]   and then having quite a lot of money,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.520]   and I, you know, I did that in the right order.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.360]   - So you started from nothing in Long Island.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.120]   - Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.680]   but I had all really that I needed
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.280]   because I had two parents who loved me
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.440]   and took good care of me, and I went to a public school
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.280]   that was a good public school,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.600]   and basically, you know, you don't need much more than that
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.460]   in order to, that's the equal opportunity part.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.280]   Anyway, what I'm saying is no, I experienced the range,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.160]   and there are many studies on the answer to your question.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   No, money does not bring happiness.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.120]   Money gives you an ability to make choices.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   - Does it get in the way in any way
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   of forming those deep, meaningful relationships?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.120]   - It can.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.840]   There are lots of ways that it makes negative.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   That's one of them.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It could stand in the way of that, yes, okay,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   but I could almost list the ways that it could stand,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.320]   it could be a problem.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   - Yeah, what does it buy?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.080]   So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   - At the most fundamental level,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   it doesn't take a whole lot, but it takes enough,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   that you can take care of yourself and your family
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.000]   to be able to learn, do the basics of,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.280]   have the relationships, have healthcare,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   the basics of those types of things.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.080]   You know, you can cover the patients,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.800]   and then to have maybe enough security,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   but maybe not too much security.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.920]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.240]   - That you essentially are okay.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.160]   Okay, that's really good.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.640]   And you don't, that's what money will get you.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.040]   - And everything else could go either way.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   There's no correlation. - Well, no, there's more.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.280]   - There's more. - Okay.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.960]   Then beyond that, what it then starts to do,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.600]   that's the most important thing.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.480]   But beyond that, what it starts to do
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.980]   Okay, so for example, now I, you know, like in my case,
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.560]   those dreams might not be just my own dreams,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.220]   they're impact on others' dreams, okay?
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.840]   So my own dreams might be, I don't know,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.100]   I can pass along these, at my stage in life,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.800]   I can pass along these principles to you,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.320]   and I can give those things, or I can do whatever,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   I can go on an adventure, I can start a business,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   I can do those other things, be productive,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.200]   I can self-actualize in ways
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.780]   that might be not possible otherwise.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.560]   That's my own belief.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.480]   And then I can also help others.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.280]   I mean, this is, you know, to the extent,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.920]   when you get older, and with time, and whatever,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.320]   you start to feel connected, spirituality,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.440]   that's what I'm referring to,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360]   you can start to have an effect on others
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   that's beneficial, and so on, gives you the ability.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.620]   I could tell you that people who are very wealthy,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.840]   who have that, feel that they don't have enough money.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   Bill Gates will feel almost broke,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.520]   because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish,
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.240]   through the Gates Foundation and things like that,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.640]   you know, oh my God, he doesn't have enough money
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.920]   to accomplish the things he wishes for.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.760]   But those things are not, you know,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.080]   they're not the most fundamental things.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   So I think that people sometimes think money has value.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.960]   Money doesn't have value.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.980]   The money is, like you say, just a medium of exchange
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.340]   at a store, although, well, and so what you have to say
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.880]   is what is it that you're going to buy?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.600]   Now, there are other people who get their gratification
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.960]   in ways that are different from me,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.000]   but I think in many cases, let's say somebody
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.360]   who used money to have a status symbol,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.720]   what would I say, or that's probably unhealthy.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.600]   But then, I don't know, somebody who says,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.640]   I love a great, gorgeous painting,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.440]   and it's gonna cost lots of money.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.360]   In my priorities, I can't get there.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.000]   But that doesn't mean, who am I to judge others
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.560]   in terms of, let's say, their element of the freedom
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.680]   to do those things.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.400]   So it's a little bit complicated,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.120]   but by and large, that's my view on money and wealth.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   (silence)
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.440]   (silence)
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.600]   (silence)
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.760]   (silence)
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.920]   (silence)
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.080]   (silence)
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.240]   (silence)
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
