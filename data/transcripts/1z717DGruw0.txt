[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Last week Jerry Seinfeld as part of the promotional tour for his new Netflix movie frosted
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.340]   Did an interview on the honestly podcast with Barry Weiss now. They covered a lot of territory, but there was a
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.400]   remarkable 10-minute run that occurred roughly between the
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.580]   16 and a half minute mark in the 25 minute mark where Seinfeld peeled off
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.200]   Multiple deep ideas that are very relevant to the types of things we talked about here on this podcast and in particular
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.700]   How to cultivate a deep focused life in a distracted world
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.000]   So what I did here is I grabbed four of the most interesting quotes from Jerry during this period
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   I will read each of these quotes and then I will respond to them
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.440]   Helping to identify the wisdom in the quote and offering a few thoughts of my own. So we have our own sort of
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.560]   Seinfeld Ian Talmud session that we're doing today. I'm excited about this
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.440]   Now let's start with the first lesson. Here's the setup
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   Barry asked Jerry if it's true that he still writes
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.520]   With a legal pad and a ballpoint pen. This is something about a decade ago that Jerry Seinfeld
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.560]   Noted in a New York Times interview and Barry is saying is that still true? All right. Here's Jerry's exact quote
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.960]   It's nice
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.080]   When you write comedy and excuse this pretentious analogy, but it's a lot like poetry
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   You don't do a lot of writing. It's 90% thinking
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.800]   10% actual writing but the feeling of a ballpoint pen on a thick yellow pad is very pleasant
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.760]   It's like a warm bath to me
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.720]   All right. I think there's a really important point lurking in here beyond just a specific tool that Jerry uses. It's his indifference
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   To the details of the efficiency of his tools
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.640]   That we should really care about because it gets to the difference between two different notions of productivity on
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.600]   The one hand we have what a lot of us are familiar with it's what I call process productivity on the other hand
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.720]   You have what Jerry Seinfeld cares about which is what we can call creative productivity
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.320]   now process productivity is where you have a sequence of defined steps and you want those steps to occur as
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.840]   quickly and low cost as possible
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   if I have a assembly line that makes pop-tarts see I'm doing a pop-tarts reference here because of Jerry's new movie if I have
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.120]   An assembly line that makes pop-tarts. I want that line to go as quick as possible and as low cost as possible. So in
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.840]   process productivity
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.640]   You care a lot about the tools
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.920]   How exactly does this machine put icing on the pop-tarts if there's a faster way to do it, that's better
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.600]   How exactly do we put the little icing?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   Twist on top of the main frosting. Hey, if we have a tool that does that faster or cheaper, that's better, right?
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.920]   That's often how we think when we're confronting
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.040]   Productivity tools for us as individual knowledge workers. We think like well, what's this going to make faster?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.520]   Is this going to connect my thoughts to other thoughts? Is it going to seamlessly?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.500]   Let me move between formats. Will it auto fill in or correct my typing?
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.840]   Can it even help me think on my behalf by showing me connections between thoughts?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.960]   We want the tools to be faster and more featured as a way to get more productivity. That's process productivity
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.120]   Jerry cares about creative productivity, which is how do I produce the best stuff over time when it comes to creative productivity?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   The tools don't matter much
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.780]   How fast I write how many features I have in my writing software makes a negligible difference in
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.600]   The ultimate quality and quantity of what I write think about writing in particular
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.360]   This is something we've been doing professionally for a long time
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.160]   We've had big publishing houses in the American context since you know, the Revolutionary Period right? This is something we've done for a long time
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.840]   the tools by which
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.120]   Writers now write are way more efficient than they've ever been before
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.160]   Look even in my own lifetime
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   When I was copy editing my first books, which I wrote in the the early 2000s
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.760]   They would FedEx you a big printed manuscript with red colored pencils using to do all the corrections
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.560]   you had to learn all the copy editing marks because you had all these efficient marks that indicate what you meant and
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.360]   You had to go through each of these things and respond to them with a different color pencil
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.920]   I mean you would
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.880]   Check mark things you would cross things out
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.920]   You would make your own corrections and flag them in the margins and then you have to go to the post office
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.800]   I remember this so well and put this big thing in a I'd use like a priority mail
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.360]   Giant envelope and mail it back to Random House and hope it didn't get lost because there was no other copy of this, right?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.080]   And now of course we use Microsoft Word and track changes. It's faster
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.600]   Hemingway would pound out
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.640]   Each word of his books or a short stories on a Corona typewriter
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   Now we can copy and paste in a word processor. It's better, right? It's more efficient
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.440]   But Hemingway wrote a lot and in fact if we look at how much work authors produce
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.200]   We don't see some major change where as the tools got better authors produced
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.760]   More writing as the tools got better
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.560]   We don't see a change that authors produced better writing because ultimately creative acts take a long time. It's much more about the actual
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:24.000]   Thinking the construction of the original idea the original voice Jerry's case the original joke. This is what really matters
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.720]   This is something that is tool agnostic
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.080]   It is just the very last mile of creation where you actually record that on something and yeah
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.280]   It's a little bit easier if that's Microsoft Word instead of a typewriter and a typewriter certainly easier
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.680]   Then it would be writing this on a scroll, but it's the last mile of this long creative process
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.960]   So it doesn't in the long run affect the quality when I produce or how much I produce
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   Creative productivity is different than process productivity. If you are a knowledge worker
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.480]   You're much closer to the creatives than you are to the processes
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   You're much closer to the Seinfelds and the Hemingways than you are to the pop-tart factory
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.760]   So there's a good lesson here. Do not get caught up in a process productivity mindset
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.880]   Updated your tools as a knowledge worker can make your life less annoying on the margins, but is largely
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.400]   orthogonal
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   To how much high-quality stuff you produce and how quality those things actually are
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.640]   All right lesson number two from the Seinfeld interview
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.160]   Here's the setup Barry Weiss asked Jerry
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.960]   Do you have a special place?
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.520]   You like to write. I so here's Jerry's exact quote in response. I
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.040]   Do but I could write right here. If you would all just leave me alone
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.360]   Give me a flat surface and I'm good to go. This is the other thing I believe in there is no writer's block
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.840]   There's no writer's block. There's lazy. They're scared
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.400]   But there's no writer's block
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.280]   Just sit down and realize you're mediocre and you're gonna have to put a lot of effort into this to make it good
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   That's what writing is
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.200]   But I think we can generalize this to a lot of creative or cognitive pursuits
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.000]   They're hard
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.080]   Why are they hard?
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.840]   well, we can get neurological about this if we want to the human brain is evolved to do lots of things pretty well and
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.760]   Because we're evolved to do certain things
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.560]   we don't feel a lot of strain or resistance to doing them if I see a
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:28.440]   Animal in the distance that I want to hunt and I'm hungry. I'm evolved to very accurately aim a spear
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.800]   There's a lot of calculations and machinations that go on within our neural circuitry
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   But I can aim that spear especially with some practice in a way
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.240]   That's really quite amazing and have a good chance of hitting that animal. I don't feel resistance to it
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   It's something I'm doing that I'm evolved to do
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.280]   abstract cognition
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:52.680]   what we some researchers call symbolic processing where we're taking these mechanisms that are meant to encounter a concrete world and we turn them inward and
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.600]   Say, let's work on an internal abstract world
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   let's deal with abstractions like writing and concepts and ideas and theories that we're then going to try to wrench into
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.840]   written words or computer code or a
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.920]   Design for an ad campaign. We're not evolved to do this. We're again. We're wrenching
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.680]   Mechanisms meant for a much more embodied physical cognition and we're reassigning them to this more abstract work
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.800]   Our minds not on board with this and so we feel resistance
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   this is why if you sit down to write a report or an article or a
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.200]   novel
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.280]   You really have a hard time getting started. So your mind's like I don't know what this is
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.920]   This is not throwing a spear now
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.600]   It gets easier because once you get going what happens is is you load up all the relevant cognitive context, right?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.440]   Now your brain is activating the networks that are relevant to what you're writing
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.320]   It's inhibiting the networks that aren't relevant to it anymore. You get into a cognitive groove and things rolls along much better
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   So what this tells us is don't expect it to be easy, but it will get easier as you go along
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.920]   So just go do it
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.040]   Stop thinking about the muse
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.800]   Stop imagining that
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.240]   Your cognitively demanding process that it's just the mood was just right or your skills were just right or the circumstance was just right
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.960]   It's gonna come effortlessly
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.920]   Don't obsess over Mahaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   Maybe you'll get some flow. Probably not. It's just hard
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   What you're doing at first isn't good and the way things become good is you put them down and work and work and work on
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.560]   them
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.440]   This is certainly my experience writing
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.200]   It's in particular my experience when I work on a New Yorker piece just because the demands of the language is very high
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.480]   There's no other way to go about those
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.080]   But they're just right and right and right and go back and fix and right and just trust over time
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   You will be able to build from your natural mediocreness into something that might actually work
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.560]   So I think Jerry is really on to something there now
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   This doesn't mean now here's the subtlety of this look at what his very first two words of his answer
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   I do the question was do you have a special place to write and he said I do
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.840]   So this doesn't mean that location is something you should be indifferent to it can help
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.480]   Talk about this all the time on the show
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.040]   if you have a location that you
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.480]   associate exclusively with a certain type of deep work
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.740]   It will be easier to get into those deep work sessions. Not easy easier if you have a ritual you do
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.720]   consistently, but before
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.000]   Deep work sessions. It will make it easier to do that deep work not easy, but easier
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.600]   But you don't have to have that and even with that it's going to be hard
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.640]   So I like his mindset of you should be willing to just find a flat surface and go or whatever
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.480]   Your equivalent of a flat surface is for the creative endeavor that you are involved in. There's one thing
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.920]   I'm gonna add to Jerry's wisdom here. Hey, it's Cal
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.960]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need to check out my new book
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   slow productivity the lost art of accomplishment without
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:51.120]   Burnout. This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talked about here in these videos
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.780]   You can get a free excerpt at cal Newport calm
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.600]   Slow I know you're gonna like it. Check it out. Now. Let's get back to the video
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   A writer's block is largely invented. I agree with that
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.280]   Writing is hard feeling harsh wouldn't be a problem
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.600]   There is however an interpretation of it that I think is useful if you're really consistently
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.860]   Having difficulties mustering motivation to work on a creative project, especially if it's a new or bold idea
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.880]   Sometimes this is your mind's way of telling you that your plan stinks
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.120]   Right is the concept we talked about often on the show is that procrastination in many cases is your mind correctly pointing out?
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.640]   You don't really know what you're doing. Our mind has a way of projected into the future
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   Simulating the plan for what you're about to do trying to get to the results of this plan so it can then
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.000]   Evaluate those results and say if this is positive
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.160]   I'll give you motivation to do what we're about to do and if this is negative I won't
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:59.680]   Right again, this goes back to the Paleolithic. I'm in the late Ice Age. I'm hunting a mammoth. I have this idea
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.920]   Here's what I'm going to do
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   I'm gonna run and jump off this cliff
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:09.000]   Onto the back of the mammoth and club it in the head with a rock until it dies and you find yourself having a hard
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.560]   Time actually pulling the trigger to run and jump
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.580]   Well, it's because your brain has simulated this pretty effortlessly and said I probably will
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.080]   A break my legs as I fall off the cliff and to be stomped to death by a mammoth
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.440]   That doesn't seem like a really good outcome. So let's withhold motivation
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.280]   You know, like that's maybe not a good plan and someone else comes along and says why don't we throw a spear from a distance?
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.840]   Your brain thinks about that. It's like that'll probably work. We won't get stopped and I like meat and you get motivation to do it
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:39.240]   It's an adaptive and it's an adaptive reaction, but when it comes to creative pursuits, it still comes to play
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.600]   So you want to write a novel and you've fallen in love with like you got this like perfect
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:52.760]   Set up where you're gonna do your writing every morning with just the right tea and you just love the the accoutrements of the the novelist
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.000]   Lifestyle, but you don't really know anything about novel writing
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.200]   You don't know like what does it take to break into the type of writing you're trying to do?
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.520]   Are you good at it? Have you been evaluated? What's the process? Did you have an agent first?
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.200]   Did you be working with an editor? You didn't really do any of that work
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.840]   So your brain is unable to simulate with confidence a future that it trusts. So it's like I don't think so
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.640]   Motivation with help. So that is the one distinction. I'll give to Jerry's advice
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.760]   If you really have block on a creative pursuit
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:24.200]   Make sure first you really understand how that pursuit works and you have a plan going forward that you have some faith can actually succeed
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.920]   Then resistance beyond that point you gotta just find a flat surface and write
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.240]   All right, let's see here lesson number three
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.060]   Barry asked him Jerry
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.000]   about the importance of place
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.680]   Meaning like where you live. All right, here's Jerry's response
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.040]   It's hugely essential
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.800]   cataclysmically relevant and potent to your
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.600]   Psychophysical well-being and productiveness the importance of place to me
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.280]   The analogy is the tuning fork you have a rhythm a frequency a vibration as a human being
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:08.000]   When you were in the place that your frequency vibration matches the frequency vibration of the place then you're comfortable
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   Now this fits perfectly
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.840]   With the notion of lifestyle centric planning that we talk about all the time on the show now if you're new to the show
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.160]   You should listen to last week's episode
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:25.920]   I get into the dangers of just assuming that a singular grand goal is going to make your life suddenly meaningful and intentional
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   We often tell ourselves this fairy tale
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.200]   Accomplish some singular grand goal and your whole life will be good
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.120]   The much more consistent way of building a life that you find meaningful and intentional is to actually figure out
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.160]   what are all of the elements of such a life and
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:48.480]   Then systematically creatively and flexibly work towards those properties using all of the resources to your available that you have available to you
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.120]   It's not as sexy
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.040]   It's just I've got this grand idea that impresses my roommate when I tell him and if I succeed all is going to be good
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   But you're also much more likely to make progress
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.720]   One of the key things when we type talk about lifestyle centric planning is where you live
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.640]   I don't mean specifically necessarily like this neighborhood or this city, but the type of place you live
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.440]   I always talk about that when you vision your ideal lifestyle that you're going to now work towards part of this vision has to be
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.120]   What is the place like where you live?
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.840]   Are you walking out of the cabin on to the Sun Dapple pond where you're gonna sit quietly with your coffee and watch?
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.760]   Like the row at Walden the ice melt as you get your thoughts going for the day
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   Or is it going to be a sort of high energy? You're in a city
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:36.680]   You know, you're on your way the the see a reading of an experimental play that people are interesting artistic types of of all sorts of
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   diverse interesting backgrounds that just what what catches your attention
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   Seinfeld here is emphasizing why that's important
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.400]   I always talk about resonance when we do lifestyle centric planning work backwards from what resonates
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.480]   He uses a tuning fork analogy. What a tuning forks do they resonate?
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.840]   So he said yeah, this is really important the right type of place for you
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.000]   Creates a resonance. It's a rhythm. You're comfortable the wrong type of place. It doesn't work
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.800]   So the type of place you are matters. So again, if you follow the grand goal
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.280]   The grand goal theory this is the type of thing that you might neglect the grand goal theory might say, okay
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.480]   Whatever. I want the highest possible achievement in the field on it
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.160]   I want to find a job does my passion or something like this, right?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.600]   Or I want to finally succeed in you know, selling a novel and being a novelist, right?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.120]   You're just focusing on one thing
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:35.420]   But if you're focusing on one thing all the other attributes your life get pulled around randomly so in pursuing that goal
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.760]   Hey, I got into banking out of school because it was the hardest job
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.120]   And if I can become a managing director and make a million five a year then that's then I'm going to be happy
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.680]   You're following that goal with singular focus. You don't realize I hate cities. This is not resonating with me. I'm miserable
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.120]   It makes me anxious because you weren't thinking about the whole lifestyle. You're thinking about just one thing
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.200]   So think of the whole lifestyle location should be a big part of it Jerry
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.560]   Emphasizes that and in case you're wondering for Jerry, it's New York the rhythms of New York
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.680]   I mean, he's being nice about LA which is where he was to record this interview
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:14.640]   But but clearly his time in LA filming Seinfeld. He learned that's not his place the rhythms of New York
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.080]   That's the place the type of place he needs to be
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.320]   Alright, we got a fourth and final lesson here
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.280]   The setup is Barry is discussing with Jerry
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:32.780]   The meaning of life the importance Jerry places on craft. They started deep things, right? All right. So Jerry has a cool quote here
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.740]   It's all beautiful. He's referring here to life
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:45.240]   But I really but not really until we do something with it make something do something the hard is the good I
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.200]   Think I was about eight
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.960]   And I remember where I was the exact Street and I was on my bike just pedaling and I remember it hitting me that there
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.920]   Was a lot going on and I just wanted to do something really hard
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.840]   So I love this idea
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.800]   Should resonate with people who have read my book so good
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.400]   They can't ignore you or have read my new book slow productivity and a particular principle three obsess over quality
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.640]   I love this idea that the heart is good. It's in the pursuing of something hard and
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.120]   Making progress in that pursuit that we do gain a lot of our meaning as humans now
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   We know this from psychology if we look at self-determination theory Ryan and Decky for example
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   Or they look at what are the elements you need for motivation and thriving psychologically?
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.040]   one of the big ones there was
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.840]   mastery
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.320]   Mastering something and doing something. Well humans really like that. And again, I'm gonna use a lot of these sort of paleolithic
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.280]   Evolutionary biology just so tales but some of them are so obvious that we can just sort of
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Stipulate that they're true
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.440]   Clearly it's important for our species that mastery felt good
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.120]   By getting better at hard things is what allowed us to what we call
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.760]   Biologists would call refine our extended phenotype in other words
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.320]   Extend what it is
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.400]   We are able to do in the world beyond just with what physically we have on our body with how we're born not just our arms
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.200]   And our legs, but we can master throwing spears that extends our phenotype. We can master art that extends our phenotype
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   We can master language we can master
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:23.160]   Strategy all of this this extended phenotype this ability to gain and master new skills throughout life
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.760]   Is very important to human survival and it feels really good
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.200]   Now here's a key lesson, right? I mean, this is a podcast about
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   Navigating the promises and perils of technology and pursuit of a deeper life technology plays a big role in thwarting
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.000]   The Seinfeld the envision of the heart is good
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.280]   Technology wants to trick you especially modern consumer facing internet mobile technologies wants to trick you
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.520]   Into thinking your online activities that these are hard
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:59.280]   That you're a cruel of these sort of fake followers online and the retweets means that you're a leader. This was a hard to do
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.880]   It's not really that your progress in the video game
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.920]   That you have a higher ranking among the wizards in World of Warcraft command duty, you know, whatever
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.200]   Means that you've built up skill that gives you respect among your fellow tribe members
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.640]   But these aren't real people and these skills are easy to learn the games are set up so that you'll make progress on these skills
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.120]   Regularly, it's made up. So you always feel better like you you just got a glorified participation trophy now
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.580]   You're even better at shooting digital Nazis on your TV screen in the basement
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.720]   The digital wants you to think that you're you're angry
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.080]   rantings on social media versus your perceived
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.320]   Political or ideological enemies is somehow moving the arc of progress forward that it matters that you're part of the change
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.680]   What they don't realize is that you're actually on the set of the Truman Show
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.400]   You're yelling in an empty warehouse and your sound is being bottled and monetized
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.080]   To help a small number of stockholders these social media companies. You're not changing the world
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.340]   You're changing the number of zeros on someone like Mark Zuckerberg's annual worth
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.960]   All right. So technology
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   survives in part by subverting this
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.760]   Instinct towards mastery. Don't let it
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.720]   seek real mastery
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.680]   Not the low-friction digital kind but real mastery. There's unambiguous stakes and reward where it's hard to make progress, but you know for sure you did
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.400]   This is a really important part of living a deep life in a technological world
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:31.000]   Alright, so let's pull together all four of these lessons from this 10-minute run. This is Barry Weiss
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.920]   Interview of Jerry Seinfeld. All right, if I was going to summarize
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.440]   This sort of scripture of Jerry Seinfeld here work hard
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.920]   Over time on something you care about don't worry about your tools too much
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.060]   But just put in the work a day after day live in a location that resonates with you
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.640]   But don't get caught up about having the perfect immediate surroundings just to get started each day put in the hours
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.280]   The heart is good. All right, Jerry
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.960]   I know you didn't mean the sort of right and oral self-help manifesto
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.820]   But you are on to something my friend and I appreciated
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.560]   your lessons
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:14.360]   All right, so we can move on now with our questions before we do. However, let's hear a word from some of our sponsors. I
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.080]   Want to talk first about our friends at element
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:24.480]   LMNT now, you know element as the drink mix that gives you those electrolyte levels
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.240]   You need to recover from a hard day a workout from where you're real dehydration
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.140]   No sugar, no artificial nonsense. Just what you need
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.160]   Gives it to you pure they have a new offering now that I'm particularly exciting about
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.280]   So instead of just the drink mix you add to your own water. They have something now called element
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.300]   Sparkling that delivers that same zero sugar electrolyte formulation. You already know and trust but in a
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:59.480]   16 ounce can of sparkling water. You can just grab it cold from your fridge, which I am really excited about
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:06.760]   No sugar, no caffeine. Just all the electrolytes you need now in a 16 ounce can
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.040]   So this is beginning to roll out and I'm excited about this
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.840]   offering that they have
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.320]   So you can get some now, all right, so here's how this works you can get a free sample pack
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.600]   with any drink mix purchase at drink element comm

[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.520]   Insiders and if you're not sure if you're an element insider or not, just check out drink element comm and I'll explain it
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.360]   But anyone who makes a drink mix purchase will get a free sample pack of the standard element drink mix
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.660]   You know my youngest son Jesse. He's in kindergarten learning how to read
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.280]   He was asking he came in this was last night. He's like, what is and he spelled it out
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.920]   Like what is LM in tea because I drink a lot of element
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.040]   That's what I do after my workouts and it's on the lower shelf and he's learning to read and so we had to explain
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.760]   Like oh, we're probably setting back his reading here a little bit. He's like, well that stands for element. There's no vowels in it
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.240]   So he's probably thinking like, all right. Yeah, I mean I see how reading works
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.960]   He just sound things out. So elemental hydrates you but it might mess up your kindergartners reading comprehension
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.720]   So anyways, go to drink element comm slash deep get your free sample pack with any drink mix purchase

[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.400]   Also want to talk about our friends at Shopify
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.420]   Selling a little or a lot

[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.120]   ecommerce experiences because there's so many different websites large and small that are powered by Shopify software, so if you've had a
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:32.560]   Recently a really good online shopping experience probably Shopify was behind it when Jesse and I start our sort of long
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.920]   I'm gonna say promise. I mean I should say long threatened online store for the deep questions podcast
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.840]   There's no doubt about what tech will use for that. It will be Shopify
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:49.240]   All we need to figure out is what to sell details, but once we figure that out, of course, we'll be using Shopify
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.480]   To sell whatever it is. We sell. All right. Here's the good news
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.880]   You can sign up now for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify comm slash deep
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.520]   The key to get that discount is to type that all in lowercase letters
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:12.200]   Shopify comm slash deep go to Shopify comm slash deep right now to grow your business no matter what stage you're in that

[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.280]   Deep. All right. Let's move on now to some questions
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.840]   All right, Jesse. Who's our first question today? I first questions from Giacomo
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.560]   Can I take advantage of projects at work to improve my craft or is dedicated outside practice time necessary?
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.680]   Well jack well, that's an interesting question
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.760]   And it gets to I think it a key point
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.200]   I don't really want to say confusion
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.160]   But it's a little bit of a little bit of a confusion that people have around
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.680]   Practicing skills, right? So your idea that you're you want to practice skills makes sense
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.200]   I've been talking about this for a long time that if you have a knowledge work job
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.640]   And you really want to build up the career capital?
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   That's going to give you leverage over the the day-to-day reality of your working life. You have to identify
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.800]   What is it that I do that is most valuable?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:08.000]   unambiguously valuable to my organization or the market and you have to practice and improve that skill systematically and
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's how you get options
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.640]   That's how you're going to ultimately craft a job. You feel passionate about so Giacomo is asking
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.920]   When when and how do I practice these skills? No, so here's the confusion. I want to bring up
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.520]   when we think about practice
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.640]   What are the types of fields we typically think about we think about musicians we think about?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.800]   Chess players we think about athletes, right? We think about the endeavors where we actually
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.880]   Explicitly talk about practice. We explicitly schedule times for practice
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.920]   My son plays baseball. He has baseball practices. He goes to
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:52.160]   Here's the confusion. Those are really the exception not the norm when it comes to how you build skills this idea that you can have these
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.040]   abstract
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   isolated practice sessions
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.240]   where I'm going to go for example to a baseball field and take grounders and
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   Work in the cage in this like isolated abstract way so that later when I'm playing baseball. I'll be better or
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.920]   I'm going to go to the gym and I'm going to lift weights because it's going to make
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.600]   Me faster when I'm on the football field a sort of isolated abstract practice separate from the actual endeavor in which you want to apply it
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.320]   That is the exception not the rule
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.760]   So yes, we do that in sports. We do that in
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.560]   Music we do that for things like chess, but for most endeavors, especially
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.680]   Complicated cognitive endeavors like almost any skill you'd be improving in knowledge work
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   For most endeavors you're better off having the actual work itself be your practice
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.080]   Instead of saying let me do something
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:50.760]   Different and hope that the skills I pick up in this abstract practice carry over to my specific work
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.040]   Let your work itself be the practice
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.560]   We actually do this and by we
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:05.000]   I'm referring here to the the online course that I have with Scott Young called top performer, which we open up once or twice a year
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.840]   This is a course in which it's based on my book. So good. They can't ignore you
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.280]   We help you do exactly this deliberately practice your job to get better at it
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.400]   So you can take control and we're very specific. We've done this course since
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:21.440]   2014 so we've been doing this course for a while. We've learned to be very specific that to practice
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   The key is to get an active project that your boss knows you're doing that you're being held accountable
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.120]   That matters the outcome matters that is designed
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:38.680]   Very carefully to stretch your skills beyond where you're currently comfortable. Let the actual work itself be your practice session
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.640]   That's going to be your best bet especially with professional training
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.840]   Now this is in part just because the stakes are higher like you actually care about this. I have to do this
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.280]   It's part of my job. I said I'm gonna do this
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.880]   There's consequences if I don't but it also has to do with the actual mechanisms
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   You're practicing specifically the thing you want to be better at as opposed to helping hoping that related skills carry over
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.280]   Right. It's like we hear this sometimes from people. Here's a common example. I hear
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.000]   Should I do?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.680]   meditation or like play a game like chess
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:15.480]   So that I get more comfortable with sustained concentration when I'm doing my work and
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.920]   To that my answer is always the better way to practice
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.440]   Concentrating on your work is to practice
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.880]   Concentrating on your work to actually sit there with a stopwatch schedule out the time
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.160]   We're gonna do 20 minutes at a time until we're comfortable
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.840]   Then we're gonna do 30 minutes if my attention wanders
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   I'm gonna stop the clock and I'm gonna start over like it's better to actually practice
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.000]   Specifically what it feels like to concentrate on specifically what you do for your work
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.240]   Feeling the specific distractions that are unique to your workplace the slack channels the email than it is to do something unrelated and hope
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:55.920]   Concentration skills carry over this carries over for lots of other skills. You want to be a better computer programmer. Don't do Sudoku
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.000]   Give yourself harder computer programming challenges that makes you harder at it. You want to be a better
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.600]   writer
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.280]   Don't do crossword puzzles give yourself increasingly challenging writing assignments for work and really push yourself to meet the bar
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.560]   So almost always that's going to be the right thing to do
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.960]   Use your work itself to practice the key is
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.480]   When finding a work project to double as practice the key is typically two things
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.760]   Stakes slash accountability like it needs to matter
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.240]   Someone's going to see this work if it's bad
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.960]   It's gonna be a problem my boss is waiting for it like you want stakes or accountability and to design the project
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.680]   This is the hard part, but you have to design it to require you
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.360]   To stretch your current abilities beyond where you're currently comfortable to succeed
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.320]   This is why this is hard. Is that it's easy to go too little or too far
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.200]   It's easy to have a project that doesn't really stretch your abilities
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.840]   You're not getting much practice from that or to be way too ambitious
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.440]   Right. So if you're the computer programmer way too easy is like yeah, I'll
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.480]   I'll write the library calls for the UI and it's something you've done all the time
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.040]   You can just do this automatically. You're not getting any better. But on the other hand if you say yeah, I'll go through and
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.440]   I'll rework all the algorithms in a dynamic programming paradigm so that we can you know, cut down our
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   Asymptotic efficiency here by a linear factor and you don't really know much about dynamic programming that you're gonna be in trouble
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.080]   So you got to kind of find that sweet spot of like this is like something I know how to do
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.040]   But I'm pushing it to a higher level
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:35.320]   I've written the first drafts of the client reports, but then someone has edited it now
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.760]   I'm gonna say let me write the full draft, right? So you're pushing yourself not too little not too far
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:47.080]   So yes use your activities to get better. You don't need abstract training when it comes to complex cognitive activities like your job
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.360]   It's hard to believe we're a decade out from so good. They can't ignore you
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   I have a hard time that was like my first real hardcover idea book
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.440]   2012 so it's been
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.520]   More than a decade that books important because it was my first hardcover idea book
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:08.440]   it was I it came out right when I started as a professor right before I had my first kid so like that's such a
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:14.640]   Turning point that kicked off an era that I feel like just ended with
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.200]   Just recently with
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.400]   Getting full professor I'm out of promotions, right? So I started my professorship there. I'm like out of promotions
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.800]   My oldest kids going to middle school next year like leaving elementary school like there's all these things sort of symbolically
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:38.240]   My writing is at a different level and I don't know it's interesting. There's some sort of period here. That's ending
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.040]   All right. Who do we got next a fan just sent a a hard copy
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.680]   Right picture of our old
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.000]   So good. They can't ignore you like a really worn cover. I saw that. Yeah, I've seen a few of these I
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   Wonder if this has to do with the inks or something
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.400]   So, alright, so for people who don't know so good they can't ignore you
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.560]   I don't have a copy in here to show you I think my copy looks okay out there
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.720]   Yeah, but it's a it's like a red orange like a very
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.440]   dominant color
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.860]   Cover, I've seen a lot of covers people bringing them to get signed and a fan sent it to us as well
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.920]   Yeah, super faded
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.960]   When I was up at Dartmouth someone brought me a copy to sign that was like you could barely read it
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.720]   It was like bleep now. He told me he had left it in the back of his car
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.240]   So I got a lot of Sun, but I think there's something about the inks in that cover
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.840]   That it can fade
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   Something about it. So if you have an unfaded so good, they can't ignore your cover. I guess that's extra rare. Nice. I suppose. Yeah
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.640]   Alright next question from Sharma
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.040]   I'm a developer
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:51.560]   Software developer, but I also want to become better writer and reader working on both simultaneously would do too much with my current job
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.720]   Should I focus on reading first?
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.680]   All right. That's a
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.320]   That's a good question. Okay, I think that's fine. I
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:06.960]   Mean, that's fine. All right. So here's the let me can't make this more general the the the issue here is
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.480]   Let's get beyond the specific things to Sharma's trying to get better at
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.240]   she has a few things she wants to get better at and
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.820]   It feels like pursuing them all at the same time would be too much and what I'm saying is that's fine
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.820]   Don't pursue them at the same time
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:26.720]   There's a principle in here that sort of suffuses my new book slow productivity
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.480]   which is this idea of
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.600]   slow, but steady
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.160]   like what you want to avoid is sort of
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:40.840]   Disengagement with your work disengagement with trying to work on something important you want to
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.680]   avoid sort of long periods of
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:50.800]   Full disengagement, but you also want to avoid overload overload is like the one of the central villains of my book
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.280]   It causes a lot of problems. All right, so yeah do one thing at a time
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.520]   Because here's the thing. It's all about timescale
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.680]   If for the next six months you might feel like oh, man
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.360]   I'm only working on in this case reading but not my writing and I really want to be good at my writing
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.440]   I wish I was just better at all of them fast forward to six years
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.760]   Spend some time on your reading spend some time on your writing come back spend a year on your reading spend another year on your
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.640]   Right fast forward six years like oh, wait, I'm good at both of these things
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:23.040]   This is the thing about accomplishment about skill building about endeavors. They aggregate and
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.560]   Over time you aggregate more and more things I can do more things than I could before I know more things than I did before
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.960]   I
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   produced more things than I have before and
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.520]   Overtime and aggregates, right?
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   So think about all this on a larger timescale and you can be easier on yourself in the shorter timescale
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.140]   Back in the day. I used to write about this when I was just dealing with students
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.200]   I had this phrase for this the paradox of the relaxed Road Scholar
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:54.840]   This is of course a much more compressed time frame example, but even among college students. There is this phenomenon
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.320]   where if you would look at the resumes of
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.200]   national or international scholarship winners
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:08.760]   They seemed sort of impossibly full and I know about this because my very first book how to win at college the whole premise of that
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.080]   Book is that I interviewed international national scholarship winners
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.800]   I interviewed
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.960]   Road scholars and Marshall scholars and Goldberg scholars and a few others and they were the source of the wisdom for how to win at
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.160]   College, right? So I really got to know these resumes
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.240]   Students would often be intimidated
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.000]   They'd read the resume of a Road Scholar and said they did this and they did this and they did that
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.760]   I couldn't imagine doing all three of those things
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.080]   But if you talk to the actual Road Scholars, they'd like well, I didn't do them at once
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   I did this and then I did that and then I did this other thing
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.520]   And then when we zoom out and look back we say oh my god, you did all these things
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:47.640]   I get this in my own life, right because I have this book out about slow productivity and sometimes interviewers will say well
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.120]   Wait a second, but you do this and you do that and you do this that feels like it would be very busy. How can you
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.600]   Fulfill your first principle of the book to do fewer things
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.920]   If like you're writing books and you're doing this and you're doing that and it seems like you would be very busy
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.160]   What I often say is yeah, but I don't do those things at the same time. I'm very seasonal
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.280]   Right, if I'm writing a book, I'm not doing other things if I'm working on a lot of academic ideas
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.960]   I'm not doing other things if I'm promoting a book. I'm not writing a book or working on academic ideas
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.480]   Everything has its season. I feel like I work at a pretty slow pace in the moment
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.000]   But when you fast-forward out and said what happens between as we just talked about so good
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.080]   They can't ignore you in 2012 and slow productivity in
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.480]   2024 a lot happened, but I didn't do all of that stuff at the same time. So there's there's a power here
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   too slow, but steady
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.880]   Relentless, but reasonable that pacing over time is incredibly powerful. It's like compound interest with money
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.680]   It's boring this month, but you fast-forward to 10 years and you have a lot more money in your account. It's the same thing
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   slowly, but steady
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:58.800]   Relentlessly, but reasonably you keep making progress on things you don't have long down periods, but you also don't overload yourself
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.400]   That's where that's kind of the sweet spot. I think for where things really things really stack up
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.560]   All right, who'd we got next next questions from JJ?
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.880]   What are your tips for the grind part of studying like getting through massive amounts of practice problems and flashcards?
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:19.460]   It feels like more like slogging than flowing. I fall behind even if I take one or two days off
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:25.080]   Well, we got first of all a correction to make here be very careful in how you think about flow
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.000]   and
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.680]   This was something I got into
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.040]   With my interview with Andrew Huberman and I think this particular discussion sort of made the rounds because I think it's an important one
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   Is that I think we?
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.200]   Over generalize or over apply flow as a desirable goal
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.300]   All right. So let's be you know, we can set a little bit of context here. What do we mean by flow?
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.920]   Flow is a specific psychological state
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:55.080]   The name was coined and the phenomenon was primarily studied by the late psychologist. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.520]   The idea about flow is when you're in this state
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.120]   You lose track of time you get lost in what you're doing. It feels almost effortless
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.240]   so it's really important and he wrote a cool book about flow and
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.660]   When we get in when we don't get it and it's a very real state and it's a very nice state
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.760]   Here's the problem about flow
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   It's hard to get into and there's a lot of things we do that are cognitively important that
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.100]   Will not generate flow and we can't expect him to generate flow
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.360]   So I think there was this over generalization. Not my Haley was not saying this but there's been this over
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.840]   Generalization of this concept where people feel as if this is the goal of all cognitive work to get in the flow
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.560]   It is very nice. But there's a lot of stuff you can't get in the flow. So what is one of the
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.520]   distinct
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.760]   Cognitive activities that is resistant to flow
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:51.400]   Deliberate practice so deliberate practice now. This is named for also now the late
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:58.120]   Performance psychologist Anders Erikson deliberate practice is our best understanding about how people get better at
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.280]   Complicated tasks be them physical or cognitive
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:09.520]   It requires you to have a clear target the stretch yourself past where you're comfortable to have clear feedback to make sure that you're directing
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.400]   Your actions in sort of like the correct way
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.760]   This is how you stretch
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.480]   Be it a muscle memory or an actual cognitive concept how you stretch and get smarter how you get better at a particular physical
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.120]   activity
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.480]   Anders Erikson was very clear about this. He knew my Haley and you know, I had the privilege of actually talking with both of them
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.800]   too before
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.560]   Before they pass I've sort of talked to both of them about this as well
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.320]   Anders was very clear deliberate practice is different than flow
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.760]   In fact deliberate practice is the opposite of flow in the sense of you don't lose track of time when you're deliberately
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   Practicing you feel every you feel every minute. It's really hard. You're stretching yourself past where you're comfortable
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.400]   That's a really hard thing to do and it requires sustained
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.760]   Intentional concentration on what you're doing is often not pleasant. You don't get lost in it
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   it turns out like a better way to
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:03.280]   Understand the distinction between deliberate practice and flow is to think about preparation and performance because they often fall along those lines
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.800]   In my book so good. They can't ignore you
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:13.560]   For example, I spent time and I tell the story in the book sitting there with a professional guitar player named Jordan watching him practice
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.960]   and it was
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.760]   almost excruciating
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:23.680]   like he was so focused on speeding up the speed of the lick that he would forget to breathe and then he would have these
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   Sudden intakes of breath the sharp gas because his body was thinking we need oxygen because that's how focused he was on trying to
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.920]   Get the speed faster on what he's doing. That's deliberate practice. He's not lost in what he's doing there
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.280]   He's every minute is requiring intentional focus
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.160]   But when that same guitar player got on stage to play and he played at our wedding
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.080]   And that same guitar player would get on stage to play and perform what he had practiced these hard one skills
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   Then he could get lost in what he's doing
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.360]   Then he could get into a state of flow
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.920]   So deliberate practice is different than flow. Alright, so here's the bad news JJ
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.720]   Learning new things like you're doing as you talked about here studying from flashcards
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.280]   That's deliberate practice world
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.040]   That's you trying to rinse your brain into a new understanding of something
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.520]   It didn't understand before you are not going to get lost in a flow state learning flashcards
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.640]   Alright, what can we do about this?
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.360]   Well, here's how I used to approach this type of work and this is relevant beyond academic work as well for anything that sort of
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.240]   Deliberate and tedious at the same time, right? So a couple things that matter
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.720]   One you need to control your time as a student, right?
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.600]   This is how I'm going to study for this test
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:41.640]   I used to recommend that you would in the beginning of your semester find all your major exams put them on your calendar and
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.960]   Then mark on your calendar way in advance when you were going to create your study plan for that exam
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.600]   And I would say do this three weeks in advance and when you get to that day you would see it on your calendar
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.400]   And you're laying out the whole thing putting that time on your calendar. I have three weeks to prepare for this exam
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.480]   I'm not waiting until hey, what's due tomorrow? Oh my god. I have an exam tomorrow
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.920]   Let me try to learn all this stuff
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:07.880]   You're giving yourself time to spread this out when you spread this out. You can be very strategic about the deliberate practice demanding grind behaviors
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:15.400]   Like memorizing things from flashcards, you can make those sessions short. You can make them intense. Let me get in 30 minutes here 30 minutes there
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   I'm gonna spread this out over a week or two
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.520]   So that it's much more reasonable than trying to sit down and do it all at once where your brains probably gonna cry uncle at
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   Some point you're gonna have to give up. I
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:32.520]   Also then recommend for the actual activity of learning things from flashcards to make sure that you're doing successive refinement now all these ideas
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.600]   I'm talking about are actually in my book how to become a straight-a student, but I'll just give you the the cliff notes here
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.680]   The successive refinement is very simple, but it makes a big difference what you want to do
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.680]   If you're going through a stack of flashcards
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.760]   Create two piles
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   Got it, right got it wrong
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.240]   Then when you do your next pass just use the pile that you got wrong again
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.560]   What did I get right? What did I get wrong? So you're successively reducing?
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.280]   You're refining the things you're looking at to only be the things that up to this point. You've still gotten wrong
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.040]   It's a very efficient way to go through flashcards because it ensures that the things, you know
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.080]   Get a minimum of time. I saw it once I knew it
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.000]   I don't want to look at it again the things you're having the most trouble with you're gonna be seen again and again and again
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.600]   It's a much more efficient allocation of your deliberate practice concentration than going through the whole stack again and again
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   I was an art history minor little-known fact about me. That's a lot of memorization
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.560]   Artist names dates of work you had to memorize that for just hundreds and hundreds of paintings
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   And this is how this is how I would do it
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   Alright, so our general point here deliberate practice is different than flow
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.600]   So you want to be structured and organized you want to schedule this time in advance?
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:45.320]   You want to keep the time reasonable and then more specifically you want to do successive refinement during these sort of grind flashcard session
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.420]   So they don't they don't become too overburdened some
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.040]   All right, what do we got next? All right next questions from Denny
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.600]   I have a fledgling YouTube channel in the real estate area. You talk a lot about building your craft
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   I specifically want to build my craft making YouTube videos. How should I do that?
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.440]   Well, look, here's my first question. Be sure you really do want to do that
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.280]   Right YouTube is an interesting beast
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:18.040]   It's different. I would say it's different than other even social media products, right? So if you have a business and you're thinking
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.520]   Look, I want to have a social media presence. I have a presence on Instagram
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:27.200]   It kind of helps I can have this audience and it's like people subscribe to it and they can see the things I'm doing
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   And maybe it helps us get a couple more
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.600]   Customers or these videos we're doing about like what's happening with the house prices might get sold
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.720]   YouTube is even more brutal than that, right because you can have as a
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.400]   As a real estate, I guess you're probably like a real estate agent or something
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.280]   You can have like an Instagram account
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.200]   That the people who follow it they're coming to follow it. They sort of know you people are used to this
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.000]   There's an interpersonal aspect as social media. I live in the same town
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.640]   I I was looking for houses in this town and I found this there's more of this regionalization the social localization
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.180]   You can have like a nice size audience
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.220]   That's actually like maybe a reasonable audience and some good stuff might come out of it
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   YouTube is way more winner-take-all
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:16.800]   Right. We don't have that same habit of there's someone like in my town that has a YouTube channel
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.200]   I'm gonna go subscribe and watch their videos in the way that like with social media we might
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.120]   Right. So then what happens with YouTube?
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:29.900]   It's algorithmic driven curation, which means your videos will be watched by approximately nobody
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:36.520]   unless you can have all of the pieces that have to be in place to play well with the audience and algorithm and
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:42.360]   Then an audience can build but it's unclear even what that audience will be. Even if you want them. It's a very complicated world
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:49.560]   So here's what you would have to do. First of all, let's talk about the actual content itself. It has to be super compelling
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:56.160]   because it has to be something that makes someone say I'm gonna sit here and keep watching this video if they don't do that the
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:02.240]   Algorithm is gonna say goodbye. It doesn't matter what you do, right? So it has to be very compelling which means either
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.260]   You have to you have to promise something really big up front and really deliver it
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:13.240]   Or the content itself has to be really unique and deep and something that you're you're well-suited to deliver
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.960]   The delivery itself has to be just right you have sort of like two options for YouTube delivery
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.400]   Either you have to do the YouTube editing style like you would see personified in a mr
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.040]   beast video where it's cut every 10 to 12 seconds so that like it moves moves moves moves moves and the viewer is
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.640]   Never has that moment of boredom in which they'll leave it or you have to be a professional talker
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.920]   Right, so you can do what like Andrew Huberman does or I do but we're professional talkers, right?
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:42.560]   And we're coming from a place of authority. I've been you know, the public eye writing for a long time
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.280]   I've sold millions of books. I you know, I can speak for a long period of time
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.320]   You're either a professional talker. You have to do that YouTube editing, right?
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.560]   These are all just table stakes then you got to get all the details, right?
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:59.120]   You know like one of the things we have a YouTube guy who does our thumbnails and does our headlines
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.600]   I've gotten a little bit more involved in the headlines
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.920]   I was like, I want to make these a little bit more accurate a little bit less YouTube II
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.880]   That these little tweaks that's 10,000 views gone right away
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:15.560]   Like these little things matter a huge amount and if any of these things aren't done, right like nothing works
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.200]   So I don't want to scare you away from this. I just don't want you to waste your time
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.440]   Like if you have a play here, I have a super unique super compelling thing to do
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.880]   I can make these videos super compelling
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:32.200]   but like an audience feels like they have to keep watching and I'm willing to do all the right work with the thumbnails and the
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.760]   Headlines that this could grow but then even then you have to say is the audience that it's going to grow going to be useful
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.200]   For what I'm doing
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.480]   This is different than other social media where you can build a more localized regionalized audience. I think it gets more directly to
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.360]   The you know, hey, I want people in this town
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:53.200]   To encounter me and you know, we're giving the housing report for this neighborhood like that can work on Instagram
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.480]   It's not gonna work as well on YouTube. I don't know what Jesse is that you've been seeing the other end of this
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.760]   It might be a little bit too pessimistic or no, I agree with you. Yeah, it's pretty brutal. Yeah. Yeah
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   I think for us what we like is
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.200]   It's there's a segment of audience that I want this to get to that. I don't think we're reaching with the audio
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.320]   It's like we have a very specific reason
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   There's a sort of a younger band of an audience
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.640]   That we can we can get to with YouTube and then we have the secondary reason that I do think video is going to be
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.800]   Critical for shows like this in the future. I don't think through YouTube necessarily but video delivery is going to be critical
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.240]   And so we want to make sure we're good at it
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.360]   So sort of like when the time comes like oh, here's this network this app this video network
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.480]   Whatever, however this unfolds we want to make sure that we're good at it
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:41.180]   But if I just had a small business and I really want to be online, I would look at other social media before YouTube
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:48.760]   All right. Who do we got next? We have our corner slow productivity corner. Here we go. Let's hear some music
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   So
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:51:03.680]   Daniel has to say you have mentioned something to the effect that after getting tenor and after your kids were in school
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.760]   It became more relevant to think about getting setting a sustainable pace for your work
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:13.200]   I am just starting as an assistant professorship at an r1 institution and have a 16 month year old
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:20.880]   Can you comment on the mindset you applied to productivity as an assistant professor and how it relates to and differs from the slow productivity mindset?
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.140]   All right. Good question for those who don't know the slow productivity corner is the one question per episode that we think is
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:32.660]   Directly connected to my new book slow productivity, which you should check out if you haven't seen it
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.000]   alright, so what Daniel is referring to so he's a
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.520]   Let me decode everything briefly for the audience
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:45.400]   Assistant professorship at r1 institution in the US system r1 institution means you're it's a Carnegie ranking
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.200]   But it basically means categorization, but it means you're a research institution. So it's a professorship
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.900]   If you have a professorship at an r1 University
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:59.080]   It's you're expected to produce a lot of research research will be the foundation on which ten-year decisions will be made
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:05.480]   Assistance professorship is the first level of professorship in the American system. So when you start as a professor, you're an assistant professor
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:13.200]   Typically associate professor is the promotion you get along with 10-year and then later there's full professorship
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   Okay, and I've talked about how like this stage of my life. I'm in the third stage as a professor
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:25.280]   There's my assistant professor stage. There's my post 10-year associate professor stage. And now I've just entered the full professor stage
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:32.040]   as Daniel pointed out when I was an assistant professor, I had a lot of young young kids was sort of the
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.360]   What was going on right because my I think I there's babies around for like all of my assistant professorship
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.360]   I became an assistant professor in
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:47.560]   2012 that fall my first kid was born. My second kid was born in
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.400]   2014
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:55.000]   And then I got tenure in 2016. So I always had someone within two years of birth
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.520]   All right. So here's the things I did differently in that period Daniel as compared to now or other times
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.560]   One I was certainly very careful about time block planning and fixed schedule productivity meaning
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.640]   These are the hours I have to work
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.000]   I have to make the most of them right because the the child care schedule made anything else impossible
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.800]   We were working
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.680]   With a nanny at that period so there's a lot of like hey, you gotta be home at this time
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.000]   This is when the nanny has to go home
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.480]   Right, like you can't be working at this time because the nanny won't be there yet
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:36.960]   And you know your your wife has to go early here. And so the schedule was everything and limited hours
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.040]   I had to make the most of those hours
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.360]   So this was I was really big on time block planning like really thinking through what do I want to do with each day?
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:49.400]   To get the most out of it. The other thing I did during the young kid early tenure period is I simplified
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   I was like, okay
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   professional goal one two and three
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:59.440]   Papers published in good venues to get a lot of citations. That's everything for tenure, right?
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:05.840]   Confidential letter writers from the field evaluating your research productivity. That's what I focused on
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:12.280]   To the exclusion of almost everything else. I wasn't launching a lot of other endeavors a lot of other ideas
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:18.480]   I wasn't starting initiatives on campus like the type of things I'm involved in now with digital ethics and starting new programs and none of that
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.920]   super focused
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.600]   This is why I had strict quotas on academic service
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.120]   Only this many program committees and this many peer reviews will I do per semester because I had the focus on research above all else
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:38.200]   You definitely see this in my general audience book writing. So I had a book come out in 2012 right before my first kid was born
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.640]   That whole assistant professor period
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.440]   Four or five years. I published one book
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.720]   the deep work
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.440]   So you could there's this year the first two years of my first kids life
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:55.560]   I did zero writing altogether because I was like I've got to take care of this kid and I got to publish papers and then
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.560]   I slowly wrote one book
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.800]   During that period and that's it
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.480]   Right, so I deeply simplified during that period
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.720]   Post ten year and as my kids got a little bit older this sort of began to get some breathing room
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.000]   I wasn't on the treadmill of like I if I don't get this many papers
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.820]   I'm not gonna get ten year and things do change Daniel, but I think that's a good way to think about it
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:20.400]   Be very careful about your time. Here's the hours. I have to work. I want to make the most of them
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:26.560]   Be very protective about your time what you agree to do keep first things first, which is publishing papers that matter
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.220]   Low profile just publishing is what matters keep your life simple
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:37.000]   Just when you're working make that what you're working on as much as possible be very effective efficient with your time during work
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.200]   And if you do that, then it works out, but I'm not working. I'm not working and I'm you know
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.040]   Taking care of kids and all the other stuff that comes with that period it can work out
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:51.000]   But you got to focus you got to simplify you got to take care of your time as carefully as possible
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.040]   I'll tell you when it's all going to go down the drain is when that kid well 16 month old
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.000]   Yeah, once they start going to preschool because then you're gonna be sick half the year
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.280]   But that's a you'll see that soon enough Daniel learn how to work when you have a cold
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.880]   All right. Let's let's do a quick case study here
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.760]   This comes from M
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.040]   M says
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.560]   Professionally, I use your ideas to plan my next career move within my organization in the foreign service
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.800]   We rotate assignments every two to three years and I had a feeling a bit burnt
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:27.840]   Oh, I had been feeling a bit burnt out with my current position and not motivated to start looking for my next job
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.980]   Using your lifestyle centric planning. I set criteria for the type of positions. I would target
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:38.800]   I wanted to move back to DC and avoid positions involving emergency or after-hours duties
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   I had accepted that this could be a career detour and not great for my promotion
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.640]   But to my surprise, I found many intriguing positions that matched my criteria last month
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:53.120]   I happily accepted an offer at the State Department's Diplomatic Training Institute. I'll be leading a medium-sized team
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:58.640]   So it'll still be a substantive role, but it offers an element of seasonality flexibility and hopefully no after-hours
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   Emergency. All right, so we get a good example there of lifestyle centric planning
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.600]   We talked about this last week in last week's deep dive
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.320]   You're not going to build a deep meaningful intentional life just by pursuing a singular grand goal
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.940]   That'll fix all your problems. You got to figure out directly. What are all the elements of the lifestyle?
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:24.720]   I want and then flexibly think about all of your options for taking advantage of opportunities and avoiding obstacles to move closer to that vision
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.200]   It's not as sexy as saying I have this big goal that will fix everything
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.840]   But by looking directly and identifying directly
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.400]   These are the parts of my life and what I want them to be like you come across really interesting solutions
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.520]   That make your day-to-day existence more meaningful and intentional. So that is a great example
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:48.400]   All right, we got a cool final segment coming up. But first briefly, I want to hear share a word from another one of our sponsors
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.720]   particular I want to talk about our longtime friends at
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.400]   Blinkist an app that gives you over
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:03.000]   500 book summaries and expert-led audio guides to read or listen to they each take just about 15 minutes to
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.760]   Consume you can get best-in-class actual knowledge from over 27 categories such as productivity psychology and more
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.040]   I just checked out the blink for my latest book slow productivity and it was quite good
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:22.100]   The way Jesse and I use Blinkist is as a triage tool for our reading life for interested in a book
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:28.280]   We'll listen to or read the blink first before deciding whether or not to buy and read the full book. This works out really well
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:34.040]   Right. Sometimes it immediately tells you oh, this is not what I thought. I'm glad I didn't buy it other times
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.440]   It's like okay. This is an interesting idea, but I don't need to read a whole book on it
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.040]   I'm glad I know it and sometimes you say oh my god. I can't wait to read this
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.120]   So it's a fantastic way to use it other people
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.200]   I know use it to try to quickly get the lay of the land of interesting topic areas
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:54.360]   Hey, let me listen to or read the blinks for five related books. You do that. You're gonna know the main vocabularies and thinkers
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.340]   So anyways, if you're a big reader and all listeners of this podcast should be
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.800]   Blinkist is like the sidekick that you need

[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:43.020]   Also want to talk about our my longtime friend Adam Gilbert and his company my body tutor. I
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.680]   Think this is such a fantastic idea. Let's say you want to get more healthy
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:52.580]   The hard part is not necessarily the information you want to eat better. You want to exercise the hard part is consistency
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.740]   Making the right decisions doing the work again. And again, this is where my body tutor enters the scene
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:05.380]   It's a 100% online coaching program. So what happens here is you are assigned a coach
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   That works directly with you to figure out what you're going to do with nutrition and what you're gonna do with exercise and then and here's
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.360]   the key
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.440]   You check in virtually with this coach every day
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:20.120]   That's accountability is what gives you the consistency. It also gives you
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.720]   Customization. Oh, I'm going on vacation. What should I do?
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.400]   I worry about like not having my normal food or access to the gym your coach is like let's make a plan for this
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.520]   Let's work together to figure out how to adjust things for exactly your circumstance
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.480]   So you customize your approach to the good health while having a coach to keep you accountable
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.440]   this is where the consistency comes from and because it's a hundred percent online you get that consistency without the
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   Grand expense of having a chef and a trainer come to your house every day. Like you're a Marvel superhero in training
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:56.880]   So my body tutor is the simple effective smart way to get healthy if you're thinking I want to be healthier than I am
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.840]   This is the way you do it. You go to my body tutor calm
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.580]   That's t-u-t-o-r my body tutor calm when you sign up tell them that deep
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.520]   Questions sent you and they will give you $50 off your first month
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.960]   All right. Let's move on to our final segment. I
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:19.760]   Will just bring this down to our final segment where I typically like to react to something. I
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:28.320]   Have encountered over the internet in the past week now this week instead of reacting to a specific article or a specific
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.120]   clip
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.760]   I'm going to react to a particular internet
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.000]   figure and
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.920]   Spoiler alert there is going to be an apology for me at the end of this reaction
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.560]   All right. So who's the figure I want to talk about the youtuber James Scholl's
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.480]   S-c-h-o-l
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.440]   Z now, let me give you a little bit of background on how my path has
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.760]   Intersected with that of James Soules since I chose since I talked a lot about
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:06.200]   Productivity typically in the context of trying to push back against digital distraction, but I talk about productivity
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:12.120]   I have a book out that has productivity in the title. I'm often asked in interviews about hustle culture and
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.520]   The dangers of hustle culture. So this seems to be this this big
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.920]   Concern is that everyone is subscribed to hustle culture and this is a bad thing
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.400]   Now I often got a little bit confused about this, right?
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.120]   Because what would happen is someone would read something like Oliver Berkman's fantastic book 4,000 weeks
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.940]   Which is about life being short and there's only so much you can get done and it's really good meaningful pragmatic philosophical reflections
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:41.880]   but they'll read something like 4,000 weeks and they'll say finally a
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:48.680]   Book that's pushing back against hustle culture and this idea that you can get everything done and you should do more
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.720]   Finally and I would always be confused because I said look I've been a professional book writer for the last 20 years
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.120]   Where are these books that are saying something different?
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.720]   What are the what are the best-selling?
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.640]   productivity books quote-unquote of the
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.640]   2010s it's
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.720]   essentialism
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:14.600]   About doing fewer things. It's a deep work about doing fewer things. It's one thing right about doing fewer things
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:21.680]   It's it's Oliver's book itself 4,000 weeks go back to the 2000s you get Tim Ferriss. How do we stop working so much?
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.520]   How do we work less? How do we have more vacations?
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.080]   We get David Allen's getting things done, which is not about getting more things done
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.040]   But trying to survive the onslaught of work so that at least you can find some peace
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.960]   It's the opposite of a call to get things done. So I would always say I don't know what this hustle culture is where it is
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.100]   That we're so afraid of so then people would say what's online
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.260]   It's like okay. I don't know the online world as much. I don't use social media
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.880]   I'm not a big person. I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.920]   My podcast if you're watching it now is produced put on YouTube, but I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.880]   It's like okay, maybe there's this hustle culture out there on
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.400]   Line and that's what people are talking about
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:08.600]   And this is where I first heard the example of James Scholes because in the first year of the pandemic what James did famously
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.560]   Was basically every day for a year
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.720]   would record himself a live stream himself studying
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.760]   Not for 20 minutes not for an hour, but often 10 11 12 hours at a time
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.840]   He's just sitting there in his apartment
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:28.600]   Studying usually Pomodoro style 50 minutes on 10 minutes off or hour on 10 minutes off
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.740]   He'd do a little bit of narration the breaks, but it's really just him
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:33.440]   just studying
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.680]   People would tune in they would study with them and you can still see all these videos on the James Scholes his
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.560]   original
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.080]   YouTube channel
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.280]   And so I was like, okay
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:42.440]   Yeah
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.740]   maybe that's that's our good example of hustle culture like the guy that like studies for 12 hours at a time because look I wrote some
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.800]   Books about how to study when I was young and the right way to study is the opposite of studying for 12 hours at a
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.960]   Time that's that's just gonna burn you out. I was like that maybe that's hustle culture. I just sort of used James as a
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.280]   Canonical example of like yeah online there's this hustle culture thing
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.320]   But those of us who are writing books about it and we're thinking about this more
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.500]   Expansively, I wasn't the only one to make those connections. I'm gonna read a couple quotes here from an article from 2022
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:18.000]   About James, I won't link to the article because I don't like the non-famous writers
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.800]   I don't like to throw under the bus, but let me just read some quotes from this article about James
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.480]   it talks about
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.280]   Watching a lot of James then getting disillusioned. So the article says
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.440]   Yet another part of me felt disappointed that this had become my measurement of time
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:40.080]   Well spent ceaseless hours in a brightly lit room staring at a screen whilst listening to YouTube videos boredom
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:47.000]   Begin to feel like the culmination of many things that had been brewing in my mind about productivity the hustle and what it all meant
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.240]   This article goes on to say lots of nice things about Oliver Berkman
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.480]   Let me see. I have a couple other quotes. I want to read from towards the end
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:02.480]   Productivity gives the false impression that we can do everything we want. We can become an all-conquering person never again subcoming to the limitedness
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:10.520]   Limitedness that time imposes upon you but this is simply not right the day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:16.780]   Berkman writes later. This author says having everything under control is the glistening of the productivity diamond
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:21.200]   We're constantly attempting to master time to channel ourselves into a position of dominance and control
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.920]   Over unfolding lives so that we might finally feel safe and secure and no longer so vulnerable to events
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.800]   Protection from vulnerability is now learning but impossible
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.080]   state
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.680]   So James Schultz represents this hustle culture that has an unobtainable
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.660]   Belief of like what's possible through productivity? Okay
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:48.560]   Here's the thing. I recently went down more of a rabbit hole on James. I listened to some interviews with him
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.240]   and listen to him talk about
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.680]   himself and why he did these videos and
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:00.320]   I no longer think it is correct to make him the patron saint of hustle culture. I
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:06.240]   Don't think that's what he's doing at all. Let's look back to this discussion of hustle culture again from this article
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.320]   What are the properties they point out about hustle culture?
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.480]   It's about the impression. You can get everything you want. You can be all-conquering
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.200]   You'll never succumb to the limitlessness of time that you can have everything under control
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.120]   You're caught you can master your times. You can channel yourself to a position of dominance. Where is that in?
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:29.640]   The quiet video of James Schultz just sitting there studying all day long
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.840]   Where is he talking about you can get everything done? Where is he talking about you can have full control over your life?
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:40.240]   Where is he saying you can get into a position of dominance and I will show you how he barely talks
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.040]   He just sits there and he quietly studies
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.880]   So what is really going on with James Schultz? Well as becomes clear if you listen to some interviews with him
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.340]   He is not promoting to people that
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.280]   What he is doing this extreme is somehow
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:00.480]   Something that everyone else should be doing that people should be studying for 12 hours. Trust me
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.440]   I wrote books about studying you don't have enough stuff to study for 12 hours
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.920]   I don't know what he was studying for 12 hours. That was not the goal of these videos. They had two purposes
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.160]   One small one big the small purpose was to be live
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.800]   This was early pandemic
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.360]   Many places were in current lockdowns
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.380]   Right, so people were stuck at home and in particular students were stuck at home learning online
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.640]   So he was offering this idea that whenever it was you happen to be studying
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.840]   You could go and this live stream was probably going on and you wouldn't feel alone
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.760]   It's not a video that someone recorded before of studying
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.960]   He would be studying when you needed to study other people would be watching him
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.160]   You could see how many people are watching them. It was creating a sense of digital community
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:47.040]   So why was he studying 12 hours to make sure he covered as much of the day as possible?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.440]   so as many people as possible who we're gonna study for an hour that day would have a chance of
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:58.600]   Being able to intersect with this ongoing live stream. I think that was the small reason right not you should study 12 hours
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.900]   But to make sure whatever hour you do study, there's a good chance. My live stream will be going on
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.480]   The bigger version here though is I think this is an exemplar of something we've seen in other areas of well
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.060]   We could call it these sort of monastic prototype
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.560]   where there's a there's an issue that's afflicting a
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.360]   population and the monastic
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.880]   Right the monastic of this example
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.360]   Goes in in a very public and showy way does the opposite to an extreme
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.640]   not because the monastic thinks that the whole population should have an aesthetic lifestyle and
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.040]   Move to the caves and meditate under the tree all day
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.800]   But to make the point clear
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.600]   That what they are doing is hurting them and there's power in the opposite, right? So the monastic
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:51.280]   Removes themselves from everyday life and does things to an extreme so those who are still in everyday life can find and draw inspiration. I
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.640]   Think this is another big part of what James Schultz is doing again. He's talking to other young people
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.520]   He was young when he did this he was aiming these videos largely at students
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:08.400]   They were finding their lives overcome with distraction procrastination. They were stuck at home. They're on their phones all the time and
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.160]   It was a dark and bleak
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.880]   Sort of soul-sapping existence
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.800]   I saw this among my own students at Georgetown is that first year the pandemic wound on is that you could see the light going?
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.240]   Out of their eyes. They're just stuck at home. And so he went hard the other way. I'm not gonna look at my phone
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.820]   I'm gonna use retro equipment. He had these old-fashioned computers retro equipment
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.240]   And I'm just gonna sit here and concentrate for hours all day long and in doing so I'm going to sort of make the point
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   That there's power in the opposite of what you're doing
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:40.240]   So there's power in the opposite of staring at a screen and being lost in an algorithmic rabbit hole. It was a monastic behavior
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.400]   we see this play out a lot in the Internet age the Internet age has
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.160]   Made this type of monastic behavior this inspiring monastic behavior more common another example
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.080]   Internet age example David Goggins
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.280]   Right. David Goggins is a character that for those who don't understand
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.640]   What he's responding to he's mystifying right Goggins has this very hard upbringing
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.200]   Really hard troubled childhood
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:15.840]   Grows up a little bit out of shape right going nowhere and gets his act together eventually becomes a Navy SEAL right getting after it Navy SEAL
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.760]   leaves Navy SEALs and starts doing in a sort of
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.840]   documented online sort of way just extreme feats of
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.600]   endurance athletics
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.440]   Extreme feet ultra marathons running every day
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.600]   He got the record for most pull-ups in a 24-hour period these type of things
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:40.760]   He started making these videos and then this would spread he began becoming a guest on a lot of
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.080]   Podcasts that has sort of male audiences where he was just saying, you know, hey get hard be disciplined. Just do it
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.560]   You got to get out there. Just do hard work
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.200]   He's puzzling to a lot of people like this guy's crazy
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.880]   Like he is a little bit crazy. I'm just like obsessive doing the physical activity all day long
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.680]   To like the point of almost nothing else his knees had been completely destroyed like his body is probably falling apart
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.480]   Like what's the point of this? We're not gonna no one's gonna go and do this
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:11.880]   I'm not gonna run a hundred miles like twice a week. I'm not going to you know, do a thousand pull-ups
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.640]   I'm not going to just run around and curse and say get hard like I have a family do other sorts of things
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:22.680]   But that was not the port-a-goggins. He was monastic. He was responding to there was a subset of sort of American Western male culture
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.520]   That was feeling
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:30.080]   Unengaged was feeling on efficacious was feeling sort of out of shape and useless. They were drinking too much
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:38.720]   They were out eating too bad food. They weren't being good fathers. They weren't being good husbands, but they were sort of lacking discipline and
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.360]   So seeing this extreme monastic aesthetic example of discipline was inspiring for that subset of guys
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.160]   It confused everyone else but for them they didn't go off and do the same elite
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:54.480]   Endurance athletic events, but they got in better shape. They got their finances under control. They became better fathers
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.640]   They cared more about their kids and their family. They stopped drinking right? It really turned a lot of lives around
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.440]   So when you do this sort of extreme example of something that's in reaction to a problem
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.840]   It really helps other people leave the problem. That's all I think is going on with James Schultz. It's just for a younger audience
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.560]   So I think I was wrong. I think others are wrong to label him as a paragon of hustle culture is really the opposite
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.840]   He is actually a prophet or saint or monastic in the digital era
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:26.800]   From the young generation speaking to the young generation. Don't be lost in your phones all day
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:34.280]   There be dragons and I'm going to sit outside decay for hours at a time. So you learn how to resist it
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.220]   So that's an apology at James Schultz. He's a much more rich interesting cultural
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:41.920]   Character and I think we made him out to be
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.360]   So I'm still searching. I'm still searching for the core of hustle culture. I need another example now
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:55.440]   Again, it really does feel like almost everyone I talked to even people who are really in this world of productivity
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.860]   They want to be organized but typically because they don't like the stress of being disorganized
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.620]   They're often worried about doing too many things
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:08.440]   They want to be good at what they do, you know, but we're the the group out there. That's really pushing
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.380]   I have the hack that's going to allow you to conquer everything in the world
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:18.700]   That group wherever they are needs to be louder because I'm not running into them a lot and I think that's a good thing
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:24.300]   But anyways James, I think what you did was cool and interesting and as much performance art as it was anything else
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.380]   And so, you know my hat actually now is tipped to you
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:31.520]   All right. That's all the time we have for today. Thank you for tuning in
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.280]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show and until then as always
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.340]   Stay deep. Hey, if you like today's episodes about Jerry Seinfeld's advice for living a deeper life
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:49.100]   I think you'll like last week's episode episode 303 where I talk about the danger of trying to use
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:56.260]   Grand goals to find depth spoiler alert. It doesn't work. Take Jerry's advice instead. Check it out
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.780]   I think you'll enjoy it. How do you create a
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:07.460]   Deep life a life that is lived on purpose a life that the people who know you find to be in a quite
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.020]   literal sense
