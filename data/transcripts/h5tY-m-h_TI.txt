[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.520]   Okay, well it's great to see so many people
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.640]   still hanging in here Sunday morning.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.800]   I wanna give a special shout out
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   to all of our first time Boglehead attendees.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.160]   It's been so exciting to talk to so many of you
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.080]   over the last two days.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.560]   I think the first timers, like all the rest of us,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   probably will go home feeling, I hope,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.320]   that a lot of your core Boglehead principles
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.920]   have been reaffirmed and probably, hopefully,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   there are some things that you've been prompted
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.920]   to think about or question that maybe you hadn't focused on
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.800]   and probably a to-do list.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.980]   I definitely have a to-do list.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760]   So I hope it's been a great experience for you.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.600]   For this panel, we have another wonderful panel.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   I'm proud to have Christine Benz and Mike Piper
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.360]   and John Luskin to serve with them
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.300]   on the board of the Bogle Center.
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.600]   We're thrilled to have Carolyn McClanahan here
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.320]   for her first Bogleheads Conference
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080]   and a special welcome to Harry Sitt,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.380]   who is here for his first Bogleheads Conference.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.380]   Harry runs the popular blog, The Finance Buff.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380]   He has written two books.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.260]   He's been a speaker to our San Jose
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.680]   and Sacramento Bogleheads Chapters.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.620]   As at the other session, so just going
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.460]   from your left to right, Mike Piper,
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.320]   Carolyn McClanahan, Christine Benz,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.500]   Harry Sitt, and John Luskin.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   (audience applauds)
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.820]   As at our other sessions, we'll encourage you
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.860]   to put questions on cards.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.980]   Alan Roth will be going around at some point.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.700]   He's in the back.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.180]   So we'd love to have your questions.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.420]   So we're gonna talk about a variety
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.260]   of financial planning topics in this session,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.860]   including planning for retirement.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.660]   We'll talk some about lessons
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.720]   from Christine's wonderful new book, How to Retire.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.620]   Before we get there, Carolyn, I wanna ask you
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.020]   about something you had said in preparing for this panel.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.180]   You said you would, quote, "Love to talk about
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.100]   "how we need to quit this unhealthy focus on retirement."
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.300]   What do you mean by that?
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.380]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.020]   You know, retirement was invented in the 1930s
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.980]   when Social Security came into being.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.700]   They picked the age of 65 for retirement.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.620]   Life expectancy at that time was 65.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.980]   If you made it to 65, you had about a half a chance
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.460]   of living to 72.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.080]   So people did not live very long in retirement.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.520]   Most people died before retirement.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.420]   And as an emergency room doctor, I saw a lot of bad things.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.020]   You know, people die before their time
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.720]   or have just these horrible events or illnesses happen
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.660]   that forever change their trajectory of life.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.460]   And I just think we're so messed up in this country
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.460]   about how hard we work for this endgame of retirement
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.860]   when we need to enjoy life along the way.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.700]   And so in our practice, the number one question,
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.080]   I have a whole talk I do around this at conferences,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.100]   it's called Are You Happy Now?
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.020]   And so the number one thing we do with clients
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.680]   is are you happy now, and if not, why?
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.220]   Kills me when I get somebody who's like 50
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.100]   and they say, "I hate my job, I wanna quit at 55."
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.940]   Well, that's the wrong goal, you know,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.660]   'cause work gives a sense of purpose.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.480]   You're not meant to live on your money for 30 years
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.220]   without, and give up your safest asset,
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.100]   both psychologically and financially,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.260]   and that's your human capital,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720]   your ability to contribute to society.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   So we focus on trying to get people to work less
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.740]   when they're young and enjoy life more along the way
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.460]   and plan on working longer
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.560]   so you have that psychological and financial safety,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.620]   but plus it also helps reduce your risk of dementia
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.060]   and cognitive decline as you age.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.360]   - I just wanna follow up on that,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.700]   and so it's funny that you're saying
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.380]   we talk too much about retirement,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.020]   I just finished a book on retirement.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.540]   (all laughing)
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.060]   But I could not agree more.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.820]   In fact, in the book, Laura Karstensen,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.740]   who's a researcher at Stanford,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.060]   says something that really sticks with me.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.140]   She says, "Work is good for us,
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.780]   "the way we work is all wrong."
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.860]   That people are just crawling to the finish line,
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860]   completely burned out.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.620]   We know some people die right after they retire,
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.660]   and so I could not echo Carolyn's sentiment more
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.440]   that being thoughtful about what you want
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.340]   from your work life,
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.980]   picking up on Jordan Grumet's idea
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.980]   of creating addition by subtraction,
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.860]   like take note of your calendar
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.420]   as you go through your weeks if you're still working.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.500]   If you look ahead and you see,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.220]   okay, oh God, yeah, that day,
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.180]   those things that fill you with dread,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.340]   if you're in good standing with your employer,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.340]   see if you can't find your way to do less of those things.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.080]   So for me, it was managing people, it was meetings,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.620]   those were things kind of in my stop doing list,
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.580]   and I wanted to do more writing on my own,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.940]   I wanted to work on a book,
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.900]   and so just be really thoughtful
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.480]   about observing what's working for you about work.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.500]   Maybe nothing is,
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.420]   and you need to do something completely different,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.440]   but maybe there are some kernels there,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.560]   and try to see if you can't bring them forward
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.900]   in your work life.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.140]   Try to find better balance, certainly,
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.480]   to just make sure that you are enjoying work
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.540]   as you're going along.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.840]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.700]   I call myself a part-time self-employed,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.100]   so to me, that's a very good arrangement.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.180]   I work on what I want to work on,
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.980]   I control my own hours,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.500]   so then that's a good transition
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   versus working full-time 100% and then retire 100%.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.020]   - And I know, Harry, you have said,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.360]   you've written about priorities also,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.740]   and one of the things,
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.140]   you know, this is a crowd of people,
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.580]   many of whom are very into investing,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.180]   put a lot of energy into personal finance.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.980]   You've suggested maybe we don't have to be
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.700]   quite so obsessive about that, right,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.420]   as Paula would say, right?
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.340]   - Yes, I'm very big on reducing stress and anxiety,
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.780]   maybe just because I'm naturally an anxious person.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.980]   So if, also, news media tend to sell
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.460]   on fear of making mistakes, making you anxious,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.780]   create the impression that there are landmines
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.020]   left and right everywhere,
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.680]   that you're gonna make a mistake.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.020]   So if you feel anxious and overwhelmed,
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.460]   I would suggest that you take a step back
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.540]   and evaluate where you are.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.220]   Are you on solid ground, you're 90% there,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.540]   or are you fighting between failure and success?
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.020]   The financial planning moves
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.260]   tend to be on the side of improving things.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.740]   They make good things, good situation better.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.700]   I was in Mike's presentation yesterday,
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.020]   so he pointed out that Roth conversions
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.140]   increase your bequest to your heirs,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.940]   but they don't raise your financial security.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.060]   So if you're already 90% there,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.900]   you're all for improving, that's great,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.700]   that's all we're here for.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.580]   But if you make your plan contingent
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.100]   on making all the expert moves
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   on knowing how much international small cap value
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.460]   or real estate or Bitcoin in your portfolio,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.260]   claiming social security at the right age,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.440]   having the right order of withdrawals from your accounts,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.180]   having the well-calibrated Roth convergence,
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.460]   I would say that's probably not a good plan
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.180]   because those are too fragile.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.740]   They count on everything has to line up perfectly
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.200]   for you to succeed.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.460]   I'd rather see a plan that's naively counting
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.700]   on target date fund,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.540]   claiming social security at the full retirement age,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.980]   withdrawing from my accounts proportionally
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.180]   and not doing any Roth conversion.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.900]   If my plan is successful
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.140]   based on those seemingly suboptimal moves,
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.840]   then I know I'm good no matter what.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.500]   Then I can pick and choose at my own leisure
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   at here and there, learn things.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.680]   Everything can only improve from here.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.840]   So then I'm less conscious, I'm more confident.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.740]   - And Harry, you had said about simplifying.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.080]   Give us a couple of examples of things at the margin
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.400]   that I could let go of
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.140]   and not feel like I absolutely have to optimize.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.040]   - Sure.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.440]   I did a presentation for Sacramento San Jose chapters
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.740]   in June, so I did lots of simplifications move here.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.520]   So for myself, I use one bank account for everything,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   so checking and saving all in one pot.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.920]   So I don't move money across different accounts.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   I use one credit card for all my purchases.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.800]   I don't use one card for this, another card for that.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.840]   I use one broker for 95% of all my investments
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.960]   between Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, pick one.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.860]   They're all pretty much the same.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   For as much as I love iBonds, I sold a lot of my iBonds.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.840]   I just use a TIPS fund.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.280]   I wrote a book on TIPS.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.800]   I know how a TIPS ladder works.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.360]   I know the difference between a fund and a ladder,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.000]   but I just use a fund, so.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   - Yeah, I wanna add to that just real quick.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.320]   You're gonna be great to work with as you age
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.000]   and get cognitive decline.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.240]   So simplicity is so important, right?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.580]   It's so important for when you can no longer do it
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.480]   for people to be able to take over for you,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   so that's beautiful.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.120]   - And I know, Carolyn, you talk also about resiliency.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   So what do you mean by that when you say
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.760]   that that's a focus that you work on with clients?
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   What does that mean?
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.080]   - So to me, you can never predict what's going to happen,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.480]   and I talk about complex adaptive system science,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.160]   and that's basically we don't know what we don't know.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   And our goal in our practice is not for people
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.840]   to have this endgame of a certain amount of money
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.780]   at a certain time.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.000]   It's to make sure that they have enough savings,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.040]   emergency funds, and that they're saving enough
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.720]   for the future that no matter what life throws them,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.360]   they're gonna be resilient and ready for that.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.160]   And that's, you look at the studies on regret,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.200]   and our number, the other thing we try to get people to do
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.720]   is is there anything, if you didn't do it,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.880]   you'd have regret?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.720]   And so when people have less regret
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.880]   and something bad happens,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.240]   they're actually more resilient
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   and able to weather that bad thing happening more easily.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   So focusing on gratitude builds resiliency.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   Focusing on relationships build resiliency.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760]   So it's more than just money.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.960]   It's making certain you're living fully in the moment
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.200]   so when the world falls apart
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.800]   that you're gonna have less regret
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.040]   and be better able to weather it.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.720]   And one thing I always say to people,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.920]   and you talked about anxiety.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.120]   For me, I always ask myself,
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.680]   when something bad has happened,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   she's heard me say this before and people gross out,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.880]   will I be able to wipe my butt?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.800]   Because if you can wipe your butt,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.000]   it means your brain works, your hands work,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.760]   and that you're gonna get through this.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.200]   So just step back and think, is this really the worst case?
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.560]   And most of the time it's not.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.400]   And when you can recognize that,
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.040]   it lets you be able to weather
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.720]   whatever's happening a little bit better.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.760]   - Related to being able to weather tough times,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.640]   what are some of the financial things
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.240]   that bogal heads should be doing
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   that maybe they aren't doing?
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.760]   Do you wanna address that, John?
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.680]   - Yeah, I really like what Harry is doing
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   in simplifying his finances
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   because I think one thing that folks often ignore
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.080]   when choosing the more complicated approach,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   having multiple accounts to get a signup bonus
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.440]   or chasing the highest yield,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.240]   is that assuming there's no downside to that strategy.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.880]   And there is a downside, it's complexity.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.240]   And if you don't do what you need to do right,
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   then you might just shoot yourself in the foot
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   and not get the benefit of all that complexity
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.760]   in the first place.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.480]   And then to speak to the theme of Paula Pant,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.000]   yes, you can afford anything but not everything.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.200]   So if you're using your energy to chase the highest yield
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.520]   on a savings account or a CD,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.880]   that means you're not doing something else.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.440]   Human energy, time, attention is limited.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.920]   So you can only do a few things well.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.800]   Are you gonna do it to chase the highest yield
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.160]   or are you gonna do it to make sure
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.960]   your estate planning is done?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.600]   A lot of time folks come to me when working with me
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.640]   and they wanna talk about how to manage taxes
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.360]   when selling the concentrated Apple stock position.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   And I understand that can be an important point to them,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.120]   but that can be so largely irrelevant
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.680]   if they haven't done something like their estate planning,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   have enough umbrella insurance, for example.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   So yes, we love investing, it's so sexy and interesting
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.640]   and we hate taxes and we wanna manage those,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.720]   but often they're not always the most important thing
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.160]   that we can be thinking about.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.040]   - Right, so this goes to what Paula was saying
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.640]   about the areas we may be avoidant of.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.680]   And sometimes they are emotionally difficult too.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.720]   Some of the things you have to wrestle with
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.440]   in making your estate planning documents,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.840]   all the dire scenarios you have to talk about
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.800]   and things you have to think about.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.440]   - Yeah, just one thing to add.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.640]   Financial planning is a broad field,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.160]   but on Bogleheads we spend 95% of the time
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   talking about investing, which is one piece of it.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   And the other 5% is taxes, that's what we talk about.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.760]   We spend almost no time talking about estate planning
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.960]   or insurance, even though those are so critical.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   And that happens all the time.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.200]   People come to me and they wanna do this deep dive
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.520]   on Roth conversions and it's well, we can do that,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.280]   but there's six other things that are such high priority
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.840]   and you don't have these boxes checked off yet.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.720]   And basic estate planning documents,
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.240]   you don't have disability insurance,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.840]   but you're still definitely not financially independent.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.480]   I mean, whatever it is, there's so much more
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.760]   to financial planning than your asset allocation.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.040]   And on Bogleheads, we just spend so much time
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   talking about just a few things.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   - I couldn't agree more, Mike.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.600]   And I have this conversation all the time
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.720]   with individuals who say, I need a financial advisor.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.120]   And so I'll listen to them and I'll be like,
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.000]   kind of sounds like you need a financial planner,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.360]   especially when I'm moving in Boglehead circles.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   And I have to say, it's kind of a tough sell
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   about why they're so focused on the investment piece.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.360]   They have questions there and they really underrate
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.880]   the financial planning piece.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.960]   So I would say, if you go into it, my guess is many of you
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   probably need financial planning
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   more than you need investment advice.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.920]   You may need both.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.600]   And sort of the counter to that is,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   if you're meeting advisors and their main selling point
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.240]   is I'm gonna do this, this, and this for your portfolio
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.320]   and they're not talking about financial planning,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.560]   they're serving you in a very limited way.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.160]   And many advisors still style themselves in this fashion.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.680]   And if they're charging you a very low fee
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.040]   to do that investment piece, that's one thing.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.520]   But many of them are charging the full 1% AUM
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.120]   for something that looks to me an awful lot
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.920]   like just sort of investment management
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.280]   and they're ignoring the financial planning piece
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.920]   or might be doing a few things around the margin.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.040]   So just find there's a mismatch
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.480]   in terms of what people think they need
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   and what I believe they need.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.160]   And I think they need more financial planning.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.280]   - And the one thing I wanna really add to me,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.120]   the most important question you have to ask yourself
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.880]   is what is the goal of your money?
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.600]   The money is the tool, it should not be the object.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.360]   And I've talked, I have loved this conference
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.480]   and so many of you have come up and talked to me
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.320]   and I can tell you most of you
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.040]   don't really know the goal for your money.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   And when you understand what you need, why you need it,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.280]   then it makes it much easier to create a financial plan
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   that actually serves you well
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.840]   to create a great life for yourself
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.800]   'cause that's what you're trying to do.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.440]   - Yeah, just echoing one thing Christine said
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.600]   about financial planning versus investment management.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.560]   Literally I checked in on the forum Thursday night
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   very recently and there was a post discussing John actually,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.920]   discussing John and Rick and someone said,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.760]   well, I just don't see how John could possibly
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.480]   do anything better and beat a Vanguard Balanced Index Fund
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.040]   and how that would be worth the fees.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   And it's like, you're exactly missing the point.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.640]   The fact that you think that that is
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.080]   what a financial planner does
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.200]   is try to beat a Vanguard Balanced Fund
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.400]   tells me that there's almost for sure
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.080]   some things in your financial planning picture
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.200]   that you're not looking at
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.400]   and that you actually would benefit
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.760]   from working with John or somebody else.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.680]   - I think we'll shift to retirement a little bit.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.480]   So I will say I am partway through
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.000]   Christine's wonderful book.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.560]   I am reading it just as Jonathan Clements says
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.360]   in the introduction with a pen.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.400]   I am underlying quite a lot.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   So Christine, I want to ask you to share with us
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   some of the lessons in the book,
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.780]   either things that resonate with you personally
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.920]   or lessons you think don't get enough attention.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.400]   - Yeah, thanks, Karen.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.600]   So the book, people may be surprised,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.360]   is not all financial.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.720]   It's about half or maybe more non-financial.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   So it's a lot about having a vision for retirement,
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.760]   picking up on Jordan Grumman,
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.960]   the idea of having purpose.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.240]   If you got purpose through work,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.040]   just making sure that you're having something else
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.280]   that gives you purpose when and if you retire from work.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.000]   The book I should explain for people who don't know,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.880]   each chapter is an interview
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.440]   about how to do some aspect of retirement planning.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.040]   And the contributors are well-represented
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.000]   at this conference.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So Jordan Grumman does a discussion with me,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   Mike Piper, Carolyn McClanahan,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.160]   Mike on taxes, Carolyn on healthcare.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.200]   But we do cover a lot of non-financial ground
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.120]   because I have to say,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.320]   as I've kind of moved along in my life,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   I feel like I've got the financial piece well in hand.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.400]   Like there are always things I could do better.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   But the allocation that makes,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.160]   that is just more important to me at this life stage
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.640]   is my time on earth allocations.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.560]   Like what decisions am I making with this precious life?
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   I have a friend right now who is about my age,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.320]   dying in hospice with ovarian cancer.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.560]   So, and a healthy, aggressively healthy person.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.600]   And so these things can just come up
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.000]   and very quickly turn everything around.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.440]   So that's what I wanted the book to be
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.800]   is sort of like you have this wonderful life,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   what will you do to maximize
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.360]   however many years you have left?
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.600]   And so that was something I wanted to
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.760]   bring out loud and clear.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.940]   So we talk about relationships,
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.560]   purpose certainly,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.840]   perhaps the role of working in some fashion longer.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.400]   Scott Burns, who was our speaker last night,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.600]   night said something to me.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.440]   He's not in the book,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.880]   but he said something to me in another conversation.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.960]   He had tried to retire and he said,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.320]   he was stocking shelves in the food pantry.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.080]   And he said, even though he enjoyed that work,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.320]   he said, I took a step back and realized
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.120]   that my highest, best use in this world
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.920]   was probably not stocking food pantry shelves.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.320]   Even though I liked meeting people
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.880]   and I wanted to continue to do it,
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.480]   it was probably going back to some version
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.000]   of my life's work.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.960]   The work that he did with financial education
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.840]   in his column.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.780]   And so I guess for me,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.320]   that's something I've been thinking about
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.820]   and I would urge all of you to think about.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.680]   Is there an aspect of your work
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.080]   or maybe something that you didn't explore in your work
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.680]   that you wanna carry forward later in life?
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.400]   I'm hoping people will come away
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.960]   with some impetus to think through those things.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.920]   - One of the things that many people talk about
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.480]   as they're thinking about retirement
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.980]   is where they wanna live.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.960]   So I know, Harry, you had shared
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.480]   that you've lived in five houses in three states
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.800]   in the last six years
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.300]   after leaving your full-time job in California.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.840]   Tell us a little bit about that adventure
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.440]   and lessons you've learned along the way.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.260]   - Sure.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.260]   I worked in San Jose, California for about 20 years.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.120]   Quit my job in 2018.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.720]   We moved to Nevada, Reno, Nevada in 2020,
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.900]   right before the pandemic.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.880]   Moved again in 2021 to our current place,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.420]   Midway, Utah, about one hour east of Salt Lake City.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.960]   Out of all those moves,
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.160]   I think my biggest takeaway is,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.340]   A, you don't have to move.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.720]   News media publish a lot of lists,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.200]   best places to retire in America.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.920]   They create the impression that everybody has to move
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.280]   or everybody's supposed to move.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.960]   If you have your family,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.520]   you have your kids grow up in the area,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   they're still there.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.560]   You have your network, you have your activities.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.280]   Don't have to move.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.940]   If you do move, I would say,
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.940]   have a strong non-financial reason for your move.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.040]   You want to move closer to your family
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.360]   or for us, it's activities.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.460]   We like skiing and hiking,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.040]   so we picked Reno, Nevada for skiing and hiking
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.800]   near Lake Tahoe area.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.000]   And then we found a better place in Midway, Utah,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and that's where we currently are.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.040]   Don't move for financial reasons.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.120]   Don't move because of cost of living or taxes.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.600]   So when we moved to Nevada,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.360]   people say, "Hey, you moved to Nevada, no state tax.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.200]   "You must have saved a lot of taxes."
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.780]   The first year that we moved there,
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.520]   we saved $1,000 in California state tax.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.680]   So, and then we moved to Utah.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.160]   Utah's state taxes are higher than California state taxes
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.860]   because it's a flat rate versus progressive.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.600]   So move because you like somewhere,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.320]   some activities there.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   Don't move because of cost of living or taxes.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.240]   Living comes first before costs.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.200]   - I have two important points to that.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   A lot of people want to move to where their kids are.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.500]   A high percentage of kids move
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.200]   after you move to where they are.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   And so be careful about that.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.240]   The second thing, I have seen this over and over.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.000]   Think about healthcare where you move.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.640]   Do not retire in rural areas.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   Rural areas are struggling with good healthcare.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.280]   If you need long-term care, long-term care services,
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.120]   it's almost impossible to get.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.320]   So be very careful that wherever you do move,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.680]   that you know there's a good healthcare community there
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.480]   and people that are gonna help you as you age.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.160]   - I guess it depends on your age.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.120]   I'm in my 50s.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   So I trust whatever illness I have,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.960]   anywhere in a good-sized metropolitan area,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.480]   doctors can treat me.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.120]   But if I develop some rare disease,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.800]   I have to live close to a Mayo Clinic
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.400]   or a Cleveland Clinic
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.240]   or that sort of caliber of medical facilities.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.520]   Yeah, definitely that's a consideration.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   - My book has a chapter on housing
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.800]   and I talked to Mark Miller
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   about all the different dimensions of housing,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   including home equity and potentially unlacking home equity.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.440]   But Mark made a really astute point about downsizing,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.080]   like getting into a more age-appropriate home,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   sort of separate from the relocation decision.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.040]   And his point was like,
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.760]   there's never a better time
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   than just when you're embarking on retirement.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.040]   You'll never be more in the driver's seat
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.680]   with the decision-making about where,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.840]   how that move gets executed,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.400]   how your possessions get disposed of.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.960]   And his point, I mean, many of us have been through this
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.360]   with older parents passing away
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.200]   where you're in charge of cleaning out
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.280]   a very large and full house.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.400]   It's not a great gift to get from your parents, I will say.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.920]   So if you can kind of get in front of that decision-making
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.840]   and that process,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.640]   I think that that redounds to the benefit
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.880]   of everyone's well-being,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.640]   yours and your family members.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.600]   - I wanna remind everyone,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.960]   if you have questions,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.640]   please write them on the little pieces of paper.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   Alan is walking around and he'll gather them up for us.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.720]   I wanted to turn the conversation a bit
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.480]   to charitable giving.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.880]   So we've talked about some tax strategies
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.920]   related to charitable giving,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.240]   that it can be efficient to leave tax-deferred IRAs
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   to charities or give appreciated securities
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.320]   to a donor-advised fund for later granting.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.040]   And I'm wondering just in sort of a bigger picture way,
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.360]   are there conversations that you have with clients
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.480]   or questions that we should be asking ourselves
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.160]   about how charitable giving fits into our goals?
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.840]   - At the risk of getting into the investing section,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.600]   I can see charitable giving as an opportunity
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.240]   to clean up one's portfolio.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.040]   A lot of times folks will come to me
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.000]   with some stuff they bought themselves
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.120]   or maybe some old employer stock,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   or often it's gonna be that 1% advisor portfolio
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.040]   that they've fired the advisor
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.640]   and now they're left with this dumpster fire
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.200]   of an investment portfolio.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.120]   And so that can be a good time
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.480]   to prioritize getting rid of those things
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.080]   in a tax-efficient manner,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.000]   giving it to a donor-advised fund, et cetera.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.040]   - Yeah, I'm not QCD ages yet.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.080]   So before QCD, donor-advised fund
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.000]   is probably the best vehicle.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.320]   But I would suggest if you use a donor-advised fund,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.240]   use it more as a pass-through.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.080]   Don't hold money there.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.760]   Donate to donor-advised funds
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.720]   and then disperse the money right away.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.640]   - I sort of disagree with that.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   It depends on the situation.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.200]   I mean, we've had clients with long-time
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.080]   donor-advised funds that are invested
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   and it's been fun for them that they've grown.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.360]   That pie that they're giving to charity
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.200]   and they're giving along the way.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.520]   But like I talked about the golden age
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.480]   of tax planning and retirement from 60 to 70 yesterday
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.160]   and we'll do a nice lump sum of appreciated stock,
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.520]   cleaning up portfolio like you said,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.240]   that we know what their charitable intentions are
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   for the next 10 years.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.040]   And now we've been able to do other nice things
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.560]   like get rid of other appreciated stock
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.640]   or do Roth conversions or IRA distributions.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   So it can, yes, there is a fee
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.680]   with having a charitable gift fund,
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.040]   but it's not that high.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.280]   I mean, well, fidelity is what we use
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.680]   and it's not that high to have that.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:39.120]   And so, I mean, every situation's different.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.160]   And so just make sure that you're thinking through
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.520]   both short-term and long-term
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   about what your goals are charitably
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.760]   and doing it in the most tax-efficient manner.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.200]   - I will say, I kind of agree with Harry though.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.920]   I do not understand why the fees are so high.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.640]   If I'm putting some plain vanilla security in there
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.440]   like employer stock from a large company,
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.320]   why am I having this, is it 50 basis points
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.060]   or something drag on?
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.000]   I don't understand what the fees are about.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.720]   So, you know, when you give money to,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.880]   when you put it into fidelity charitable,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.480]   the fees are not 50 basis points.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.800]   It's actually a lot lower.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.280]   The reason the fees are there is because they have to check
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.560]   and make sure the charities are qualified charities.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.320]   So it's more, it's a logistical thing.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   Your stock is going to be sold
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   and that's going to be invested in a diversified portfolio.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.640]   So, you know, there's a fee for that.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   I don't think it's, I mean, let me,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.240]   I think fidelity's 35 basis points.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.760]   So it's not, and it goes down.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.560]   So it's not that high,
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.560]   but that's what you pay for, for that tax efficiency.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.640]   - A thing I didn't know about donor advised funds
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.240]   until became the treasurer of a nonprofit organization,
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.560]   Schwab Charitable, they don't have direct deposit.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.700]   They just send you a check every time.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.960]   What the heck?
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.800]   (all laughing)
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.160]   - Yeah. Fidelity Vanguard.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.480]   Yeah. It's just, anyway, small little tidbit.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.840]   I love donor advised funds.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.420]   One thing I do like to point out,
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:25.000]   because some people, financial services companies,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.260]   promote them as this tax strategy.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:33.000]   They are helpful, but they are an administrative tool.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.840]   Like any tax savings you would have had
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.320]   from donating to a donor advised fund,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.880]   it's exactly, literally precisely the same
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.820]   as if you just donated to some other charity.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.540]   They're helpful from an administrative point of view,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.280]   because you can do, like we were just talking about,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.920]   where you can donate some all at once,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.440]   get some tax savings right now,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.720]   and then spread that out over some years,
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.120]   or useful if you want to keep yourself anonymous
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.320]   so you don't end up on mailing lists.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.460]   Also convenient if you have your Vanguard account
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.560]   and Vanguard charitable account,
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.160]   so you can just add your appreciated stock
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.560]   to the charitable fund, whereas not every organization
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.040]   is set up for you to give them shares of stock.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.320]   So lots of administrative benefits,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.680]   but it's just the same thing from a tax point of view.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.880]   And I'm gonna add one thing to that.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   I find that when clients set up a charitable giving fund,
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.100]   and I don't know, I only use Fidelity,
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.680]   I haven't used any other ones,
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.800]   it's so easy to give away money,
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.880]   so they become more charitable,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.320]   which is, for a lot of our clients, it's a good thing.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.480]   And I actually have a Fidelity donor advised fund,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.800]   and I get on there, and it keeps this big list
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   of all the shares, it's like, oh, I gotta give money to them,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.880]   and you just go cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.080]   And so I don't know whether that's good or bad.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.000]   If you have a client with spending issues, it's bad,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   but if you have a client that needs to be more charitable,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.900]   it's a good thing.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.920]   - I'm gonna turn to a different topic.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.480]   So we're hearing every day, cyber frauds,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.600]   data breaches, all sorts of scams out there.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.640]   Are there steps that people should take
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.120]   to protect themselves?
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.560]   Asking for a friend, should I finally do
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.160]   those credit freezes that people talk about?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.040]   - Yes. - Yes, awesome.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:20.520]   Any other steps I should be doing besides that?
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   - Yeah, freeze your credit, freeze your spouse's credit,
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.920]   freeze your kid's credit.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   Gosh, be very suspicious of any text messages you get.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   Don't click on any links on any text messages.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.040]   If a financial institution calls you or texts you
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.780]   and says there's an issue, do not respond via that medium.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.840]   Say, thank you for the information, hang up,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.780]   and then go to the website and contact them via the website,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.160]   via the phone number that's on the website.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   Moreover, do not Google an organization's phone number,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.960]   'cause that is a common scam now.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.160]   The scammers are getting really good at SEO.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.200]   So if you're looking for a financial institution's
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.320]   phone number, and you failed a Vanguard or whatever,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.480]   and you Google it as opposed to going to the site directly,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.320]   the search tools may pull from a scammer's website,
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.640]   and then you'll be connected directly to a scammer.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.080]   So always connect with the organization directly
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.320]   on your own, even if that organization
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.060]   supposedly reaches out to you.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.840]   - I would find having fewer accounts
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.880]   or fewer institutions help.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.600]   So if I get a scam message saying my Chase account
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.560]   has some problems, I don't have a Chase account.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.640]   So if I only have one account,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.760]   then those messages will tend to have less effect.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.680]   In this realm, I find usually brokers
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.140]   have better security than banks,
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.220]   because they deal with large sum of money.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.600]   So that's why I use a broker account for my cash flow.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.320]   - One piece of feedback we had on this conference
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.800]   is that this would be a good future session.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.640]   So I have taken that away, how to protect yourself,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.760]   you know, all dimensions of your financial life
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.600]   from fraudsters.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   I think that would be a great next session.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.220]   Couple things I would add.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.040]   Password manager is a really good practice.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.080]   If you haven't set one up, it's a little bit of a pain
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.220]   to set it up, but once it's up and running,
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.560]   it's not too difficult.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.480]   And then I just wanted to mention,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.320]   we did for our podcast a conversation with Kathy Stokes,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   who is director of fraud prevention for AARP.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.160]   And I asked, so where is sort of the epicenter
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.600]   of financial fraud right now?
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.640]   And her answer was very clear, crypto, crypto, crypto.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.440]   And she said that there is so much scamming going on
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.380]   in the crypto space.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.820]   So for those of you who are crypto curious,
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.240]   after Matt Hogan and Rick Ferry talked yesterday,
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.920]   just really be on your guard in that space.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.740]   Not everyone is out to scam people in the crypto space,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.240]   but I think scams are alive and well there,
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.020]   and it's certainly less regulated,
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.280]   so you just need to be super careful.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.720]   - One thing I wanna add,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.880]   not that I'm pushing financial advisors,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.640]   but we get, as an independent RIA,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.960]   we sometimes get people calling us,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.160]   trying to impersonate a client to try to get money.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   And we know every client, and it's interesting,
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.420]   the stories we get told, but we catch it right away.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.260]   We have people try to email us
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.700]   when they've hacked into a client's email,
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.600]   email us pretending they're a client,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.100]   but we know our clients so well,
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.820]   and we have processes in place to call the client.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.740]   And then as soon as we recognize
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.180]   that a client's been compromised, we freeze everything.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.680]   We notify the custodian.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.300]   So that is, especially as you get older,
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.500]   the scams are getting hard, just amazing what they do.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.720]   So that is one benefit as you get older
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.700]   and maybe facing some cognitive decline
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.140]   of working with an advisor.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.360]   Again, not that I'm pushing, but it's another layer of help.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.500]   - So we've talked some, Carolyn talked yesterday
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.780]   about getting a less involved spouse
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.100]   more involved in the finances.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.980]   Mike did a great session on that last year.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.180]   Harry, when we spoke before this session,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.500]   he said something that really resonated for me
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.980]   'cause it would be like the kind of thing
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.860]   that I would be guilty of.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.220]   Just writing down a complex system really doesn't help.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   So tell us some more things that would be helpful
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.420]   in getting a less financially involved spouse
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.200]   ready to be more involved if necessary.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.900]   - Sure, I read Mike's excellent book
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.100]   "After the Death of Your Spouse" or something like that.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.220]   My biggest impression from reading the book
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.660]   is it's a little late by that time.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   So you wanna get your spouse involved or partner,
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.800]   get them on the same page, keeping them informed.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.460]   Part of the battle is just know what you have.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.780]   So Mike talks a lot in the book
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.180]   about how to find out where you have your accounts.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.240]   It's a little late there.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.060]   You don't wanna leave a detective worker
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.820]   for your spouse after you die.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.380]   So it's better to keep your spouse informed.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.540]   And the best way to do that is while you're still here.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.900]   And from my writing, a lot of people talk about
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.480]   having a death binder or a letter of instructions.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.980]   To me, that's less helpful
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.860]   because whenever I write something,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.260]   I always forget some basic
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.620]   because the knowledge level is different.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.740]   So what you deem, of course, assumptions,
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.700]   you have a lot of assumptions when you write down things,
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.380]   a lot of things that you didn't realize
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.060]   that's needed for your spouse to understand.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.140]   So if you make your system simple,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.460]   then you can involve your spouse right now.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.860]   Then you don't have to write that instruction.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.780]   Or better yet, have your spouse write down your system.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.780]   And then he or she is writing in his or her own notes
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.660]   and language, and then he or she knows
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.260]   what should be written down.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.180]   - Well, that's why we also have clients do yearly,
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.700]   what we call yearly audits with the spouse
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.500]   of them sitting down and going through things.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.860]   And we always say, make your spouse pay the bills,
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.980]   make your spouse look at the investments,
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.100]   make sure they can log into everything.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.980]   And just taking, it takes an hour or two each year
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.740]   to make sure that they're doing it.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.300]   And like I talked about yesterday,
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.140]   make sure they know how to get into your phone,
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.460]   that you don't just have a thumbprint on there
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.100]   that use the same similar passwords
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.060]   so you guys know how to get into each other's phones.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.860]   So there's lots you can do,
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.340]   it just, you have to be intentional about doing it,
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.460]   and it saves a ton of anguish
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.860]   when something actually happens.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.900]   - So I want to segue into a related question
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.100]   from the audience.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.460]   If one spouse is the bogal head
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.340]   and the other is less financially savvy,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.260]   what should I look for in a financial planner
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.060]   to help guide my spouse after I'm gone?
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:20.300]   - I think it's, to a very significant extent,
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.220]   the same things that you would just look for
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.060]   in a financial planner normally.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.020]   Is this a human being whom I trust?
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.540]   Do they have the levels and areas of expertise
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.740]   that are applicable to us?
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.740]   Because again, financial planning is a broad field,
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.340]   and so the financial planning that somebody needs
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.300]   in their 60s is different from in their 40s,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.540]   and it's different, again, from in their 80s.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.380]   So do I trust this person?
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.820]   Do they have the areas of expertise that I need?
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.780]   And is the way that I would be compensating them
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   something that makes sense to me and that I can afford?
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.380]   - Do they have your same investment philosophy?
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.660]   That's key.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.380]   - And Rick Ferry once made the point
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.620]   that I've often thought about,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.580]   which is take that next step and introduce them
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.620]   preemptively if you've identified the person.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.180]   Just make sure that they click,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.840]   that your spouse is comfortable sharing information
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.780]   with that person.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.860]   Does he or she address the spouse who's not engaged?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.540]   All that interpersonal stuff I think is very important
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.780]   to do a check on just to make sure
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.460]   that the spouse has that comfort level.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.620]   - I wanna echo that point by both Rick and Christine
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.220]   and add it to not just your financial advisor,
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.700]   your financial planner, but your tax professional,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.180]   your estate planning attorney as well.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.900]   Any other trusted parties who your spouse
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.860]   is gonna turn to in that worst case?
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.200]   - I don't have a financial advisor.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.300]   So I go back to simplicity.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.980]   If I make my system simple enough,
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.620]   maybe my wife doesn't need a financial advisor.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:57.620]   So last year I had my wife do our taxes.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.980]   She opened up TurboTax.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.060]   I was sitting by her side.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.500]   She went through all the steps.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.620]   She wrote down the notes and then she actually
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.540]   clicked the button to file the taxes.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.380]   So treat it like training a new hire.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.420]   Then make sure that she understands.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.380]   - So okay, so I had a client, I have a client.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.940]   Her husband was a CPA and he had colon cancer.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.020]   They were not clients at the time.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.900]   And he said you cannot hire a financial advisor
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.260]   'cause you can't trust him.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.620]   I have done this financial plan for you.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.380]   He had like this life, they were in their 50s,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.580]   they had this life plan and she was a smart woman
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.040]   but she just wasn't into investments.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.820]   And then the year after he died,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.780]   that's when the stock market fell apart
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.700]   and she was so upset and stressed
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.740]   because she didn't know how to deal with it.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.500]   So a friend of hers talked her into coming to us.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.860]   So you can't control your spouse from the grave
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.100]   and it's great to me that you're doing that
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.340]   but still if they don't have the interest or inclination
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.140]   and they're gonna get old at some point and need help,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.500]   it's really good to make sure you have some sort of backup
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   whether it's a savvy family member or an advisor
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.700]   but you can't control from the grave.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.300]   So don't try to teach them everything
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.420]   and think they're gonna do it
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.420]   'cause the plan's not gonna work out like you expect.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.600]   - Okay, another question.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.340]   My parents are 80, they have a funded trust,
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.520]   a binder with all their financial home information,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.920]   their wills.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.640]   As they age and begin to decline mentally,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.200]   what should I do to protect their financial legacy?
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.480]   Should they add me as a fiduciary?
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.640]   Should I get alerts on their accounts?
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.600]   What should I do?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.760]   - Well, you know, this is my love of mine to work.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.800]   So this needs to be a gradual process.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.920]   You know, especially for do-it-yourselfers,
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.120]   taking care of your money is a sense of purpose to you.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.800]   And so you don't wanna rip that
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.540]   from your parents away immediately.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.200]   You want to make it,
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.800]   so we first start off with financial transparency,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.600]   not just with one person but with the entire family
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.320]   so that there's nobody worrying
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   that somebody's trying to take advantage of other people.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.240]   And then as they have issues,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   then you start having that look behind.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.720]   And so whether they're logging into your accounts,
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.520]   you know, we use an e-money portal
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.160]   where everything gets scraped
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.220]   and is in one financial portal
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.160]   that the surrogate can look through
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.280]   to make sure everything looks good.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.440]   And then you might still let them write,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.520]   if they become more declining,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.720]   let them write the bills but don't let them send them in.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.520]   You check the bills before they get turned in.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.800]   The same with the tax return.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.920]   You know, to me, at that point,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.440]   maybe you should be getting an outside accountant.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.320]   And you've gotta make sure
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.700]   that you have that power of attorney document.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.480]   It depends on the estate issues.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.020]   It's easier to become a joint account holder
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.560]   for that checking account where the bills are paid,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.080]   even though that child who's the surrogate
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.760]   is gonna get that money.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.120]   If you don't have joint accounts,
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.320]   then somebody dies and that account gets frozen.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.960]   And so, you know, there's pros and cons of joint account
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.420]   versus using a power of attorney,
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.120]   but you've got to figure out what's right for you,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.240]   but make it a gradual process.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.920]   And what ends up happening with a lot of older people
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.960]   is once they feel comfortable with whoever's taking over,
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.560]   they're like, "God, I'm happy not doing this."
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.440]   And then they just let the child take over.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.680]   And, but again, you wanna keep transparency the whole way.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.080]   As we talked about yesterday,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.020]   90% of financial fraud is actually perpetrated
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.000]   by people who are close to you.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.120]   So that's why it's important to have transparency
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.620]   and multiple people involved.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.400]   - Carolyn, I have a question for you about that.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.080]   When my parents were declining,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.920]   I had full trading authority on all of their accounts.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.840]   Is that recommended or is that,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.000]   and again, it depends on the relationship,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.320]   but is that risky?
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.400]   - Risky in what way?
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.000]   - Risky in that you have to have complete and utter trust
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.040]   in that person you've given that authority to.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.240]   - Well, and so ideally,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.040]   you've got to trust somebody as you age.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.520]   So first off, it's important for everybody
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.120]   to be clear on their investment policy.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.400]   I see so many families
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.760]   not having an investment policy statement.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   How is my money gonna be invested?
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.080]   And so if you have a younger child
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.060]   who has a different investment philosophy than you,
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.880]   that is dangerous.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.040]   If you have multiple children
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.760]   that one person's doing it and the other ones don't know,
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.600]   that can cause some issues.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.840]   So you've got to trust in somebody.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.680]   And if you don't trust them from the beginning,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.720]   and that's also why it's good to let this happen
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.640]   while your brain is still there
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.900]   so you can watch that surrogate in action
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.840]   and feel comfortable with what they're doing
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.560]   so that when you are losing it,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.240]   you know they're gonna do the right thing.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.600]   - I think we're gonna circle back to a couple of things,
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.280]   a little bit more in the investment space.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.280]   From your point of view, this is very different,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.620]   from your point of view,
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.480]   what's the true difference between Fidelity and Vanguard?
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yes, Fidelity is privately owned,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.620]   but is that a reason to move
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.680]   my entire Fidelity portfolio to Vanguard?
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.080]   - No, no, not at all.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:38.200]   To me, as an individual DIY investor,
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.980]   the differences are very minimal.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.960]   They all have the ability to build
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.480]   a low-cost, diversified, simple portfolio.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.720]   Like Rick said yesterday, at some of the firms,
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.080]   you'll maybe get more incoming sales contact.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.480]   As Bogleheads, hopefully you know,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.540]   that, you know, opt out, basically.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.400]   But no, they're all very, very fine
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.440]   in terms of almost all of the stuff that matters, really.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.680]   - Well, and the one thing, you just have to think of,
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.480]   they're both supermarkets.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.640]   You can pretty much buy anything you want there,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.080]   so you can buy all the low-cost ETFs and stuff,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.000]   and so it doesn't really matter.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.040]   They're the supermarkets.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   So to me, you have to look at
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.160]   what's giving the better client service,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.460]   and they all, I've been around so long,
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.400]   they all rotate when they stink, you know?
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.800]   And so, and when you are, you know,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.520]   working with them and they stink, you complain,
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.360]   and a lot of times they fix it.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.200]   You know, so for us, we use Fidelity,
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.280]   'cause they've done a good job.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.000]   Vanguard has gone through periods
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.240]   where they do a good job, doesn't,
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.080]   but Fidelity's done that, too.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.820]   So you just gotta look at the platform,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.920]   what's comfortable to you,
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.160]   who's giving you the better service.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   - If you're using a 60% stock, 40% bond portfolio,
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.280]   it's gotten you to your number
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.580]   for a comfortable, confident retirement,
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.440]   does it make sense to be more aggressive with stocks?
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.140]   Say, go up to 70% to try and earn more wealth?
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.640]   - Well, I'll be real quick.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.880]   It's like, what is, I said this earlier,
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.000]   what is the goal for your money?
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.180]   If you have a goal of trying to grow it,
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.160]   to leave it to your kids,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.920]   and you wanna take that risk
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.680]   that you're gonna either leave them more
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.120]   or you're gonna leave them less,
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.160]   then you can become more risky.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.840]   But you gotta make sure you understand
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.080]   what are your goals for your money,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.840]   do you have enough for yourself first,
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.920]   how much risk do you wanna take psychologically
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.680]   and financially for those goals?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.520]   That should drive that decision.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.480]   - Okay, I like when we agree.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.240]   - I think one mistake that I see folks make a lot
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.420]   when it comes to that stock-bond-mix decision
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.220]   is looking at only the amount of risks
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.060]   they're taking in that decision.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.660]   For example, hey, retirement's well-funded,
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.860]   so I wanna invest more aggressively in stocks.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.780]   Okay, yes, maybe it makes sense to take risks there,
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.260]   but think holistically about all the risks in your life
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.780]   and if you wanna be taking risks in all those other places.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.220]   So often what I see, for example,
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   is okay, yes, I'm fully funded for retirement,
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.780]   I'm gonna invest in more stock funds
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.540]   compared to bond funds for that reason,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.900]   and again, that might be reasonable,
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.360]   but also consider do you have a aggressive overweight
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.520]   relative to international, because that's more risk.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.080]   Are you holding a bunch of concentrated employer stock
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.800]   'cause you don't wanna sell it 'cause of taxes?
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.280]   Okay, that's more risk there.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.400]   Do you have additional money
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   in a non-qualified deferred comp plan of that same company?
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.920]   That's more risk yet.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.000]   Have you decided to self-fund for long-term care insurance?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.320]   That's more risk there.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.800]   So if deciding to be aggressive
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.060]   in the portfolio aspect of your life,
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.400]   look at everything holistically and decide
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.720]   should I also be aggressive in all these other places too?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.960]   - Just to follow up on that real quick.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.040]   So at the time when people feel like,
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.800]   eh, yay, I'm fully funded,
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.080]   they're also, you're also getting older, right,
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.380]   as the years go by, and so that may,
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.200]   as you get closer to needing the money,
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.840]   and of course it gets to Carolyn's point
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.400]   about what is the goal, but if your goal is to retire,
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.240]   you, you know, your portfolio may be larger,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.880]   you can spare more, but you also do need to de-risk.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.740]   I would say this is the main thing I encounter
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.900]   when I talk to older adults about their portfolios.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.460]   It is a tough sell getting people to de-risk appropriately,
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.260]   and you guys would know about this as well,
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.180]   but it, stocks have been great,
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.480]   and it is very difficult to encourage people
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.500]   to step away from them.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.100]   Bonds haven't made an especially great case
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.820]   for themselves over the past decade,
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.600]   but I do think, you know, as you get close to drawdown,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.000]   you need more bonds, you need more cash,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.340]   you still need stocks, but you, you really do need
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.860]   that balance at that life stage more than ever.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.860]   - Is there an advantage to converting
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.700]   Vanguard Mutual Fund shares to their ETF equivalents?
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:11.060]   - There can be an advantage if you're holding them
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.500]   in Fidelity accounts, converting them to ETFs
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.900]   allow you to buy Vanguard ETFs at no fee.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.840]   Fidelity does charge a fee if you buy Vanguard Mutual Funds.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.280]   They don't charge fees on selling,
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.960]   they only charge fees on buying.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.560]   - Okay, I think we are gonna wrap up here.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.500]   Thank you all for so many great questions.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.720]   Thank you to our panel.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   (audience cheering)
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.940]   you
