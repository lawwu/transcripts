[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.560]   - Okay, well, it's great to see so many people
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.700]   still hanging in here Sunday morning.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.840]   I wanna give a special shout out
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   to all of our first-time Boglehead attendees.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.200]   It's been so exciting to talk to so many of you
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.120]   over the last two days.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.600]   I think the first-timers, like all the rest of us,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.880]   probably will go home feeling, I hope,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.360]   that a lot of your core Boglehead principles
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.940]   have been reaffirmed, and probably, hopefully,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.960]   there are some things that you've been prompted
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   to think about or question that maybe you hadn't focused on,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840]   and probably a to-do list.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.000]   I definitely have a to-do list.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.780]   So I hope it's been a great experience for you.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.100]   For this panel, we have another wonderful panel.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.880]   I'm proud to have Christine Benz and Mike Piper
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.400]   and John Luskin to serve with them
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.340]   on the board of the Bogle Center.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.640]   We're thrilled to have Carolyn McClanahan here
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.360]   for her first Bogleheads Conference,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.120]   and a special welcome to Harry Sitt,
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.420]   who is here for his first Bogleheads Conference.
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.420]   Harry runs the popular blog, The Finance Buff.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.380]   He has written two books.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.260]   He's been a speaker to our San Jose
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.700]   and Sacramento Bogleheads chapters.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.340]   As at the other sessions,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340]   so just going from your left to right,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.340]   Mike Piper, Carolyn McClanahan, Christine Benz,
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.380]   Harry Sitt, and John Luskin.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380]   (audience applauds)
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.760]   As at our other sessions,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.860]   we'll encourage you to put questions on cards.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.980]   Alan Roth will be going around at some point.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.700]   He's in the back.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.160]   So we'd love to have your questions.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.420]   So we're gonna talk about a variety
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.260]   of financial planning topics in this session,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.860]   including planning for retirement.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.660]   We'll talk some about lessons
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.720]   from Christine's wonderful new book, How to Retire.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.580]   Before we get there, Carolyn,
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.980]   I wanna ask you about something you had said
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.020]   in preparing for this panel.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900]   You said you would, quote,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.300]   "Love to talk about how we need to quit
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.340]   "this unhealthy focus on retirement."
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.300]   What do you mean by that?
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.380]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.020]   You know, retirement was invented in the 1930s
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.980]   when Social Security came into being.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.700]   They picked the age of 65 for retirement.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.620]   Life expectancy at that time was 65.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740]   If you made it to 65,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.460]   you had about a half a chance of living to 72.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.080]   So people did not live very long in retirement.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.500]   Most people died before retirement.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.140]   And as an emergency room doctor,
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.420]   I saw a lot of bad things.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.020]   You know, people die before their time
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.720]   or have just these horrible events or illnesses happen
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.660]   that forever change their trajectory of life.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.460]   And I just think we're so messed up in this country
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.420]   about how hard we work for this end game of retirement
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.840]   when we need to enjoy life along the way.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.700]   And so in our practice, the number one question,
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.060]   I have a whole talk I do around this at conferences,
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.100]   it's called Are You Happy Now?
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.020]   And so the number one thing we do with clients
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.680]   is are you happy now, and if not, why?
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.220]   Kills me when I get somebody who's like 50
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.100]   and they say, "I hate my job, I wanna quit at 55."
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.940]   Well, that's the wrong goal, you know,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.660]   'cause work gives a sense of purpose.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.500]   You're not meant to live on your money for 30 years
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.220]   without, and give up your safest asset,
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.100]   both psychologically and financially,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.260]   and that's your human capital,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720]   your ability to contribute to society.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   So we focus on trying to get people to work less
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.740]   when they're young and enjoy life more along the way
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.460]   and plan on working longer
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.560]   so you have that psychological and financial safety,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   but plus it also helps reduce your risk of dementia
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.100]   and cognitive decline as you age.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.380]   - I just wanna follow up on that,
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.020]   and so it's funny that you're saying
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.420]   we talk too much about retirement,
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.080]   I just finished a book on retirement.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.580]   (laughing)
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.100]   But I could not agree more.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.860]   In fact, in the book, Laura Karstensen,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.780]   who's a researcher at Stanford,
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.100]   says something that really sticks with me.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.180]   She says, "Work is good for us,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.820]   "the way we work is all wrong."
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   That people are just crawling to the finish line,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   completely burned out.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.640]   We know some people die right after they retire,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.680]   and so I could not echo Carolyn's sentiment more
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.480]   that being thoughtful about what you want
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.400]   from your work life,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.000]   picking up on Jordan Gromit's idea
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   of creating addition by subtraction.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.080]   Take note of your calendar as you go through your weeks
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.440]   if you're still working.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.520]   If you look ahead and you see,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   okay, oh God, yeah, that day.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.240]   Those things that fill you with dread.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.400]   If you're in good standing with your employer,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   see if you can't find your way to do less of those things.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.120]   So for me, it was managing people, it was meetings.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.640]   Those were things kind of in my stop doing list,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.620]   and I wanted to do more writing on my own,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.980]   I wanted to work on a book.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.840]   And so just be really thoughtful about observing
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.480]   what's working for you about work.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.520]   Maybe nothing is,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.440]   and you need to do something completely different,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   but maybe there are some kernels there,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.560]   and try to see if you can't bring them forward
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920]   in your work life.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.160]   Try to find better balance, certainly,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.480]   to just make sure that you are enjoying work
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.560]   as you're going along.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.840]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.700]   I call myself a part-time self-employed.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.100]   So to me, that's a very good arrangement.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.200]   I work on what I want to work on.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.960]   I control my own hours.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.480]   So then that's a good transition
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   versus working full-time 100%, and then retire 100%.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.000]   - And I know, Harry, you have said,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.360]   you've written about priorities also.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.160]   And one of the things, this is a crowd of people,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.600]   many of whom are very into investing,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.160]   put a lot of energy into personal finance.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.980]   You've suggested maybe we don't have to be
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.420]   quite so obsessive about that, as Paula would say, right?
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.320]   - Yes, I'm very big on reducing stress and anxiety,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.780]   maybe just because I'm naturally an anxious person.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.980]   So also, news media tend to sell
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.480]   on fear of making mistakes, making you anxious,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.780]   create the impression that there are landmines
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.020]   left and right everywhere,
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.680]   that you're gonna make a mistake.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.020]   So if you feel anxious and overwhelmed,
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.460]   I would suggest that you take a step back
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.540]   and evaluate where you are.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.220]   Are you on solid ground, you're 90% there,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.540]   or are you fighting between failure and success?
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.580]   The financial planning moves tend to be
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.260]   on the side of improving things.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.720]   They make good things, good situation better.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.680]   I was in Mike's presentation yesterday,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.000]   so he pointed out that Roth conversions
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.140]   increase your bequest to your heirs,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.940]   but they don't raise your financial security.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.060]   So if you're already 90% there,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.900]   you're all for improving, that's great,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.700]   that's all we're here for.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.580]   But if you make your plan contingent
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.100]   on making all the expert moves
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   on knowing how much international small cap value
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.460]   or real estate or Bitcoin in your portfolio,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.260]   claiming social security at the right age,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.440]   having the right order of withdrawals from your accounts,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.180]   having the well-calibrated Roth convergence,
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.460]   I would say that's probably not a good plan
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.180]   because those are too fragile.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.740]   They count on everything has to line up perfectly
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.200]   for you to succeed.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.460]   I'd rather see a plan that's naively counting
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.020]   on a target date fund, claiming social security
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.540]   at the full retirement age,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.980]   withdrawing from my accounts proportionally
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.180]   and not doing any Roth conversion.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.900]   If my plan is successful
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.140]   based on those seemingly sub-optimal moves,
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.840]   then I know I'm good no matter what.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.500]   Then I can pick and choose at my own leisure
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   out here and there, learn things.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.680]   Everything can only improve from here.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.840]   So then I'm less conscious, I'm more confident.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.740]   - And Harry, you had said about simplifying.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.080]   Give us a couple of examples of things at the margin
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.240]   that I could let go of and not feel
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.140]   like I absolutely have to optimize.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.260]   - Sure, I did a presentation
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.140]   for Sacramento San Jose chapters in June.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.740]   So I did lots of simplifications move here.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.500]   So for myself, I use one bank account for everything.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.440]   So checking and saving all in one pot.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.920]   So I don't move money across different accounts.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   I use one credit card for all my purchases.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.800]   I don't use one card for this, another card for that.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.840]   I use one broker for 95% of all my investments
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.960]   between Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, pick one.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.840]   They're all pretty much the same.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   For as much as I love iBonds, I sold a lot of my iBonds.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.840]   I just use a TIPS fund.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.280]   I wrote a book on TIPS.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.800]   I know how a TIPS ladder works.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.360]   I know the difference between a fund and a ladder,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.000]   but I just use a fund, so.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   - Yeah, I wanna add to that just real quick.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.340]   You're gonna be great to work with as you age
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.980]   and get cognitive decline.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.240]   So simplicity is so important, right?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.560]   Is so important for when you can no longer do it
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.480]   for people to be able to take over for you.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   So that's beautiful.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.120]   - And I know, Carolyn, you talk also about resiliency.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   So what do you mean by that when you say
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.760]   that that's a focus that you work on with clients?
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   What does that mean?
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.080]   - So to me, you can never predict what's going to happen.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.480]   And I talk about complex adaptive system science,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.160]   and that's basically we don't know what we don't know.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   And our goal in our practice is not for people
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.840]   to have this end game of a certain amount of money
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.780]   at a certain time.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.000]   It's to make sure that they have enough savings,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.040]   emergency funds, and that they're saving enough
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.720]   for the future that no matter what life throws them,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.360]   they're gonna be resilient and ready for that.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.160]   And that's, you look at the studies on regret,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   and our number, the other thing we try to get people to do
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.720]   is is there anything, if you didn't do it,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.880]   you'd have regret?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.720]   And so when people have less regret
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.900]   and something bad happens,
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.200]   they're actually more resilient
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.240]   and able to weather that bad thing happening more easily.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   So focusing on gratitude builds resiliency.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   Focusing on relationships build resiliency.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760]   So it's more than just money.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.940]   It's making certain you're living fully in the moment
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.200]   so when the world falls apart
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.800]   that you're gonna have less regret
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.040]   and be better able to weather it.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.720]   And one thing I always say to people,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.920]   and you talked about anxiety.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.680]   For me, I always ask myself when something bad has happened,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   she's heard me say this before and people gross out,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.880]   will I be able to wipe my butt?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.800]   Because if you can wipe your butt,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.000]   it means your brain works, your hands work,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.760]   and that you're gonna get through this.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.200]   So just step back and think, is this really the worst case?
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.560]   And most of the time it's not.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.400]   And when you can recognize that,
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.040]   it lets you be able to weather
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.720]   whatever's happening a little bit better.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.760]   - Related to being able to weather tough times,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.640]   what are some of the financial things
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.240]   that bogal heads should be doing
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   that maybe they aren't doing?
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.760]   Do you wanna address that, John?
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.720]   - Yeah, I really like what Harry is doing
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   in simplifying his finances,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   because I think one thing that folks often ignore
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.080]   when choosing the more complicated approach,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   having multiple accounts to get a signup bonus
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.440]   or chasing the highest yield,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.240]   is that assuming there's no downside to that strategy.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.860]   And there is a downside, it's complexity.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.240]   And if you don't do what you need to do right,
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   then you might just shoot yourself in the foot
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   and not get the benefit of all that complexity
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.760]   in the first place.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.480]   And then to speak to the theme of Paula Pant,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.000]   yes, you can afford anything but not everything.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.200]   So if you're using your energy to chase the highest yield
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.520]   on a savings account or a CD,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.860]   that means you're not doing something else.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.440]   Human energy, time, attention is limited.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.920]   So you can only do a few things well.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.800]   Are you gonna do it to chase the highest yield
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.160]   or are you gonna do it to make sure
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.960]   your estate planning is done?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.600]   A lot of time folks come to me when working with me
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.640]   and they wanna talk about how to manage taxes
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.380]   when selling their concentrated Apple stock position.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.360]   And I understand that can be an important point to them,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.120]   but that can be so largely irrelevant
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.680]   if they haven't done something like their estate planning,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   have enough umbrella insurance, for example.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   So yes, we love investing, it's so sexy and interesting,
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.640]   and we hate taxes and we wanna manage those,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.720]   but often they're not always the most important thing
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.160]   that we can be thinking about.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.040]   - Right, so this goes to what Paula was saying
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.640]   about the areas we may be avoidant of,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.680]   and sometimes they are emotionally difficult too.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.720]   Some of the things you have to wrestle with
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.440]   in making your estate planning documents,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.840]   all the dire scenarios you have to talk about
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.780]   and things you have to think about.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.420]   - Yeah, just one thing to add.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.640]   Financial planning is a broad field,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.160]   but on Bogleheads we spend 95% of the time
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   talking about investing, which is one piece of it,
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.880]   and the other 5% is taxes.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.400]   That's what we talk about.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.760]   We spend almost no time talking about estate planning
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.960]   or insurance, even though those are so critical,
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   and that happens all the time.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.180]   People come to me and they wanna do this deep dive
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.520]   on Roth conversions, and it's, well, we can do that,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.260]   but there's six other things that are such high priority,
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.840]   and you don't have these boxes checked off yet.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.700]   And basic estate planning documents,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.240]   you don't have disability insurance,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.820]   but you're still definitely not financially independent.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.480]   I mean, whatever it is, there's so much more
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.760]   to financial planning than your asset allocation,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.020]   and on Bogleheads we just spend so much time
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.760]   talking about just a few things.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   - I couldn't agree more, Mike,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.620]   and I have this conversation all the time
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.720]   with individuals who say, I need a financial advisor,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.120]   and so I'll listen to them and I'll be like,
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.000]   kinda sounds like you need a financial planner,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.360]   especially when I'm moving in Boglehead circles.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   And I have to say it's kind of a tough sell
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   about why, they're so focused on the investment piece,
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.360]   they have questions there, and they really underrate
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.880]   the financial planning piece.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   So I would say, if you go into it, my guess is,
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.960]   many of you probably need financial planning
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   more than you need investment advice.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.600]   You may need both, and sort of the counter to that is,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   if you're meeting advisors and their main selling point
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.240]   is I'm gonna do this, this, and this for your portfolio,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.320]   and they're not talking about financial planning,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.560]   they're serving you in a very limited way,
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.160]   and many advisors still style themselves in this fashion.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.680]   And if they're charging you a very low fee
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.040]   to do that investment piece, that's one thing,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.520]   but many of them are charging the full 1% AUM
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.120]   for something that looks to me an awful lot
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.920]   like just sort of investment management,
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.280]   and they're ignoring the financial planning piece,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.960]   or might be doing a few things around the margins.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.040]   So I just find there's a mismatch
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.480]   in terms of what people think they need,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   and what I believe they need,
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.160]   and I think they need more financial planning.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.960]   - And the one thing I wanna really add,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.120]   to me the most important question you have to ask yourself
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.880]   is what is the goal of your money?
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.600]   The money is the tool, it should not be the object.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.360]   And I've talked, I have loved this conference,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.480]   and so many of you have come up and talked to me,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.320]   and I can tell you most of you
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.040]   don't really know the goal for your money.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   And when you understand what you need, why you need it,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.280]   then it makes it much easier to create a financial plan
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   that actually serves you well
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.840]   to create a great life for yourself,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.800]   'cause that's what you're trying to do.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.440]   - Yeah, just echoing one thing Christine said
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.600]   about financial planning versus investment management.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.560]   Literally, I checked in on the forum Thursday night,
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.440]   very recently, and there was a post discussing John,
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.320]   actually, discussing John and Rick,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.280]   and someone said, "Well, I just don't see
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.080]   "how John could possibly do anything better
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.400]   "and beat a Vanguard balance index fund,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.040]   "and how that would be worth the fees."
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   And it's like, you're exactly missing the point.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.640]   The fact that you think that that is
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.080]   what a financial planner does,
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.200]   is try to beat a Vanguard balance fund,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.400]   tells me that there's almost for sure
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.080]   some things in your financial planning picture
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.200]   that you're not looking at,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.400]   and that you actually would benefit
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.720]   from working with John or somebody else.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.680]   - I think we'll shift to retirement a little bit.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.480]   So I will say I am partway through
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.000]   Christine's wonderful book.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.560]   I am reading it just as Jonathan Clements says
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.360]   in the introduction, with a pen.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.400]   I am underlying quite a lot.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   So Christine, I want to ask you to share with us
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   some of the lessons in the book,
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.760]   either things that resonate with you personally,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.920]   or lessons you think don't get enough attention.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.400]   - Yeah, thanks, Karen.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.600]   So the book, people may be surprised,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.360]   is not all financial.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.720]   It's about half or maybe more non-financial.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   So it's a lot about having a vision for retirement,
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.080]   picking up on Jordan Grumet,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.960]   the idea of having purpose,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.240]   if you got purpose through work,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.040]   just making sure that you're having something else
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.520]   that gives you purpose when and if you retire from work.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.000]   The book, I should explain for people who don't know,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.880]   each chapter is an interview
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.160]   about how to do some aspect of retirement planning.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.040]   And the contributors are well-represented
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.000]   at this conference.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So Jordan Grumet does a discussion with me,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   Mike Piper, Carolyn McClanahan,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.180]   Mike on taxes, Carolyn on healthcare.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.240]   But we do cover a lot of non-financial ground,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.120]   because I have to say,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.320]   as I've kind of moved along in my life,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   I feel like I've got the financial piece well in hand.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.400]   Like, there are always things I could do better.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   But the allocation that makes,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.160]   that is just more important to me at this life stage
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.640]   is my time on earth allocations.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.560]   Like, what decisions am I making with this precious life?
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   I have a friend right now who is about my age,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.880]   dying in hospice with ovarian cancer,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.520]   and a healthy, aggressively healthy person.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.600]   And so these things can just come up
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.000]   and very quickly turn everything around.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.440]   So that's what I wanted the book to be,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.800]   is sort of like, you have this wonderful life,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   what will you do to maximize
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.360]   however many years you have left?
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.200]   And so that was something I wanted
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.760]   to bring out loud and clear.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   So we talk about relationships, purpose, certainly.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.840]   Perhaps the role of working in some fashion longer.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.400]   Scott Burns, who was our speaker last night,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.440]   night said something to me, he's not in the book,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.880]   but he said something to me in another conversation.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.960]   He had tried to retire, and he said,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.280]   he was stocking shelves in the food pantry,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   and he said, even though he enjoyed that work,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.320]   he said, I took a step back and realized
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.120]   that my highest, best use in this world
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.920]   was probably not stocking food pantry shelves,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.320]   even though I liked meeting people
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.880]   and I wanted to continue to do it,
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.480]   it was probably going back to some version
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.600]   of my life's work, the work that he did
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.840]   with financial education in his column.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.320]   And so I guess, for me, that's something
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.520]   I've been thinking about, and I would urge
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.920]   all of you to think about, is there an aspect
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.360]   of your work, or maybe something
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.080]   that you didn't explore in your work,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.680]   that you wanna carry forward later in life?
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.400]   I'm hoping people will come away
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.040]   with some impetus to think through those things.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.920]   - Oh, one of the things that many people talk about
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.480]   as they're thinking about retirement
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.000]   is where they wanna live.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.960]   So I know, Harry, you had shared
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.480]   that you've lived in five houses in three states
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.680]   in the last six years after leaving
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.320]   your full-time job in California.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.840]   Tell us a little bit about that adventure
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.440]   and lessons you've learned along the way.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.040]   - Sure, I worked in San Jose, California
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.120]   for about 20 years, quit my job in 2018.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.720]   We moved to Nevada, Reno, Nevada in 2020,
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.920]   right before the pandemic.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.880]   Moved again in 2021 to our current place,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.400]   Midway, Utah, about one hour east of Salt Lake City.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.520]   Out of all those moves, I think my biggest takeaway
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.080]   is, A, you don't have to move.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.680]   News media publish a lot of lists,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.200]   best places to retire in America.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.120]   They create the impression that everybody
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.280]   has to move, or everybody's supposed to move.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.360]   If you have your family, you have your kids
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.040]   who grew up in the area, they're still there.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.600]   You have your network, you have your activities,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.320]   don't have to move.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.240]   If you do move, I would say have a strong,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.000]   non-financial reason for your move.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.080]   You wanna move closer to your family,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.400]   or for us, it's activities.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.000]   We like skiing and hiking, so we picked Reno, Nevada
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.840]   for skiing and hiking near Lake Tahoe area,
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.040]   and then we found a better place in Midway, Utah,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   and that's where we currently are.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.080]   Don't move for financial reasons.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.160]   Don't move because of cost of living or taxes.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.280]   So when we moved to Nevada, people say,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.380]   "Hey, you moved to Nevada, no state tax.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.240]   "You must have saved a lot of taxes."
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.800]   The first year that we moved there,
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.520]   we saved $1,000 in California state tax.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.720]   So, and then we moved to Utah.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.200]   Utah's state tax is higher than California state taxes
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.880]   because it's a flat rate versus progressive.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.160]   So move because you like somewhere,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.320]   and there's some activities there.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   Don't move because of cost of living or taxes.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.240]   Living comes first before costs.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.200]   - I have two important points to that.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   A lot of people wanna move to where their kids are.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.500]   A high percentage of kids move
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.280]   after you move to where they are.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   And so be careful about that.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.240]   The second thing, I have seen this over and over,
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.000]   think about healthcare where you move.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.640]   Do not retire in rural areas.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   Rural areas are struggling with good healthcare.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.280]   If you need long-term care, long-term care services,
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.120]   it's almost impossible to get.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.320]   So be very careful that wherever you do move,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.680]   that you know there's a good healthcare community there
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.360]   and people that are gonna help you as you age.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.120]   - Yeah, I guess it depends on your age.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   I'm in my 50s, so I trust whatever illness I have,
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.960]   anywhere in a good-sized metropolitan area,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.480]   doctors can treat me.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.120]   But if I develop some rare disease,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.800]   I have to live close to a Mayo Clinic
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.400]   or a Cleveland Clinic
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.240]   or that sort of caliber of medical facilities.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.520]   Yeah, definitely that's a consideration.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   - My book has a chapter on housing
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.800]   and I talk to Mark Miller
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   about all the different dimensions of housing,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   including home equity and potentially unlacking home equity.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.480]   But Mark made a really astute point
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.400]   about downsizing, like getting into
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.080]   a more age-appropriate home,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   sort of separate from the relocation decision.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.040]   And his point was like,
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.760]   there's never a better time
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   than just when you're embarking on retirement.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.040]   You'll never be more in the driver's seat
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.680]   with the decision-making about where,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.840]   how that move gets executed,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   how your possessions get disposed of.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.000]   And his point, I mean, many of us have been through this
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.400]   with older parents passing away
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.200]   where you're in charge of cleaning out
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.280]   a very large and full house.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.400]   It's not a great gift to get from your parents, I will say.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.560]   So, you know, if you can kind of get in front of
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.840]   that decision-making and that process,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.640]   I think that that redounds to the benefit
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.640]   of everyone's well-being, yours and your family members.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.920]   - I wanna remind everyone, if you have questions,
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.240]   please write them on the little pieces of paper,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   Alan is walking around and he'll gather them up for us.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.720]   I wanted to turn the conversation a bit
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.480]   to charitable giving.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.880]   So, we've talked about some tax strategies
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.920]   related to charitable giving,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.240]   that it can be efficient to leave tax-deferred IRAs
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   to charities or give appreciated securities
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.320]   to a donor-advised fund for later granting.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.080]   And I'm wondering just in sort of a bigger picture way,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.360]   are there conversations that you have with clients
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.480]   or questions that we should be asking ourselves
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.160]   about how charitable giving fits into our goals?
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.840]   - At the risk of getting into the investing section,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.600]   I can see charitable giving as an opportunity
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.240]   to clean up one's portfolio.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.040]   A lot of times folks will come to me
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.000]   with some stuff they bought themselves
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.120]   or maybe some old employer stock,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   or often it's gonna be that 1% advisor portfolio
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.040]   that they've fired the advisor
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.640]   and now they're left with this dumpster fire
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.360]   of an investment portfolio.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.040]   And so that can be a good time to prioritize
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.080]   getting rid of those things in a tax-efficient manner,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.000]   giving it to a donor-advised fund, et cetera.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.040]   - Yeah, I'm not QCD ages yet,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.080]   so before QCD, donor-advised fund
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.000]   is probably the best vehicle.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.320]   But I would suggest if you use a donor-advised fund,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.280]   use it more as a pass-through.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.080]   Don't hold money there.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.760]   Donate to donor-advised funds
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   and then disperse the money right away.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.600]   - I sort of disagree with that.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.680]   It depends on the situation.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.200]   I mean, we've had clients with long-time donor-advised funds
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.960]   that are invested and they've done the,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.160]   it's been fun for them that they've grown
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.320]   that pie that they're giving to charity,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.200]   and they're giving along the way.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.520]   But, you know, like I talked about the golden age
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.440]   of tax planning and retirement from 60 to 70 yesterday,
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.160]   and we'll do a nice lump sum too of appreciated stock,
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.480]   cleaning up portfolio like you said,
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.200]   that we know what their charitable intentions are
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.560]   for the next 10 years,
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.000]   and now we've been able to do other nice things
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.520]   like get rid of other appreciated stock
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.600]   or do Roth conversions or IRA distributions.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.720]   So it can, yes, there is a fee
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.640]   with having a charitable gift fund,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.040]   but it's not that high.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.240]   I mean, well, Fidelity is what we use,
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.680]   and it's not that high to have that donor gift fund.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.600]   Whoops, lost your mic.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.480]   - I died, and my battery's, my battery might be dead.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.080]   - And so, I mean, every situation's different.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.120]   And so just make sure that you're thinking through
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.480]   both short-term and long-term
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.320]   about what your goals are charitably
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.720]   and doing it in the most tax-efficient manner.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.160]   - I will say, I kind of agree with Harry, though.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.880]   I do not understand why the fees are so high.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   If I'm putting some plain vanilla security in there,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.400]   like employer stock from a large company,
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.280]   why am I having this, is it 50 basis points
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   or something, drag on,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.960]   I don't understand what the fees are about.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.360]   - So, you know, when you give money to,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.840]   so when you put it into Fidelity Charitable,
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.480]   the fees are not 50 basis points.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.760]   It's actually a lot lower.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.240]   The reason the fees are there is because they have to check
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.520]   and make sure the charities are qualified charities.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.280]   So it's more, it's a logistical thing.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   Your stock is gonna be sold,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.320]   and that's gonna be invested in a diversified portfolio.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.600]   So, you know, there's a fee for that.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   I don't think it's, I mean, let me,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.360]   I think Fidelity's 35 basis points, so it's not,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.520]   and it goes down, so it's not that high,
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   but that's what you pay for, for that tax efficiency.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.600]   - A thing I didn't know about donor advised funds
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.240]   until becoming the treasurer of a non-profit organization,
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.560]   Schwab Charitable, they don't have direct deposit.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.680]   They just send you a check every time.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.160]   What the heck?
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.760]   (laughing)
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.440]   Yeah, Fidelity Vanguard, yeah, it's just, anyway.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.480]   Small little tidbit.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.840]   I love donor advised funds.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.440]   One thing I do like to point out,
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.000]   because some people, financial services companies,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.280]   promote them as this tax strategy.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.000]   They are helpful, but they are an administrative tool.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.840]   Like, any tax savings you would have had
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.320]   from donating to a donor advised fund,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.880]   it's exactly, literally precisely the same
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.840]   as if you just donated to some other charity.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.560]   They're helpful from an administrative point of view
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.320]   because you can do, like we were just talking about
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.960]   where you can donate some all at once,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.480]   get some tax savings right now,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.760]   and then spread that out over some years.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.160]   Or useful if you want to keep yourself anonymous
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.360]   so you don't end up on mailing lists.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.520]   Also convenient if you have your Vanguard account
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.600]   and Vanguard charitable account,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.200]   so you can just add your appreciated stock
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.600]   to the charitable fund, whereas not every organization
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.080]   is set up for you to give them shares of stock.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.360]   So, lots of administrative benefits,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.600]   but it's just the same thing from a tax point of view.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.800]   - And I'm gonna add one thing to that.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.360]   I find that when clients set up a charitable giving fund,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.040]   and I don't know, I only use Fidelity,
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.600]   I haven't used any other ones.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.720]   It's so easy to give away money,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.800]   so they become more charitable,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.240]   which is, for a lot of our clients, it's a good thing.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.440]   And I actually have a Fidelity donor advised fund,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   and I get on there, and it keeps this big list
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   of all the shares, it's like, oh, I gotta give money to them,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.840]   and you just go, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.040]   And so, I don't know whether that's good or bad.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.960]   If you have a client with spending issues, it's bad,
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   but if you have a client that needs to be more charitable,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.880]   it's a good thing.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   - I'm gonna turn to a different topic.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.440]   So, we're hearing every day, cyber frauds,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.560]   data breaches, all sorts of scams out there.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.600]   Are there steps that people should take
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.120]   to protect themselves?
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.520]   Asking for a friend, should I finally do
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.120]   those credit freezes that people talk about?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.960]   - Yes.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:20.480]   - Any other steps I should be doing besides that?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   - Yeah, freezer credit, freezer spouse's credit,
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.880]   freezer kid's credit.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:32.840]   Gosh, be very suspicious of any text messages you get.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   Don't click on any links on any text messages.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.000]   If a financial institution calls you, or texts you,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.720]   and says there's an issue, do not respond via that medium.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.760]   Say, thank you for the information, hang up,
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.960]   and then go to the website and contact them
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.600]   via the website, via the phone number
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.080]   that's on the website.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   Moreover, do not Google an organization's phone number,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.880]   'cause that is a common scam now.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.120]   The scammers are getting really good at SEO.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.160]   So, if you're looking for a financial institution's
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.280]   phone number, and you failed a Vanguard or whatever,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.440]   and you Google it as opposed to going to the site directly,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.280]   the search tools may pull from a scammer's website,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.600]   and then you'll be connected directly to a scammer.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   So, always connect with the organization
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.280]   directly on your own, even if that organization
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.020]   supposedly reaches out to you.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.800]   - I would find having fewer accounts,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.880]   or fewer institutions help.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.600]   So, if I get a scam message saying my Chase account
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.520]   has some problems, I don't have a Chase account.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.640]   So, if I only have one account,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.760]   then those messages will tend to have less effect.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.680]   In this realm, I find usually brokers
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.160]   have better security than banks,
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.240]   because they deal with large sum of money.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.600]   So, that's why I use a broker account for my cash flow.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.320]   - One piece of feedback we had on this conference
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.800]   is that this would be a good future session.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.680]   So, I have taken that away, how to protect yourself,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.760]   you know, all dimensions of your financial life
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.600]   from fraudsters.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   I think that would be a great next session.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.240]   Couple things I would add.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.040]   Password manager is a really good practice
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.120]   if you haven't set one up.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.640]   It's a little bit of a pain to set it up,
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.560]   but once it's up and running, it's not too difficult.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.480]   And then, I just wanted to mention,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.320]   we did, for our podcast, a conversation with Kathy Stokes,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   who is Director of Fraud Prevention for AARP.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.140]   And I asked, so where is sort of the epicenter
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.600]   of financial fraud right now?
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.640]   And her answer was very clear, crypto, crypto, crypto.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.440]   And she said that there is so much scamming going on
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.400]   in the crypto space.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.840]   So, for those of you who are crypto curious,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.240]   after Matt Hogan and Rick Ferry talked yesterday,
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.920]   just really be on your guard in that space.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.740]   Not everyone is out to scam people in the crypto space,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.200]   but I think scams are alive and well there,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.000]   and it's certainly less regulated,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.240]   so you just need to be super careful.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.680]   - One thing I wanna add,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.880]   not that I'm pushing financial advisors,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.640]   but we get, as an independent RIA,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.980]   we sometimes get people calling us,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.160]   trying to impersonate a client to try to get money.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.920]   And we know every client,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.440]   and it's interesting the stories we get told,
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.420]   but we catch it right away.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.280]   We have people try to email us
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   when they've hacked into a client's email,
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.600]   email us pretending they're a client,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.100]   but we know our clients so well,
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.840]   and we have processes in place to call the client,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.720]   and then as soon as we recognize
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.200]   that a client's been compromised,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.680]   we freeze everything, we notify the custodian.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.320]   So, that is, especially as you get older,
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.500]   the scams are getting hard, just amazing what they do.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.720]   So, that is one benefit as you get older
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.680]   and maybe facing some cognitive decline
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.140]   of working with an advisor.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.340]   Again, not that I'm pushing, but it's another layer of help.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.500]   - So, we've talked some, Carolyn talked yesterday
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.780]   about getting a less involved spouse
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.100]   more involved in the finances.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.980]   Mike did a great session on that last year.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.180]   Harry, when we spoke before this session,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.520]   he said something that really resonated for me,
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.980]   'cause it would be like the kind of thing
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.860]   that I would be guilty of.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.220]   Just writing down a complex system really doesn't help.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   So, tell us some more things that would be helpful
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.400]   in getting a less financially involved spouse
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.200]   ready to be more involved if necessary.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.920]   - Sure, I read Mike's excellent book,
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.080]   "After the Death of Your Spouse," or something like that.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.200]   My biggest impression from reading the book
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.640]   is it's a little late by that time.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.600]   So, you wanna get your spouse involved,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.200]   or partner, get them on the same page,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.760]   keeping them informed.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.440]   Part of the battle is just know what you have, right?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.740]   So, Mike talks a lot in the book
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.160]   about how to find out where you have your accounts.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.200]   It's a little late there.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.040]   You don't wanna leave a detective worker
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.800]   for your spouse after you die.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.360]   So, it's better to keep your spouse informed.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.520]   And the best way to do that is while you're still here.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.880]   And from my writing, a lot of people talk about
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.460]   having a death binder or a letter of instructions.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.960]   To me, that's less helpful,
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.840]   because whenever I write something,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.240]   I always forget some basic,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.600]   because the knowledge level is different.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.720]   So, what you deem, of course, assumptions,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.680]   you have a lot of assumptions while you write down things,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.360]   a lot of things that you didn't realize
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.060]   that's needed for your spouse to understand.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.140]   So, if you make your system simple,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.440]   then you can involve your spouse right now,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.840]   then you don't have to write that instruction.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.800]   Or better yet, have your spouse write down your system,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   and then he or she is writing in his or her own notes
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.720]   and language, and then he or she knows
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.480]   what should be written down.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.180]   - That's why we also have clients do yearly,
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.720]   what we call yearly audits with the spouse
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.520]   of them sitting down and going through things.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.880]   And we always say, make your spouse pay the bills,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.960]   make your spouse look at the investments,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.080]   make sure they can log into everything.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.000]   And just taking, it takes an hour or two each year
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.760]   to make sure that they're doing it.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.280]   And like I talked about yesterday,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.160]   make sure they know how to get into your phone,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.480]   that you don't just have a thumbprint on there
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.080]   that use the same similar passwords
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.020]   so you guys know how to get into each other's phones.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.820]   So, there's lots you can do,
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.300]   it just, you have to be intentional about doing it,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.460]   and it saves a ton of anguish
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.860]   when something actually happens.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.900]   - So, I want to segue into a related question
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.100]   from the audience.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.440]   If one spouse is the bogal head
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.340]   and the other is less financially savvy,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.220]   what should I look for in a financial planner
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.060]   to help guide my spouse after I'm gone?
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.340]   - I think it's, to a very significant extent,
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.220]   the same things that you would just look for
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.060]   in a financial planner normally.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.020]   Is this a human being whom I trust?
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.540]   Do they have the levels and areas of expertise
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.740]   that are applicable to us?
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.780]   Because, again, financial planning is a broad field,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.340]   and so the financial planning that somebody needs
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.300]   in their 60s is different from in their 40s,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.540]   and it's different, again, from in their 80s.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.380]   So, do I trust this person?
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.820]   Do they have the areas of expertise that I need?
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.780]   And is the way that I would be compensating them
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   something that makes sense to me and that I can afford?
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.380]   - Do they have your same investment philosophy?
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.660]   That's key.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.380]   - And Rick Ferry once made the point
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.620]   that I've often thought about,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:05.420]   which is take that next step and introduce them preemptively
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.620]   if you've identified the person.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.200]   Just make sure that they click,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.820]   that your spouse is comfortable sharing information
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.780]   with that person.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.860]   Does he or she address the spouse who's not engaged?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.540]   All that interpersonal stuff I think is very important
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.780]   to do a check on just to make sure
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.460]   that the spouse has that comfort level.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.620]   - I wanna echo that point by both Rick and Christine
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.220]   and add it to not just your financial advisor,
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.700]   your financial planner, but your tax professional,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.180]   your estate planning attorney as well,
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.900]   any other trusted parties who your spouse
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.860]   is gonna turn to in that worst case.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.180]   - I don't have a financial advisor,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.260]   so I go back to simplicity.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.960]   If I make my system simple enough,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.580]   maybe my wife doesn't need a financial advisor.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:57.580]   So last year I had my wife do our taxes.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.940]   She opened up TurboTax.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.020]   I was sitting by her side.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.500]   She went through all the steps.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.300]   She wrote down the notes and she actually clicked a button
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.540]   to file the taxes.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.380]   So treat it like training a new hire.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.480]   Then make sure that she understands.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.380]   - Okay, so I had a client, I have a client.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.940]   Her husband was a CPA and he had colon cancer.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.020]   They were not clients at the time.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.820]   And he said, "You cannot hire a financial advisor
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.200]   "'cause you can't trust him.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.620]   "I have done this financial plan for you."
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.380]   He had this life, they were in their 50s,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.600]   they had this life plan and she was a smart woman,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.040]   but she just wasn't into investments.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.820]   And then the year after he died,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.780]   that's when the stock market fell apart.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.700]   And she was so upset and stressed
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.740]   because she didn't know how to deal with it.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.500]   So a friend of hers talked her into coming to us.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.860]   So you can't control your spouse from the grave.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.100]   And it's great to me that you're doing that,
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.340]   but still if they don't have the interest or inclination
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.140]   and they're gonna get old at some point and need help,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.500]   it's really good to make sure you have some sort of backup,
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   whether it's a savvy family member or an advisor,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.700]   but you can't control from the grave.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.340]   So don't try to teach them everything
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.420]   and think they're gonna do it
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.260]   'cause the plan's not gonna work out like you expect, okay?
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.220]   - Another question, my parents are 80.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.340]   They have a funded trust,
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.520]   a binder with all their financial home information,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.940]   their wills.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.660]   As they age and begin to decline mentally,
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.220]   what should I do to protect their financial legacy?
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.500]   Should they add me as a fiduciary?
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.640]   Should I get alerts on their accounts?
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.600]   What should I do?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.740]   - Well, you know, this is my love, a line of work.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.340]   So this needs to be a gradual process.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.940]   Especially for do-it-yourselfers,
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.140]   taking care of your money is a sense of purpose to you.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.800]   And so you don't wanna rip that
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.540]   from your parents away immediately.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.700]   You want to make it, so we first start off
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.060]   with financial transparency, not just with one person,
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.580]   but with the entire family,
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.320]   so that there's nobody worrying
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.900]   that somebody's trying to take advantage of other people.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.240]   And then as they have issues,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.220]   then you start having that look behind.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.940]   And so whether they're logging into your accounts,
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.180]   we use an e-money portal where everything gets scraped
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.220]   and is in one financial portal
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.160]   that the surrogate can look through
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.260]   to make sure everything looks good.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.440]   And then you might still let them write,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.180]   if they become more declining, let them write the bills,
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.740]   but don't let them send them in.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.540]   You check the bills before they get turned in.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.820]   The same with the tax return.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.900]   You know, to me, at that point,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.440]   maybe you should be getting an outside accountant.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.300]   And you've gotta make sure
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.700]   that you have that power of attorney document.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.460]   It depends on the estate issues.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.020]   It's easier to become a joint account holder
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.580]   for that checking account where the bills are paid,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.100]   even though that child who's the surrogate
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.740]   is gonna get that money.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.420]   If you don't have joint accounts and somebody dies,
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   then that account gets frozen.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.960]   And so, you know, there's pros and cons of joint account
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.420]   versus using a power of attorney,
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.120]   but you've got to figure out what's right for you,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.260]   but make it a gradual process.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.920]   And what ends up happening with a lot of older people
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.980]   is once they feel comfortable with whoever's taking over,
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.580]   they're like, "God, I'm happy not doing this,"
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.940]   and then they just let the child take over.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.660]   But again, you wanna keep transparency the whole way.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.080]   As we talked about yesterday,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.020]   90% of financial fraud is actually perpetrated
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.000]   by people who are close to you.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.140]   So that's why it's important to have transparency
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.620]   and multiple people involved.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.420]   - Carolyn, I have a question for you about that.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.100]   When my parents were declining,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.900]   I had full trading authority on all of their accounts.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.020]   Is that recommended or is that,
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.020]   and again, it depends on the relationship,
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.300]   but is that risky?
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.420]   - Risky in what way?
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.020]   - Risky in that you have to have complete and utter trust
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.060]   in that person you've given that authority to.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.220]   - Right, well, and so ideally, you know,
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.020]   you've got to trust somebody as you age.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.520]   So first off, it's important for everybody
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.140]   to be clear on their investment policy.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.380]   I see so many families
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.740]   not having an investment policy statement.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.740]   How is my money gonna be invested?
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.060]   And so if you have a younger child
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.060]   who has a different investment philosophy than you,
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.860]   that is dangerous.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.020]   If you have multiple, you know, multiple children
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.780]   that one person's doing it and the other ones don't know,
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.580]   that can cause some issues.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.820]   So you've got to trust in somebody.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.660]   And if you don't trust them from the beginning,
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.720]   and that's also why it's good to let this happen
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.620]   while your brain is still there
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.900]   so you can watch that surrogate in action
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.820]   and feel comfortable with what they're doing
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.560]   so that when you are losing it,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.260]   you know they're gonna do the right thing.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.580]   - I think we're gonna circle back to a couple of things
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.260]   a little bit more in the investment space.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.260]   From your point of view, this is very different,
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.980]   from your point of view, what's the true difference
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.460]   between Fidelity and Vanguard?
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.980]   Yes, Fidelity is privately owned,
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.820]   but is that a reason to move my entire Fidelity portfolio
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.660]   to Vanguard?
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.020]   - No, no, not at all.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.140]   To me, as an individual, you know, DIY investor,
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.940]   the differences are very minimal.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.900]   They all have the ability to build
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.460]   a low-cost, diversified, simple portfolio.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.700]   Like Rick said yesterday, at some of the firms
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.020]   you'll maybe get more incoming sales contact.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.840]   As vocal heads, hopefully you know that,
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.500]   you know, opt out, basically.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.380]   But no, they're all very, very fine
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.380]   in terms of almost all of the stuff that matters, really.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.640]   - Well, and the one thing, you just have to think of,
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.420]   they're both supermarkets.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.620]   You can pretty much buy anything you want there,
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.060]   so you can buy all the low-cost ETFs and stuff,
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.980]   and so it doesn't really matter.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.020]   They're the supermarkets.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.020]   So to me, you have to look at
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.140]   what's giving the better client service,
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.420]   and they all, I've been around so long,
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.380]   they all rotate when they stink, you know?
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   And so when you are working with them and they stink,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:40.700]   you complain, and a lot of times they fix it.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.260]   So for us, we use Fidelity 'cause they've done a good job.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.980]   Vanguard has gone through periods
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.220]   where they do a good job, doesn't,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.060]   but Fidelity's done that, too.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.820]   So you just gotta look at the platform,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.900]   what's comfortable to you,
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.140]   who's giving you the better service.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:02.020]   - If you're using a 60% stock, 40% bond portfolio,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.280]   it's gotten you to your number
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.580]   for a comfortable, confident retirement,
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.460]   does it make sense to be more aggressive with stocks,
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.140]   say, go up to 70% to try and earn more wealth?
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.620]   - Well, I'll be real quick.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.860]   It's like, what is, I said this earlier,
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.980]   what is the goal for your money?
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.180]   If you have a goal of trying to grow it,
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.140]   to leave it to your kids,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.900]   and you wanna take that risk
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.660]   that you're gonna either leave them more
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.100]   or you're gonna leave them less,
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.140]   then you can become more risky,
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.820]   but you gotta make sure you understand
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.060]   what are your goals for your money,
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.800]   do you have enough for yourself first,
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.880]   how much risk do you wanna take psychologically
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.660]   and financially for those goals?
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.480]   That should drive that decision.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.180]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.420]   I like when we agree.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.220]   - I think one mistake that I see folks make a lot
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.420]   when it comes to that stock/bond mix decision
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.140]   is looking at only the amount of risk
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.020]   they're taking that decision.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.620]   For example, hey, retirement's well-funded,
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.820]   so I wanna invest more aggressively in stocks.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.740]   Okay, yes, maybe it makes sense to take risks there,
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.220]   but think holistically about all the risks in your life
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.740]   and if you wanna be taking risks in all those other places.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.700]   So often what I see, for example, is okay,
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.180]   yes, I'm fully funded for retirement,
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.740]   I'm gonna invest in more stock funds
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.540]   compared to bond funds for that reason,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.860]   and again, that might be reasonable,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.340]   but also consider, do you have a aggressive overweight
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.380]   relative to international?
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.500]   Because that's more risk.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.060]   Are you holding a bunch of concentrated employer stock
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.760]   'cause you don't wanna sell it 'cause of taxes?
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.240]   Okay, that's more risk there.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.340]   Do you have additional money
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.520]   in a non-qualified deferred comp plan of that same company?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.900]   That's more risk yet.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.980]   Have you decided to self-fund for long-term care insurance?
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.280]   That's more risk there.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.780]   So if deciding to be aggressive
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.020]   in the portfolio aspect of your life,
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.340]   look at everything holistically and decide,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.660]   should I also be aggressive in all these other places too?
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.940]   - Just to follow up on that real quick.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.980]   So at the time when people feel like,
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.760]   eh, yay, I'm fully funded,
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.060]   they're also, you're also getting older, right,
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.340]   as the years go by, and so that may,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.140]   as you get closer to needing the money,
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.820]   and of course it gets to Carolyn's point
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.340]   about what is the goal, but if your goal is to retire,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.200]   you, you know, your portfolio may be larger,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.840]   you can spare more, but you also do need to de-risk.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.700]   I would say this is the main thing I encounter
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.880]   when I talk to older adults about their portfolios.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.420]   It is a tough sell getting people to de-risk appropriately,
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.240]   and you guys would know about this as well,
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.160]   but it, stocks have been great,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.440]   and it is very difficult to encourage people
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.480]   to step away from them.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.080]   Bonds haven't made an especially great case
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.780]   for themselves over the past decade,
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.560]   but I do think, you know, as you get close to draw down,
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.980]   you need more bonds, you need more cash,
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.100]   you still need stocks, but you really do need that balance
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.840]   at that life stage more than ever.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.820]   - Is there an advantage to converting
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:05.660]   Vanguard Mutual Fund shares to their ETF equivalents?
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:10.780]   - There can be an advantage if you're holding
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.940]   them in Fidelity accounts.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.980]   Converting them to ETFs allow you
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.880]   to buy Vanguard ETFs at no fee.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.820]   Fidelity does charge a fee if you buy Vanguard Mutual Funds.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.260]   They don't charge fees on selling,
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.920]   they only charge fees on buying.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.540]   - Okay, I think we are gonna wrap up here.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.040]   Thank you all for so many great questions.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.780]   Thank you to our panel.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
