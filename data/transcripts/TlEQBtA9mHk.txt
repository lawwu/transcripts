[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Pastor John, how much of joy in God is willed by the Christian, and how much of
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.160]   it is just given as a gift from God? And how do you balance that distinction
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.520]   between willing the joy and receiving joy as a gift from God? That's a great
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.400]   question, absolutely great question, because I think we err on both sides of
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.440]   this fence. That is, we become willpower people, and we become passive waiting
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.480]   people, and there's no doubt that authentic joy cannot be immediately
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.720]   willed. In other words, if you're feeling rotten, you can't say, "Not a problem. I'll
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.840]   just decide to be happy. Boom, I'm happy." That doesn't happen. And people
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   draw the inference from that that you don't ever try to will joy, but that's
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.320]   not true. You should do the kinds of things you can do to put yourself in
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.120]   the way of joy. I think when Paul says, "Sow to the Spirit," I've tried to figure out for
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.400]   years, what does he mean, "Sow to the flesh and sow to the Spirit?" And I think
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.480]   sowing to the Spirit means taking steps to put yourself in the way of the
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:31.080]   Spirit's activity and pray. So when the psalmist says, "Open my eyes that I may
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   behold wonderful things out of your law," and then he prays, "Satisfy me in the
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.500]   morning with your steadfast love," clearly he is willing that something happen which
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.960]   isn't now happening. He doesn't see wonderful things in the Word of God. He's
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.120]   asking God to show him. He doesn't feel satisfaction. He's asking God to give it,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.720]   and in that sense he's willing to pursue the satisfaction. So there are
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.960]   remarkable things you can do with your brain to put out of your mind things
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.800]   that are self-defeating, put in your mind things that are joy-producing, but in the
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.880]   end, joy is a gift. It's a fruit of the Holy Spirit. So I'm going to encourage
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   everybody to realize how helpless we are to have true spiritual joy, and therefore
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.360]   to expect it to be a spontaneous work of the Spirit, that's one side, and I'm going
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.000]   to pursue everybody, do everything you can by way of using the means of grace
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.600]   in order to awaken, kindle, and quicken, and pursue that joy. Thank you, Pastor John,
