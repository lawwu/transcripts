[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.260]   because you are an entrepreneur,
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.920]   you are at least a modest personal finance aficionado.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.020]   - Aficionado, oh wow, that's a new word for me.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.300]   - And you and your wife have seven young children.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.360]   Your eldest is now?
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.400]   - Just turned 10, two weeks ago.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.440]   - Seven children, 10 and under.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.940]   So your life is an absolute joy and an absolute craziness.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.780]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.600]   - I'm sure.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.440]   - Also joy, yeah.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.540]   - I started with joy.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.740]   - I started with joy.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.220]   But I wanted to have you on
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.080]   to talk about entrepreneurship and business
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.220]   as well as, of course, how family integrates into that.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.060]   - Yeah.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.260]   - Begin with sharing a little bit of your story.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.820]   You and your wife have been married how long?
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.060]   - 13, 2006, what year is it now, 2019.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.100]   So, ooh.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.940]   - 13 years.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.500]   - 13 years, okay, that's what I thought.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.300]   See, I'm not a good math aficionado.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.140]   (laughing)
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.240]   - That's all right, that's all right.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.700]   And when did your business
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.180]   and entrepreneurship journey begin?
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.300]   - Yeah, I was a youth and family worker
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.880]   at a church for like 12 years.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.240]   And that ended very poorly.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.320]   We had a lot of bad things kind of going on in the church
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.540]   and it ended up with 10 of us being fired on staff.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.720]   It was a sizable church.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.680]   And so I was number nine out of the 10.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.120]   And losing your job when you need to make some money,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.600]   you know, it's a quick,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   you gotta figure something out real fast.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.600]   And the only thing I had was my blog.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.440]   - Okay.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.000]   - It was a really small town in Minnesota.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.200]   There's no other career opportunities or anything there.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.460]   So all I had was my blog.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.240]   And I was like, I need to turn this into something.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.560]   But this was, at this point it was 2010 or 11
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.760]   or something like that.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.400]   And so yeah, it was nothing like getting fired
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.720]   and losing your income that kind of forced you
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   to kind of figure something out.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.520]   - And you would have had one baby at the time then?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.360]   - We had two at the time.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.180]   - Two, okay.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.320]   - Yeah, so I guess it was maybe like 2011
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.160]   or I don't remember exactly.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   - There's nothing like getting fired
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.120]   and losing your job when you have two little babies at home.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   - Yeah, and they gave me some severance,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   but it expired on Christmas day.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.960]   So you're like, oh, Merry Christmas, everybody.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   - Right, right.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.320]   - So yeah, so I started, I spent a few years
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   just kind of living off the blog
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.960]   and turned that into an income really quick
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.120]   'cause I didn't have a choice.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.040]   And it was a lot of fire under your butt to get that going.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.940]   So I did that and then still looking
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.160]   for other youth ministry gigs and stuff,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.120]   but there wasn't anything that was like,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   either I was really just trigger shy
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   or whatever, gun shy or something, I don't know.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.240]   But eventually I took a job up in Cincinnati
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.280]   doing YouTube strategy for a company.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.720]   I have already been, like our YouTube channel
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.600]   is already reaching like a million people a month.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.880]   - Because you and your wife had started
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.080]   kind of an informal vlog.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   - Yeah, it started off when I was in grad school.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.160]   I just wanted to introduce her to my family
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.060]   across the country.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.840]   And so we put together little videos
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   and that was like 2006 before vlogging was a thing.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   And so we do those.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.320]   And so the channel was growing.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.900]   We're reaching about a million people a month.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.200]   And so I started doing YouTube strategy for this company
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.280]   and had a lot of fun with that.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.520]   And then when the company's like,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.560]   hey, we're no longer going to be doing YouTube strategy
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.960]   for our, they had a video production house.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.040]   So they were like, we're not doing strategy
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.680]   for our clients anymore.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.960]   Like, yeah, six months and then you'll,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   you won't be working here anymore.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I'm like, man, losing another job.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.680]   And so at that point I was like,
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.540]   let me just do for myself what I've been teaching
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.320]   other people to do on YouTube.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.200]   And so I started Video Creators.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.680]   I created the channel on January 2nd, 2013.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.320]   My last day at that company of having like a real job
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.460]   was June 15th, 2013.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.700]   And within that six month period,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.360]   like I knew I had to take this from zero
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.080]   to a full-time income in six months.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.620]   And so I got started and with, by the time my job was,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.700]   yeah, by the time my job ended,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.200]   it was generating $10,000 a month.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.920]   And I was like, oh, I should have quit my job
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.840]   a long time ago, you know?
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   But I think for me, it was like,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.400]   no one in my background, my family,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.120]   on my wife's side or mine have like started
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.520]   known businesses, you know?
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.480]   And I think it was just like a combination
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.120]   of being in the right place at the right time.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.480]   It's also a combination of having like a personality
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   that really likes to solve big problems.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.360]   And YouTube stuff was a big one,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.060]   especially back in the day.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.120]   And also just being like, I can't,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.560]   I'm not gonna go look for another job.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.960]   I don't wanna do that again.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.360]   And then it actually paid a lot better.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.680]   So now today, here we are a few years later,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.000]   and there's 11 people who work for me on my team
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.720]   at Video Creators, and we just love working with people
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.600]   to help them master the YouTube platform
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.360]   so they can ultimately reach people
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.160]   and change their lives with the messages
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.920]   and the businesses that they're growing.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   So been a lot of success.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.880]   We've done 14 billion views and 61 million subscribers
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.020]   for our clients so far, all organically on the platform.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.400]   We've done strategy for Disney, Warner Brothers,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.160]   eBay, Budweiser, HBO, like a lot of big brands,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.720]   all the way down to people who are like,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.180]   how do we just get started?
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.260]   You know, whether it's just like the stay at home mom
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.620]   or a business owner or a brand or just a hobby creator.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.180]   Like we love working with all of them.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.660]   So been a lot of fun.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.820]   - Now I know that in your journey,
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.060]   personal finance and good financial management
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.040]   is part of the story that you share.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.020]   I think Dave Ramsey was a major influence.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.860]   - Yeah, for sure, yeah.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.020]   - How'd you get connected with Dave Ramsey and his teaching?
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.820]   - So I was working at this church up in Minnesota
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.180]   and we had just got married like not too long before that.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.740]   And I wasn't really making, when we first got married,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.100]   I was making $14,600 a year.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.820]   - And how old were you when you married?
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.780]   - 26, yeah.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.740]   - So not super early. - Just turned 26, yeah.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.140]   But you know, you're like ministry.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.820]   Like okay, it's not about the money,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.060]   but you know, I can buy toothpaste once a year
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.580]   and that's about it, you know?
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.580]   So yeah, so we took this full-time gig up in Minnesota
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.380]   at a church, went up there and I think it was like 50,000.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.660]   I was like 50 freaking thousand dollars.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.700]   Oh my gosh, what am I gonna do with all that money?
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.420]   I was like, I'm gonna be rich and wealthy
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.580]   in two years from now.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.860]   So we moved up there and we started doing a lot of dumb stuff
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.980]   where like, oh, we need a new car, you know?
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.580]   So we would finance the car,
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.260]   we'd do the down payment on the credit card
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.300]   and finance the rest.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.140]   And like, oh, well, let's buy a house.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.540]   - 'Cause you didn't have any savings.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.380]   - We didn't have anything, no, no, no.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.220]   We were like, yeah, it was our credit card.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.580]   - So it's kind of typical, we're married, let's build it up.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.420]   - Yeah, yeah, so--
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.940]   - That's impressive to finance a down payment
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.940]   for a car on your credit card.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.420]   - No, we did the down payment on the credit card,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.260]   we financed the rest of the car.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.020]   And then we wanted to buy a house.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.540]   So I met with a financial advisor in our church
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.300]   and I was just like, hey, how much of a house can we afford?
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.700]   I don't know, we're looking at like 100,000, 600,000,
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.940]   a million point two, like I don't really know
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.780]   what range I should be looking at here.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.820]   And so he come in with all our statements,
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.500]   we slide them across the table.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.740]   And that's the only question I wanted answered.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.580]   He's like looking through it,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.140]   he literally like runs his fingers through his hair,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.360]   goes, his eyes get big and he's like, wow.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.700]   You didn't say wow, but that's the expression on his face.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.740]   And he's like, okay, like before we talk about this,
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.140]   you guys first need to read this book.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.660]   And he slides total money makeover,
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.460]   a day for empty across the table.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.300]   He's like, read this book.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.980]   And then once you read it, come back and then we'll talk.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.260]   I was like, come on, dude, like that's not helpful.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.660]   Like just tell me the number.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.420]   So we leave and I'm like kind of a little upset,
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.900]   like that was a waste of time.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.580]   And so my wife reads the book and then she's like,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.980]   Tim, you need to read this.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.620]   I'm like, I don't, I just want to buy a house.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.700]   But I wanted to go back and get the numbers.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.580]   So I like, I read the book and at the end of the book,
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.220]   I was like, oh, okay, we got a different trajectory.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.740]   So we didn't have a lot of debt compared to some people.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.700]   We had student loans in the car and credit cards
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.520]   and things like that.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.500]   But I think all in all, it was like $22,000,
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.380]   a little over 22,000.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.220]   And cause I worked three jobs in college.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.220]   So I graduated from college without debt.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.020]   My parents, my in-laws pay for my wife's school stuff.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.200]   So I had some grad school debt, but yeah.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.100]   So we paid that off in 18 months
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.940]   and did our debt-free scream on YouTube,
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.740]   which went to like 20 some thousand views really quickly
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.560]   at that time.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.860]   It was a big deal.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.120]   And yeah, we've been debt-free now
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.340]   for like 11 or 12 years.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.180]   - All the way hardcore, like including the house?
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.260]   - Not including the house.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.080]   So we were like, when we bought the house,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.940]   our credit score was zero.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.380]   So like we told the guy, we had to do manual underwriting,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.460]   which was like not a big deal actually.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.860]   If it kind of fact, it kind of felt the way
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.100]   you should probably do it, Marcus.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.420]   But yeah, so we got manual underwriting.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.260]   It wasn't a big deal.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.080]   We got that done.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   And at the closing, the guy was like,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.780]   "Wow, you really do have zero.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.920]   "Like I've never seen a credit history
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.040]   "that has nothing on it.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.880]   "It's completely blank."
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.020]   Like usually when people say zero,
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   they mean it's like a hundred, like really bad.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.060]   It's like, but I've never seen one that's actually zero.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.180]   So we're like, yeah, we haven't done credit cards or debt.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.060]   We've just done all cash for the past 10 years.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.420]   So we did do the mortgage,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.860]   but we followed all Dave's stuff,
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.460]   which was quarter of your take-home pay
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.540]   and 15 year fixed.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.580]   And so we did all that.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.340]   And we are actually paying it off faster now.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.420]   - Great, great.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.420]   So along the way, your family expanded dramatically quickly.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.300]   When your twins were born,
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.060]   you had four children, two and under.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.300]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.580]   - So I've been there, right?
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.460]   My wife and I, we have four children, five and under.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.700]   And that's a pretty--
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.940]   - Yeah, I can do that in two years.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.780]   It's crazy. - Yeah.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.620]   - We had twins in there, which is kind of--
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.060]   - I'm filled with empathy for you
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.820]   and also extremely impressed
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.500]   because knowing how challenging four, five and under are,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.900]   I can imagine the challenge of even younger.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.180]   So how do you think your financial stability
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.140]   influenced your ability to handle
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.260]   the quick growth of your family and also your business?
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.180]   - I don't think we would have been able to handle the family
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.300]   without the business because,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.340]   and by that time when the twins came along,
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.300]   my wife was bedridden for the final three months
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.740]   of that pregnancy.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.140]   So I had, I think at that time,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.540]   there was like five, four or five people on my team.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.380]   And so for those final three months of the pregnancy
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.820]   plus the next three months after,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.820]   like I only worked like 10, 15 hours a week.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.420]   I didn't really, I wasn't,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.060]   like if I had a real job,
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.220]   like there was no way I would be able to do that.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.380]   Because I had other people in my business and my job
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.700]   who were kind of running things,
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.780]   it was a little bit easier for me
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.100]   to back off pretty significantly.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.660]   So I liked having that freedom to be able to be like,
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.420]   I'm gonna put my family first right now
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.660]   and the business can, you know,
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.060]   it would do better with me,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.860]   but the goal right now isn't to grow
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.500]   the biggest, baddest company in the world,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.740]   it's to provide for my family.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.180]   And sometimes that's financially,
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.820]   sometimes with your time.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.500]   And so that's why I was,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.420]   I had that freedom to do that,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.860]   which I'm really thankful for.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.580]   And we also hired a nanny,
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.620]   one of the girls from my old youth group,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.500]   moved down, they moved across the street from us.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.340]   And so she was over every weekday
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.660]   helping with cleaning the house and meals
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.620]   and watching the kids while I did some work
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.780]   and some stuff like that.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.460]   So having the financial means to do that,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.620]   to hire someone as well as not work as much
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.300]   is kind of what got us through that stage of life.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.100]   - Yeah, that's what I've experienced as well
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.340]   is that it seems like,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.780]   I mean, if I had to go to a 40 hour a week job
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.140]   plus commuting practically 50, 60 hours a week,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.060]   and if I weren't making enough money to hire help,
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.020]   I don't know how we'd do it.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.820]   You know, I understand why many families
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.140]   have one or two children and it's hard to handle.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.300]   It seems like a society,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.500]   it seems like our society once had more support available
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.140]   for mothers, but today it seems like
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.260]   it falls squarely on your shoulder as a husband
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.220]   to figure out how to provide that support
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.740]   'cause there's not much community support available.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.620]   - Yeah.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.060]   - So when you look at your business,
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.100]   one of the themes for your knowledge,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.220]   one of the themes that I've talked about a lot on the show
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.620]   is we try to balance the two horns
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.340]   of living a rich and meaningful life now
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.060]   and also working toward financial freedom.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.620]   And it seems like there's a proper tension
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.260]   between those themes that has to be held.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.860]   When you look at your business,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.860]   how do you think your family,
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.500]   has your family hurt you?
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.340]   In terms of your business success?
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.160]   - They're holding you back?
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   - Yeah.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.860]   - I don't know if they'd, I wouldn't say they hurt me
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.060]   because it's like I do it for them primarily.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.900]   - Right.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.240]   - You know, so I would say that,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.820]   like the only way I would say it hurts
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.900]   or is like a downside or something is like,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.060]   like when we travel to events and conferences and things
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.500]   like you, I try to take my kids as much as possible.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.300]   And sometimes they'll be like, oh no,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.460]   you can't bring your kid,
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.980]   either on that pass legal or we have, I'm like legal.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.060]   Like, what are they, what are they gonna do?
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.420]   - I'm gonna get my seven year old a whiskey.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.260]   - Yeah.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.080]   - Whiskey here at the bar.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.620]   - And then they're like, we need to get like insurance
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.340]   and like check with our insurance coverage.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.620]   And I'm like, what?
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.820]   Oh, just like, come as like, what?
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.980]   So, but, and there have been a few times where I'm like,
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.700]   that's, we share some different values.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.140]   This is not gonna work.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.800]   And I don't feel like that hurts though.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.980]   I feel like that's kind of just helping me like,
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.700]   hey, we're just not aligned on some of these things.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.340]   And so we're just not gonna work together.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.140]   It doesn't mean you're wrong or bad or anything.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.940]   It just means like you are, no.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.540]   It just means like, it's just not gonna be a good fit.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.740]   So if there's anything, it might've just, yeah,
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.860]   it saves me from taking, investing my energy
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.380]   in things that might not have been fruitful long-term
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.540]   because I think they're most fruitful
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.340]   when they're aligned with people who share your values
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.820]   and your vision and things.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   - In the data on income earners and wealth generators,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.780]   fathers tend to have the highest incomes
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.880]   and tend to accumulate the most wealth.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.100]   Now there's some debate.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.500]   Why is that, right?
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.880]   Does fatherhood somehow change something
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.940]   in terms of your earning income?
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.180]   Or is it just kind of a correlation
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.340]   that oftentimes the kind of man who's likely
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.180]   to earn a high income or accumulate wealth
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.980]   is also the kind of man who's likely to be a father?
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.980]   And I know of no proof or evidence for one way or the other.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.220]   Looking at your life, who you're making a high income,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.740]   you've accumulated wealth
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.660]   and are continuing to work on that path.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.260]   Looking at your life, do you think that fatherhood
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.060]   has affected positively your earnings
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.500]   and wealth accumulation?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.760]   - Yeah, 'cause if it was just me,
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.240]   I'd just be spending for myself
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.280]   and have a very narrow perspective on the world.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.020]   When we bought this house we just bought a few months ago,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.940]   before we even started looking at the market,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.960]   my wife and I sat down and we're like,
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.660]   "What's our vision for our family
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.980]   during these kid years, during the teen years,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.060]   during the grandparenting years?"
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.020]   You know, we fussed out.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.380]   We called it our Smoyer Estate Vision,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.340]   this little google doc,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.140]   and we just started writing everything down.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.640]   And so as we fussed out,
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.680]   what's our vision for our family going forward,
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   we started in this exercise,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.000]   started putting together what kind of space
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.440]   would serve this vision that well.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.600]   And so we started putting in the more practical terms
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.560]   of this is what we would need and how much
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.040]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   And so then we went and looked at the market
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.640]   to see where would we find this type of tool,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.160]   'cause we see our house and our property
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   and stuff is like a tool.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.360]   And money in general we view as a tool, it's not a goal.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.720]   It's a tool we use.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   So when we started, yeah, we started to go down that path,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.140]   there was only like one property
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.060]   that's ever been on the market
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.440]   that checked all the boxes
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.260]   and all of the greater Cincinnati area.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.980]   'Cause we looked on all the past two or three years as well
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.400]   to see if this is like a once in a,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.980]   like a unicorn type of property,
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.780]   or is this a like, oh, it comes on the market
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.740]   every two years or once a year.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.260]   This is just one, you know?
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.400]   And it was on the market at that time.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.100]   And it was in our price range
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.060]   if we took out the mortgage
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.260]   and still stayed within our Dave Ramsey limits.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.900]   And so we decided we were just gonna go ahead and do that.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.900]   And so we went ahead and did it and it worked great.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.840]   But even then it was like, we're buying this
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.500]   because it's gonna be a tool that we're gonna use
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.180]   for accomplishing this bigger vision for our family.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.180]   And which boils down to hospitality and influence for us.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.620]   Both of those as tools that we wanna use.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.600]   - But do you feel like you're more motivated
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.100]   to earn more, build a bigger business
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.900]   because of having seven little mouths depending on you?
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.420]   Or do you think that, well, if I were Tim
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.980]   and my wife and I had no kids,
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.460]   I'd still be just as motivated?
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.300]   - I don't think so.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.120]   No, you're probably right.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.440]   I think it was because I had a family
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.580]   and lost my job twice.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.940]   I'm like, this is, getting a job feels irresponsible.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.780]   - Right. - You know?
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.640]   Like I can't keep doing this.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.500]   So I, yeah, I think that was probably part of it.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.900]   Like I didn't go start the business
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.940]   because I had some sort of entrepreneurial dream.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.540]   I didn't even, I didn't know anything about business.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.020]   All my education's in theology, right?
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.980]   So it's like super not practical for day-to-day,
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.180]   like revenue type of generating stuff.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.020]   - Indeed.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.540]   - So yeah, so it was all self-taught.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.000]   And I was homeschooled growing up my whole life too.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.340]   So that probably helped a little bit.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.540]   And I'm like, I'm gonna go,
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.100]   I know how to teach myself stuff and figure it out.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.060]   So yeah.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.260]   - Tell me about homeschooling.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.300]   You just said that you gained from it
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.340]   and now you and your wife have decided to homeschool.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.180]   - Mostly me.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.300]   - That's parents as well. - Yeah.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.380]   She's on the fence.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.220]   She can go either way.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.820]   - Right, right. - So it's mostly my thing.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.220]   - Why do you homeschool?
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.900]   - Because I want them to,
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.300]   I want the primary identity that they form growing up
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.800]   to be in our family,
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.980]   not the identity that they're going to likely get
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.760]   just by the sheer like volume of time they're spending.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.860]   Like eight hours a day at school and then a few hours,
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.780]   you know, like you just break down the hourly rate.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.880]   I'm not saying that you lose your influence
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.100]   as a parent or anything,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.980]   but if they're in school, it's just more like,
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.980]   we wanted to, I should say I, my wife, like I said,
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.380]   she could go either way.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.580]   She's a certified elementary school teacher.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.700]   So she doesn't think, I don't think like school is bad either.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.760]   It's just kind of like, we have the opportunity
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.740]   to be able to invest into our kids' lives all day long
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.020]   and do this integrated thing
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.060]   rather than this separate bucket thing
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.020]   where you have like churches and spiritualities over here
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.980]   and then you have like educations here
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.900]   and then you have like family times over here
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.100]   and like, what if we just put all that together
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.360]   and we taught our kids like Bible at home
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.260]   and we spent time together by learning together
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.420]   and then they worked in our family business
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.340]   and like rather than trying to find time for everything
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.140]   and then there never feels like there's enough time
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.980]   at the end of the day,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.740]   what if we just did it all together at once?
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.900]   I know not everyone has the freedom to do that,
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.080]   but I wanted to orient our life around a rhythm
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.220]   that would get us there.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.060]   And so for me, it was less about like buckets
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.220]   and more about integration
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.020]   and having the influence on our kids
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.940]   that I want them to have,
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.820]   especially at that young impressionable age.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   - Building a family team is your core motto.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.260]   You guys introduce every one of your videos
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.100]   on your personal vlog with exactly that,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.920]   building a family team together.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.420]   How is that currently expressing itself with your children,
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.820]   especially as it relates to their schooling
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.900]   and your business and their work, et cetera?
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.100]   What are you doing right now?
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.180]   - Yeah, there's a couple different things
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.220]   on a couple different levels.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.700]   On a business level, my kids get paid as child actors.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.500]   So the business pays them,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.360]   it goes into an IRA for them,
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.740]   which they don't care about right now,
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.060]   but one day they will, right?
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.260]   So they get paid on one level
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.920]   and they are assets to our family
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.060]   because we get like lots of stuff,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.660]   you know, like toy companies will just send us
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.620]   hoping to be in a video,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.740]   but also just in terms of being on the channel
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.900]   and things like that.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.060]   They also have their own channel now
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.740]   that they shoot and edit and publish everything on their own.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.220]   So, I mean, my wife and I will prove it
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.180]   before they publish it,
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.400]   but they're editing an iMovie now and doing all that.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.220]   So that's like one aspect.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.400]   Another area though is as a team,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.600]   we all play different roles for a common goal,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.700]   common vision.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.120]   And so for our older kids now,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.060]   they are helping serve in ways that the younger kids don't.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.140]   Like, so for example, just this past week,
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   our youngest daughter, who's almost two,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.060]   has had this sinus infection going on for weeks
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.380]   and it's just nonstop nose, runny, coughing stuff.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.460]   And a friend of ours who's a nurse thought
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.940]   that maybe she was getting pneumonia.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.780]   So we're like, okay.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.100]   So my wife's like, drop everything.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.540]   I'm going, I gotta take her into the doctor
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.900]   and get this checked out.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.820]   And, but she's like,
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.180]   but that means I'm not gonna have dinner prep tonight.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.180]   So our 10 and eight year old cook dinner for our family,
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.620]   the whole thing from scratch.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.820]   They ground the beef, they chopped it up of everything.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.160]   They grated the cheese, put it all together
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   and made this really nice dinner for us.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.380]   And they didn't drain the beef as much
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.340]   as they probably should have,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.460]   but no one complained
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.180]   and they were super proud of themselves.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.980]   'Cause I think kids wanna feel like they're contributing.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.960]   They wanna feel like they're valuable.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.620]   And when they just sit on TV all day,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.740]   not saying we don't do that,
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.340]   but when they just feel like they're couch potatoes
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.100]   or they just get to do whatever they wanna do,
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.580]   they become these really selfish, self-centered people.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.620]   I think as all of us naturally would.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.220]   And so them feeling like they're part of this bigger team,
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.180]   it really helps shape their identity
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.860]   and what it means to be a team player,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.580]   but also what it means to serve.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.800]   And it's not always about me all the time.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.340]   And sometimes I give up something I wanted to do
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.760]   in order for the rest of the team.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.060]   So it's not perfect.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.820]   You know, they're kids and we're all human,
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.700]   but that's kind of the vision we cast for our kids
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.260]   is like, we're not one individual person
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.980]   and everyone needs their own world revolving around them.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.740]   We're like, right now it gotta revolve
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.900]   around the little one and we're all gonna pitch in
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.020]   and be a team for that.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.260]   So yeah, so whether it's meal planning
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.460]   or it's doing yard work outside
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.900]   or it's going to serve another family who's in need
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.740]   or something like that, we all kind of pitch in and do it.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.300]   - What are you guessing or hoping to see
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.540]   in the coming years as your children move into teenage years
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.740]   given the opportunities you have with entrepreneurship,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.060]   homeschooling, et cetera,
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.540]   what are some of your dreams for them
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.700]   or the things you think might happen
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.180]   in their life as they grow?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.820]   - The main thing I want them to happen
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.300]   is that they adopt some really important values
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.020]   and that they become people who kind of embody
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.620]   some of these things more so than like,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.140]   I want them to make sure they start a business.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.740]   I don't really care if they start a business or not.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.220]   Like maybe it's right for them, maybe it's not.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.380]   Like maybe they'll marry someone who's more successful
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.300]   or has different aspirations.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.380]   I don't know.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.460]   I'm not trying to dictate their life,
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.340]   but I do want them to grow up
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.540]   to have certain character qualities
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.140]   where they can think big picture and longer term.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.300]   They can plan for the future.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.620]   And what they're doing is all kind of ultimately
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.500]   revolving around Matthew 6, it says,
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.780]   "Seek first the kingdom of God,"
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.620]   all these things we gotta do.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.560]   So most of the time we use language like build the kingdom
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.340]   or invite the kingdom.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.820]   We're like, I don't even know what that thing means,
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.660]   to be honest.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.540]   But when it's like seek the kingdom of God,
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.020]   or we seek like where something important is happening
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.500]   and how do we join in that.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.740]   And I want them to be sensitive
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.580]   to being able to spot those opportunities
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.220]   and being like, this is what it means for me
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.060]   to be a team player in this context right now.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.780]   And so that could be in the home,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.420]   it could be outside the home, it could be in a career,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.140]   but I just kind of want them to grow up
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.060]   like with the core values that we put people first
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.740]   and that we are mission oriented, that we do it right.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.580]   These are our five things.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.380]   So people first, so that's like above everything else.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.940]   Like sometimes it makes, like for even in our business,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.100]   sometimes it doesn't make good revenue sense
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.100]   for us to do this, but it serves the person the best.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.780]   So we put people first.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.060]   We're mission oriented, that means like
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.860]   there's a bigger cause behind what we're trying to do here.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.820]   There's a family or there's a business then.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.220]   Like for us, it's not really just about growing views
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.940]   and subscribers for entrepreneurs.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.240]   It's more about like how do we spread a message
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.160]   that changes people's lives, right?
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.420]   And that we do it right.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.220]   And so it's like, it's not just something that you do,
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.300]   but you can do this right and then you own it,
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.860]   which is number four.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.060]   So you're responsible for the outcome and the results,
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.860]   not just like I technically did it, but you know, that one.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.420]   And then what's the last one?
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.780]   I'm throwing a blank here for some reason on the spot.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.940]   - People first, mission oriented, do it right.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.300]   - Oh, results driven, results driven.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.260]   Yeah, results driven.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.660]   So yeah, results driven is like,
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.860]   we're not just like think we're doing something nice
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.580]   for someone and we feel good about it,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.620]   but does it actually have like a tangible result?
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.440]   You know, so in the business,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.160]   like I don't wanna just help people
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.380]   grow their audience on YouTube.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.900]   I wanna be able to track,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.340]   is the stuff we're doing actually moving the needle?
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.800]   Is it actually making a difference?
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.540]   And so even when we're like serving people as a family
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.840]   with hospitality, one of our visions behind this place
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.740]   is that we can host family who are in transitions
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.580]   and need a place to stay.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.220]   So it's got like two extra units on it.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.020]   It's got three kitchens in this place.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.020]   So we can host families who need that and be hospitable,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.700]   but we wanna track the results.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.100]   So are we just enabling them to like not get a job
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.540]   or something, or are we actually helping them
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.260]   get the results if they want it?
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.460]   So it's not just about putting people first
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.200]   and then becoming, you know, whatever.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.700]   But you have the idea, yeah, so those five things.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.400]   - When you think about, I admire what you're doing.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.000]   I can see how, I'm not a big consumer of people's stories,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.180]   like the family vlog is not really my thing,
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.460]   but I've watched enough of your content
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:00.160]   to really come to appreciate how you are serving
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.540]   as a source of encouragement and inspiration for others,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   especially many who are lonely and who are in need
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.900]   to feel like nobody understands them.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.820]   And increasingly in today's world,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.340]   where we're personally isolated,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.720]   but technologically connected,
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.220]   I feel like what you're doing is valuable
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.220]   and I see why you're doing it
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.420]   and how it fits into your overall mission.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.480]   I've also personally really struggled with the impact
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.100]   and the challenge of, is this good for my children?
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.020]   Like to expose my children to the challenges
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:41.020]   that come with some measure of celebrity and notoriety,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.420]   whether it's on the grand scale,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.660]   children of famous actors, famous child actors,
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.940]   to the minor scale of preacher kid syndrome
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.540]   or missionary kid syndrome, things like that.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.040]   I've often wondered about that.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.660]   And my wife and I, a few years ago,
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.500]   we worked to take our children off the internet
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.380]   and decided, you know what, we're just not gonna,
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.380]   we're gonna keep them off there.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.080]   But I've really struggled with that
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.820]   'cause it doesn't seem like a very confident thing to do.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.740]   It seems more like a fear-driven thing to do
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.340]   instead of moving forward in confidence and in faith.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.260]   How do you think about that as a father
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.420]   in terms of the impact on your children?
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.340]   - I don't think there's a right or wrong answer with that.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.860]   I think it's just kinda based on your kids
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.380]   and your values and your vision for your family
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.360]   and what your kids need.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.620]   Like I don't think I can, yeah, I don't.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   - But in terms of, obviously you're aware
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.780]   and you're watching, what I'm asking is,
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.980]   as you're watching your children,
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.980]   are you seeing effects of the public lifestyle
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.380]   that you're living that you like,
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.680]   seeing effects that you don't like
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.080]   as compared to your friends who are more private?
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.640]   - I, yeah, so I think about that.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.120]   And when I, and I haven't really noticed anything
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.360]   that's making a huge difference either way.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.280]   Like I haven't noticed that,
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.360]   if, like one kid will get a bad attitude or something
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.160]   and I feel like, oh, that's because they're part
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.120]   of this public lifestyle or something.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.840]   And I also haven't noticed that they're really shy
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.480]   and introverted 'cause I feel like everyone knows
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.960]   who they are and they wanna be more private.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.480]   So I try to kind of keep my pulse on that
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.640]   and kind of keep an eye on it.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.000]   But I don't think that there's,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.280]   I haven't really noticed anything that makes it like,
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.160]   this is like bad or this is good or anything for my kids.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.720]   So I do notice, I think if there's anything,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.040]   I think my older ones are probably feel
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.000]   a bit more confident in being around people.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.540]   And I don't know if it's because they're like,
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.320]   everyone loves me, who doesn't love me?
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.160]   You know, everyone I meet.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.760]   - I'm constantly getting.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.680]   - Anyone who meets me is like excited to meet me.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.520]   I must be awesome.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.240]   I don't, that's what I'm trying to be careful about.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.720]   But I know I haven't seen that happen.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.200]   And I think a lot of it is how my wife and I model that
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.640]   for them as well.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.320]   But then there's another kid in my family
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.560]   who's like really, really shy
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.420]   and like would probably prefer to just be by themselves.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.480]   So yeah, I guess I don't really have a strong opinion
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.600]   about that either way.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.000]   It's something that we're conscious and aware of,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.680]   but I don't have any like, this is how we do it
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   and this is the right or wrong way.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.160]   I think it's like an always evolving,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.760]   changing thing as the kids grow.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.120]   - When you, you guys are very connected
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   with digital technology, for obvious reasons, right?
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.680]   That's how you're interacting with the world.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.540]   You're constantly connected and your children are engaged
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.520]   in producing that technology.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.200]   But you obviously have a vision in terms of your homeschooling
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.160]   and your education, et cetera.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.200]   When you think about the impact of that technology
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.920]   on your children, the connectivity, et cetera,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.560]   do you think it's a net positive?
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.320]   Do you think it's a net negative?
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.160]   How do you engage with it as a father?
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.200]   - We monitor it and we limit it.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.800]   So it's like, so one of the sayings in our house
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.280]   is good work brings good reward.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.320]   So that's our, one of our, I don't know,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.880]   yeah, sayings, mottos, creeds, whatever.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   And so they know that like when they get like the screen time
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.880]   to tell, it's usually because it's a result of good work.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.640]   It's like a reward that they've earned.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.040]   So yeah, so it gets kind of limited.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.400]   Like we'll say, no, you can't watch TV.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.800]   You gotta go outside and play right now.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   So it's, but we don't shut them off from that either.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.440]   If they had their way, they would just sit there
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.280]   and watch it all day long, every day,
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.560]   which is why there's parents involved.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.960]   So it doesn't happen.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.840]   - Do you limit the video creation at all
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.040]   or the work of video creation?
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.440]   - Not really, they kind of limit that themselves.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.000]   They'll be like, if there's something
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.880]   that they really wanna shoot, they'll shoot it.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.240]   But they're not trying to like put themselves out there
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.080]   all day, every day.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.040]   It's kind of like, oh, I'm really excited about this.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.800]   And this fits with what we're trying to do on our channel.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.400]   Like, can I make a video about this dad?
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.080]   And then I'll say, well, tell me the idea.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.440]   What's the story you're gonna tell?
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.000]   And we walk through a character who wants something,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.440]   overcomes conflict to get it, right?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.600]   And we just kind of like, what is, what's going on here?
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.720]   And then I'll say, okay, good.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.360]   So after they've kind of thought through it,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.480]   then I'll let them shoot it and edit it.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.960]   But yeah, that's, I would say they,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   they go through spurts with that.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.880]   They'll make maybe like four videos in a day
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.640]   and then they won't touch it again for like a month.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.240]   So yeah, that's not a huge source issue for us.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.800]   - Are you aware of, in the personal finance space,
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.560]   the financial independence, early retirement movement,
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.400]   or any of the people--
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.440]   - I've done some consultations with people in that niche.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.480]   Yeah, who are like, live on,
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.160]   I mean, Dave's very amused, words,
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.420]   beans and rice and just save everything
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.720]   so they can retire at age 35.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.440]   Do you, do you think about how your children
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.680]   will impact your retirement, those kinds of things?
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   - So I'm only 30, only 30, I guess I'm midlife, 39.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.480]   And I haven't really thought, I mean,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.600]   we're putting money in the way in the Vanguard
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.760]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.320]   But the company has a 401k.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.120]   But I read a book called "Thou Shalt Prosper"
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.440]   by Daniel Lapin, have you read that book?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.720]   - Yes. - Okay, so he,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.840]   in there, like one of the analogies he uses for retirement,
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.560]   he's like, they say the word,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.840]   Jews believe that the word doesn't exist in Hebrew,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.440]   that it's a man-made concept, and it's not from God.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.200]   And so there is no equivalent word in Hebrew for retirement.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.100]   And so they believe that this is not an actual concept
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.940]   that should exist.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.520]   And so he uses in the book, the analogy
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.040]   of when you swing a golf club, you don't,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.400]   like if retirement is the goal, hitting the ball is the goal,
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.360]   you like slow down before hitting the ball,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.640]   and then you don't really drive the ball that far.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   But if there's no concept of retirement,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.920]   then you hit the, you follow through in the ball,
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.880]   and you're constantly swinging into that one big push
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.000]   until you die, and you'll get a lot further.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.760]   And so that kind of hit a chord with me.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.640]   I'm not like, we are saving for retirement,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.000]   I'm not anti like, I think for me,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.280]   it's less about retiring and more about shift,
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.920]   being able to shift my focus,
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.320]   on not having to generate income right now,
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.800]   instead I can just go be there for my grandkids
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.120]   and let my kids and their spouses go have date nights
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.600]   and be able to serve in other capacities
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.880]   than I can currently.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.040]   So I don't think that answers your question.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.520]   I think it more in terms of a season of life
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.480]   rather than like ceasing of work
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.320]   and doing what I finally wanna do.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.240]   - Final question.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:26.120]   If you were to be in a room speaking with people
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.600]   who are young parents and who are struggling
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.360]   to manage the challenges of children
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.160]   and the challenges of jobs or businesses
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.040]   and feel like they're not doing anything well,
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.560]   what words of encouragement or advice would you share?
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.160]   - It gets worse if you have more kids.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.040]   No, that's not even true.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.460]   No, it's the encouragement I would say,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.280]   like in terms of a practical, like what to do,
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.840]   'cause we've, I mean, you've been there,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.240]   everyone's been there, that's not a unique thing.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.120]   Is, sorry if that hurts anybody,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.440]   but it's like the thing that's helped us the most
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.600]   is thinking more about, rather than prioritizing
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.200]   and balance, is to think more in terms
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.680]   of integrating and priorities.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.400]   So it's like, what do we say is our family,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.560]   this is the most important thing for our family,
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.160]   let's put a list of priorities,
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.320]   and then we draw a red line,
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.200]   and whatever falls below the red line,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.400]   it might be great things, it just doesn't get done, right?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   So it's like, we wanna make sure
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.160]   we put the most important things first
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.640]   and that those stay a priority.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.920]   So if that means, like our kids don't do sports
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.880]   because it would be impossible for us
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.580]   to drive kids around to different sports
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.880]   and still have time to get together as a family.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.720]   Time to go as a family for us is more important
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.680]   than our kids playing sports,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.440]   and so we just don't do sports.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.260]   Now maybe, as they get older,
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.840]   we could maybe do something like tennis,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.320]   where we could all four of us be on a court at a time,
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.080]   you know, and kind of double up with that,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.400]   integrate a little bit better, but there's, yeah.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.680]   So prioritizing is how we think about it
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.560]   rather than balance, and then it's better systems for us.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.120]   So like, as a business grows,
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.560]   things break as the business grows,
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.640]   and same thing is true as your family.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.600]   As your family grows and the kids get older
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.760]   and things change, the difficulties there
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.700]   aren't because like, oh, we can't sustain
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.200]   more than four kids, it's like saying,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.040]   oh, we can't have more than four employees.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.200]   It's like, no, you can grow to thousands of employees,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.480]   you just need better systems to manage that.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.720]   And the same is true for a family.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.040]   If like the discipline is breaking down,
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.800]   but you need a better discipline system.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.560]   It's not like you can't take a third child
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.040]   because you're having too much struggle
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   with the two you currently have.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.000]   It's like, you know, you just need
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.200]   a better discipline system.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.560]   And so we think about it like, yeah, that way.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.700]   Like, what's a better system?
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.640]   This is not working with these four kids
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.280]   or with these seven kids or whatever.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.800]   What do we need to do different?
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.840]   And so we grow the family structure
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.480]   the same way we grow a business structure.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.980]   - You may disagree, but my opinion is
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.740]   I think that there is a direct influence
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.580]   on your ability to run an effective business.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.620]   I can tell your business is effective.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.360]   And it's extremely unusual for somebody
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.260]   who never had entrepreneurial ambition
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.800]   to be able to run an effective systematized business.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.780]   And I think you feel free to say
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.940]   if you think I'm right or wrong.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.300]   But I think that it is some of the lessons
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.780]   that you learned in learning how to order your family
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.820]   that apply over to the business.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.040]   - I think it went the other way around for me, actually.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.260]   It was like, when we started the business,
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.620]   we had a few kids.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.980]   And as I was learning about growing the business,
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.420]   things would break down.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.860]   I remember the first time I made my first hire
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.060]   was because things were breaking down
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.860]   'cause I couldn't do it all anymore.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.700]   And so I made one hire,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.900]   and then I learned a ton of lessons about communication.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.900]   And then I'm like, oh, this applies to my family.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   And then as I was learning more about
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.560]   having a vision for your business
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.100]   and a mission behind it,
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.980]   oh, my family needs a business.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.380]   And even branding, what are the things
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.480]   that make it easy for a customer
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.180]   to fall in love with a brand
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.020]   are the same things that I can do with my family.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.220]   Well, what's gonna capture my kids' hearts for our family?
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.740]   And the marketing world's doing it all day long
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.220]   to them, being very successful at it.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.140]   But as a dad, I can use those same tools
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.340]   that I'm using to grow the influence
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.720]   that our business has.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.420]   I can do that as a family,
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.820]   and capture my kids' hearts in terms of our creed
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.580]   and our mission and our vision and our core values
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:18.420]   and all that stuff, like icons
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.420]   and the rituals we do together as families
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.320]   and the things we say we're not,
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.180]   like all these primal branding type of elements
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.100]   that we have just taken and done for our family
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.060]   and captures our kids' hearts.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.820]   So I think it's like running the business
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.060]   has actually taught me how to lead my family better
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.980]   'cause when it's a pain point in the business,
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.540]   it's like, oh, I need to fix this.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.860]   But if it's a pain point in the family,
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.820]   the normal response is like,
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.140]   we just can't have more kids,
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.240]   or we just need to go to therapy
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.500]   because there's something wrong with you.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.300]   It's like, oh, well, maybe that's true.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.140]   There is always something wrong with us,
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.340]   but maybe there's a better system that we could figure out.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.140]   I think it was the other way for me.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.740]   - Yeah, fair enough.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.100]   I'm happy for it to go both ways.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.980]   I think for some people, for me,
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.540]   I think it's often gone the other way
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.860]   in simply that you have to learn lessons.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.700]   And I'm convinced that one of the benefits
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.300]   of being a father is you have,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.960]   whether you work for someone else,
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.580]   whether you have no job freedom whatsoever,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.780]   at least in your home, you have your own,
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.100]   you can be the king of your castle.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   And that means that you bear the responsibility
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.620]   and you recognize that if I have this authority
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.940]   and this responsibility simultaneously,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.420]   then I have to wield it well because I'm responsible.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   If I don't wield it well, I get disastrous results.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.740]   If I wield it well, I get really good results.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.700]   And I think it can have an influence both ways.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.620]   - Yeah, sure. - So I'll buy it.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.460]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.100]   - I think you're one of the most effective,
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.940]   simplest, clearest teachers on YouTube.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.380]   Take a moment and share with my audience
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.340]   about some of the work that you do,
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.820]   where they may be interested to go to learn more,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.060]   and if they wanna become one of your students,
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.900]   how they can do that.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.860]   - Yeah, you just go to, we have a podcast every,
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.380]   I have a podcast, I just said, every Tuesday.
