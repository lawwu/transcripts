[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.800]   at the,,, 12 12 buy
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:53.600]   provin. You are an entrepreneur. You are at least a modest personal finance aficionado. Wow. That's a new word for me. And you and your wife have seven young children. Your eldest is now just turned 10. Okay. So you have seven children, 10 and under. So your life is an absolute joy and an absolute craziness. I'm sure. I started with joy. I started with joy. But I wanted to have you on to talk about entrepreneurship and joy.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.360]   something
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.640]   during. I have,,,,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.000]   a question for you. How did your business and entrepreneurship journey begin?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.040]   Yeah, I was a youth and family worker at a church for like 12 years and that ended very poorly.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.360]   We had a lot of bad things kind of go on the church and it ended up with 10 of us being fired
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.000]   on staff. It was a sizable church and so I was number nine out of the 10 and losing your job
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and losing your job when you need to like make some money, you know, it's a quick, you know,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and losing your job when you need to like make some money, you know, it's a quick, you know,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and losing your job when you need to like make some money, you know, it's a quick, you know,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and losing your job when you need to like make some money, you know, it's a quick, you know,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:13.780]   a quick, you know, it's a quick, you know, it's a quick, you know, it's a quick, you know, you gotta figure something out real fast.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.480]   And you would have had one baby at the time?
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.860]   We had two at the time. We had two at the time.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.080]   Yeah, so I guess it was maybe like 2011 or I don't know exactly.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.020]   There's nothing like getting fired and losing your job when you have two little babies at home.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.520]   Yeah, and they gave me some severance but it expired on Christmas day.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.880]   And you're like, oh, Merry Christmas everybody.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.580]   Right, right.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.380]   So, yeah, so that, so I started, I spent a few years just kind of living off the blog
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.520]   and turned that into an income really quick because I didn't have a choice and, you know,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.640]   all the light of fire under your butt to get that going. So I did that and then I'm still looking forward to it.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.060]   And you would have had one baby at the time?
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.120]   Yeah, so I guess it was maybe like 2011 or 2011 or I don't know exactly.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:03:06.520]  , but I didn't have a choice and, you know, all the light of fire under your butt to get that going.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.920]   So I did that and then I was still looking for other youth ministry gigs and stuff, but there wasn't anything that was like,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   either I was really just trigger shy or whatever, gun shy or something, I don't know, but eventually I took a job up in Cincinnati doing YouTube strategy for a company.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.100]   I've already been like our YouTube channel is already reaching like a million people a month.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.200]   I've already been like a million people a month.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.300]   Because you and your wife had started kind of an informal vlog.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   Yeah, I started off when I was in grad school.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.400]   I just wanted to introduce her to my family.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.000]  , I just wanted to introduce her to my family.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.820]   I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.840]   I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.280]   And so we put together little videos and that was like 2006 before blogging was a thing.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   And so we put together little videos and that was like 2006 before blogging was a thing.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   And so we put together little videos and that was like 2006 before blogging was a thing.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.360]   Right.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.840]   Right.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.880]   And so we do those and so the channel is growing, we're reaching about a million people a month and so I do a YouTube strategy for this company and had a lot of fun with that.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   And so we do those and so the channel is growing, we're reaching about a million people a month and so I do a YouTube strategy for this company and had a lot of fun with that.

No, we did the down payment on the credit card. We financed the rest of the car and then we, uh, wanted to buy a house. So I met with a financial advisor and our church and I was just like, Hey, how much of a house can we, for, I don't know. Or man was looking at like a hundred thousand, 600,000, a million point two.

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.920]   expanded dramatically quickly.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   You said you had when you're when your twins were born, you had four children, two and under.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.720]   That's right. Yeah.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.420]   So I've been there, right?

[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.880]   And that's a pretty trying.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.820]   Yeah, we got in two years.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.720]   It's crazy. Yeah.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.520]   We had twins in there, which is kind of. . .
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:12.320]   I'm filled with empathy for you and also extremely impressed because knowing how challenging four or five and under are, I can imagine the challenge of even younger.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.160]   So how
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   How do you think the challenge of even younger?
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   So how do you think the challenge of even younger?

[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:42.140]   I don't think we would have been able to handle the family without the business because and by that time when the twins came along, my wife was bedridden for the final three months of that pregnancy.

Yeah. So when you look at your business, do you, one of the themes for your knowledge, one of the themes that I've talked about a lot on the show is we try to balance the two, two horns of living together and living together and living together and living together.

[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:52.140]  , but it serves the person the best. So we put people first. Mission oriented, that means like there's, there's a bigger cause behind what we're trying to do here. It is a family or the business. And like for us, it's not really just about growing views and subscribers for entrepreneurs. It's more about like how do we spread a message that changes people's lives. Right? And that we do it right. And so it's like, it's not just something that you do, but you do this right.
