[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.660]   I got a thumbs up.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.360]   Dirk's like the one other person besides me actually on camera.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.060]   Yeah, I would, but I'm quite sick.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.380]   So no worries.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.120]   No worries.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.060]   Thank you for still being willing to kick us off then.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.020]   Appreciate it.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.180]   Yeah, no worries.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.500]   Okay.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.700]   I finally found it.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.740]   Sorry for the delay.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.140]   Awesome.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.800]   All right.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.780]   Well, I'll hand off.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.660]   Would you, if you'd like,
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.900]   I can keep an eye on the chat
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200]   and just flag things as they're there
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.880]   so you don't have to pay attention to it.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.540]   And then, yep.
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.560]   So welcome everyone.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   I'm going to hand over to Olivier.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.800]   He kicked off probably the most epic thread
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.840]   we've had in the AI in Action channel
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.520]   talking about quad and subagents.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.040]   So he's going to present about his approach and workflow.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.840]   It sounds like he's going to be sick
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.480]   and he's in EU time zone.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.280]   So he'll kick us off for the first, you know, 20, 30 minutes
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.920]   and then we can continue the conversation.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.160]   And with that, I will go off camera,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.120]   hand it over to you, Olivier.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   Great.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.820]   Okay.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.260]   So let's give you some background,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.280]   everyone who's watching.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.520]   Markov is an AI engineering studio.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660]   we're based in Antwerp and long story short,
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.680]   we're focused on the automation of accounting systems.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.880]   So end-to-end accounting and we're also in MedTech
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.120]   now bringing both systems to production
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.900]   on like a pan-European scale.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.920]   for me with cloud code
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.180]   and the really big unlock
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.840]   came around
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.800]   the four model series release
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.480]   and then these subagents
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.140]   just make things a lot more reliable.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.660]   I think it's important,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.560]   even though I won't go into this
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   in high detail today,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.940]   that everyone is aware of
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.560]   how we get to the point
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.000]   within Markov
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840]   where we start using cloud code, right?
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.260]   So
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.960]   for us,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.380]   the big learnings have been
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.720]   that as the models
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.620]   have been getting better
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.500]   at coding.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.680]   So actually,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.060]   you know,
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.420]   for everyone who's been
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.560]   working with these models
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.360]   for a long time,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.480]   I'm sure you'll know
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.220]   like a few years,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.060]   maybe even
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.400]   double digit months ago,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.080]   they were still making
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.020]   a lot of syntax errors.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.200]   That's not really the case anymore.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680]   And the models have gotten pretty good.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.000]   So now we've come to the point
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.080]   at least for us internally
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.040]   where we will often,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.440]   and this is like,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.820]   you know,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.420]   in the scope of like internal tools
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.160]   or like prototypes for customers
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.040]   because we also do a bit
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.460]   of consulting on the side.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.480]   You know,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.780]   our flagship products
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.840]   are medtech and accounting.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.700]   So fintech,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.440]   but we also do a bit
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.380]   of consulting on the side
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.940]   because we haven't raised
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.500]   any capital
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.660]   and it's a nice way
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.760]   to generate some cash flow.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.980]   So what we have
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.680]   is basically
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.820]   on my screen,
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.940]   you'll see we have,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.520]   so this is kind of our directory
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.800]   and all of our prompts
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.080]   that we share within our team
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.740]   are stored in here.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.980]   The main reason
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.620]   that I'm sharing all of this,
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.300]   even though,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.640]   you know,
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.500]   I think a lot of people
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.320]   would consider this
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.840]   to be quite proprietary data
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.280]   is because in a few months,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.420]   it's all going to be relevant anyway
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.500]   because I'm pretty sure
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.180]   that at least
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.960]   that's been my experience
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.380]   so far,
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.700]   all this kind of hardness
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.800]   thing and scaffolding
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.360]   as the models get better,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.900]   it just gets washed away.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.540]   So maybe I'll be able
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.340]   to help some people
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.940]   in the coming months
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.040]   with this.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.260]   So as you can see,
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.500]   we have these like
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.520]   architecting prompts.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.980]   We can see we have
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.540]   these like subsections
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.180]   of prototypes.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.200]   We have a Jinja,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.100]   FastAPI,
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.120]   local,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   Azure,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.700]   you know,
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.860]   so this is like for,
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.820]   this is a prompt
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.740]   that we use
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.820]   to generate,
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.940]   to create prototype plans
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.840]   for like really,
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.140]   really quick prototypes
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.380]   that will just like
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.320]   run our machine.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.940]   like we don't even
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940]   deploy to Azure.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.020]   It's like for super quick
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.760]   customer demos
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.520]   and this prompt
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.780]   is basically like
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.120]   it's catered fully
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   to our stack.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.100]   It has like a lot
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.880]   of methodologies
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.640]   that we use
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.000]   on how we want
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.560]   our plans
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.240]   to be constructed.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.560]   So we always use
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.500]   OpenAI agents,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.860]   SDK,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.060]   we use Lytlm
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.940]   with open routers.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.560]   So all our code
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.880]   is model agnostic
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.040]   or at least the prototypes.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.860]   The big downside
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.520]   with this,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.320]   I'm not sure
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.780]   if there's many
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.720]   other Europeans here
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.100]   is that
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.540]   it's more difficult
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.380]   to be GDPR compliant
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.060]   when you use
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.780]   LightLM
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.500]   and open routers.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.200]   So in production,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.980]   it's usually
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.220]   OpenAI agents,
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.620]   SDK,
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.980]   and then some
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.680]   European endpoint.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   But for prototyping,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.960]   it doesn't matter as much.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.080]   And this is really nice
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.620]   because this way
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.280]   you can just easily
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.960]   swap models in and out
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.320]   and if it is already
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.140]   included in your
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.000]   planning stage,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.440]   then it just makes
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.220]   life a lot easier.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.440]   Then we usually
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.640]   go with hexagonal
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.900]   LightStructures
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.800]   or hexagonal
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.580]   software architecture.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.780]   We define a bunch
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.960]   of variables
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.040]   that are important
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.080]   to us specifically
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.760]   for these local
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.260]   prototypes.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.060]   We usually use
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.940]   SQLite
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.980]   and FastAPI.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.700]   And then if we
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.840]   wanted to go really fast,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.320]   we also have
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.020]   like Streamlit.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.240]   So some Streamlit
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.920]   prototypes
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.200]   which don't even
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.300]   have like FastAPI.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.140]   We also have one
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.640]   where we use
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.900]   Streamlit as a UI
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.620]   with a FastAPI
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.500]   and then two containers
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.460]   which we can then
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.580]   deploy to Azure
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.300]   if we want to.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.020]   So that's kind of
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.160]   the essence of it, right?
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.500]   And you'll see
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.320]   like there's nothing
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.280]   in here
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.060]   that really takes us
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.600]   to production.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.540]   That's because,
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.300]   well,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.180]   you don't,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.680]   you don't really
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.920]   architect software
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.580]   that often
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.020]   to take it to production,
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.500]   right?
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.420]   So that's usually
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.440]   like custom work
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.560]   that we only have to do
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.140]   when we like
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.800]   want to start
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.320]   a new flagship
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.360]   product or something.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.160]   That's not really
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.780]   part of this.
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.200]   But if it were,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.800]   then it would be
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   something like FastAPI
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.900]   with Pydantic
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.640]   and then like
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.500]   if there's a frontend,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.280]   frontend,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   it would be something
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.560]   TypeScript
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.380]   React-based, right?
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.360]   I think that's
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.900]   what most people
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.700]   are doing these days.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.400]   So let's,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.300]   oh,
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.760]   and then I also
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.660]   have this agent
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.180]   blueprint
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.560]   prompt
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.820]   which will basically
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.460]   generate a plan
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.180]   of our agents
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.720]   that we want
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.060]   to create
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.480]   for a certain project.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.160]   And we also have
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.540]   a test,
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.060]   oh yeah,
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.720]   we also have
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.580]   the test-driven
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.440]   development prompt.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.020]   So to recap
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   how it usually works
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.200]   is we have
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.760]   some idea
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.580]   of some prototype
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.340]   or some application
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.040]   that we want to make.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.900]   Then we will pick
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.540]   the stack that we want.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.140]   So FastAPI Ginger
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.980]   or Streamlet
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.480]   or something else.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.960]   And then at the bottom
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.640]   of these prompts
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.460]   you can always see,
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.580]   sorry,
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.740]   you can always see
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.660]   like paste your idea
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.340]   below this line.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.520]   So this is nice
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.400]   because that means
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.760]   that whatever provider,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.560]   whatever model
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.620]   is best at
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.600]   architecting,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.320]   you know,
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.560]   for like a week
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.200]   it was Gemini
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.880]   2.5 DeepThing
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.500]   and before that
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.460]   it was O3 Pro
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.000]   and now it's,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.280]   you know,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.600]   it's
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.800]   GP5 Pro again.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.880]   So you just swap
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   between the models
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.440]   and usually
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.220]   how I go about
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.240]   is if I want to
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.900]   create some
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.780]   like internal tool
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.820]   and
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.520]   give some context
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.900]   our internal tools
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.400]   like we build them
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.120]   once
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.700]   and then we actually
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.500]   keep building on them.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.880]   so we want
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.200]   to make sure
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.960]   that the first time
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.500]   we make them
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.440]   is like already
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.920]   maintainable,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.260]   scalable code.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.560]   So no spaghetti code
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.220]   and how it usually works
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.200]   is we'll,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   you know,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.340]   depending on what
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.820]   I want to do,
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.740]   I will pick a prompt
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.020]   and then I will just
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.940]   paste this prompt in
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.380]   and then I will
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.480]   ideate with
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.340]   which I should put you.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.080]   So I will just
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.540]   use voice messages,
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.520]   transcribe,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.420]   and basically
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.900]   spend like half an hour
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.460]   to an hour
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.540]   just going through
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.120]   the motions
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.320]   of what does this
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.080]   actually look like?
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.740]   what is the user
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.840]   journey that I want?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.380]   So the user stories
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.700]   and what are the
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.500]   functional requirements?
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.560]   And then
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.140]   when I've gone
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.680]   through that,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.240]   then I'll take
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.020]   the output of that
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.860]   and I'll start
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.400]   a new session
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.100]   and I basically
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.780]   paste it underneath
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.460]   here and then
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.120]   you get a very
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.000]   nice verbose plan.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.760]   then when you have
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.240]   that plan
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.920]   you can put that
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.800]   plan underneath
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.520]   this prompt
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.900]   which will basically
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.460]   create a whole
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.920]   test set
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.840]   for your code
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.740]   because,
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.800]   and we'll get to that
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.220]   in a bit,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.560]   so within cloud code
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.420]   the only way
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.320]   you can really get it
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.940]   to work reliably
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.760]   from my experience
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   at least,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.080]   it's obviously
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.920]   limited,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.640]   is to really double down
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.760]   on test-driven development
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.000]   but these models
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.900]   are quite prone
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.700]   to reward hacking
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.140]   so you really
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.760]   want to make sure
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.420]   that the test-driven
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:25.940]   development
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.720]   for that in itself
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.280]   you also have
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.300]   like a standalone plan.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.660]   so you'll see
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.960]   we kind of go through
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.040]   the motions
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.580]   of doing,
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:35.880]   you know,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.200]   you want to do unit tests,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.120]   end-to-end tests,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.940]   smoke tests,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.160]   live API keys,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.920]   kind of everything.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.000]   Then when this is done,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   so you'll have two plans,
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.840]   right,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.880]   you'll have your test-driven
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.300]   development plan,
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.940]   so you have your test-plan-md
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.160]   and then you have
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.000]   your plan-md,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.400]   right,
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.480]   and these two files
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.880]   depending on
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.680]   the complexity
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.260]   of the application
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.940]   that you're making,
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.040]   either you can
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.960]   separate them
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.260]   and have like
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.920]   two markdown files
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.460]   you're working with
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.680]   or you just append
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.540]   one after the other
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.100]   and you have your plan-md
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.800]   to get started.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.620]   So that's kind of
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.100]   the whole journey
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.000]   before you get to
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.600]   actually using cloud code
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   and then
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.220]   this is the fun part.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.260]   Real quick question
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.160]   came in in the chat
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.960]   before we move on
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.580]   from this section
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.280]   which is around
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   for all of these
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.000]   sort of high-level
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.820]   guidance prompts,
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.940]   are these also generated
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.600]   by a model?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.340]   Do you have like
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.100]   a base prompt
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.540]   that you use
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.440]   to generate them
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.840]   or like
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.680]   how are you managing
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   those kind of prompts
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.220]   over time?
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.420]   Yeah,
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.800]   that's a good question.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.040]   I mean,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.720]   I've been working
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.320]   with these models
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   for a very long time
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.260]   so it's kind of
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.020]   intuitive to me
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.240]   but we do have,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.000]   so we have prompts
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.540]   for everything,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:47.940]   right,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.460]   and let's see.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.580]   so depending on the subject matter
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.300]   I will usually,
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.200]   like if it's something
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.240]   I don't know anything about,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.980]   like for example,
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.500]   we have this MedTech project,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.620]   like flagship product,
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:01.900]   right,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.400]   and obviously I'm not a doctor
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.360]   so I want to do a lot
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.900]   of deep research.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.800]   So we have these prompts
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.720]   where you like,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.360]   you basically,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.340]   same principle,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.320]   to put your query underneath
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.140]   and it will generate
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.480]   a highly verbose,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.580]   like super detailed
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.340]   deep research query
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.940]   for you,
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.100]   which you can then again
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.840]   put into
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.460]   JetGPT
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.420]   or whatever model
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.020]   you want to use
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.000]   for deep research.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.760]   and then we also have
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.200]   like user query
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:30.840]   to prompt,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.140]   same principle,
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.440]   it's a prompt
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.020]   that helps you
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.700]   create prompts,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:35.940]   right,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.540]   so you basically,
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.840]   you put your thoughts
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   underneath
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   and from my experience,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.380]   I always,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.780]   always,
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.860]   always just to
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.620]   speech to text,
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.180]   right,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.300]   because bandwidth
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.040]   that you have
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.140]   when you're typing,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.760]   you'll always,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.440]   you're always going
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.140]   to take shortcuts
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.780]   whereas
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.080]   when you can just
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.040]   talk to these models,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.580]   you will just
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.620]   use a lot more
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.100]   like,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.860]   you know,
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.900]   of your own tokens,
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.900]   your bandwidth
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.800]   is much larger
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.920]   and you'll,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.040]   like from my experience
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.920]   at least,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.240]   obviously anecdotally,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.920]   a lot of the times
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.880]   when you're like talking
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.120]   to these models
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.860]   or like recording
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.760]   this first message,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.060]   halfway through
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.920]   you're going to realize
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.000]   that something
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.920]   you said actually
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.660]   doesn't make sense
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.600]   and then you just cancel
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.320]   and you go again.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.200]   So you're kind of,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.960]   you're kind of iterating
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.680]   with yourself
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.280]   and then when you're happy.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.720]   talking makes you think
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.360]   in a different way
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.100]   than writing does.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.860]   And then you put
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.120]   your idea underneath
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.220]   and then you get a prompt,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.660]   right?
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.160]   And then
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.320]   for actually improving
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.960]   your prompts,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.160]   that's kind of
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.240]   this nice thing
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.940]   with these models.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.380]   So usually
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.340]   what I do
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.240]   is I just find
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.400]   like all the papers
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.840]   and like best practices
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.580]   that the labs release.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.980]   So OpenAI,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.520]   Entropic,
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.140]   I always have this,
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.720]   they're like best practices
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.440]   for prompting your models.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.040]   So I will scrape that
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.840]   and then based on
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.480]   the documents
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.200]   that I've scraped,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.060]   I will basically
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.060]   improve
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.260]   my prompt improver,
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:07.700]   right?
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.520]   And then
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.980]   you use that
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.800]   scrape documentation,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.840]   you use the most
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.600]   intelligent model
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.560]   that's available to you
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.620]   and you just like
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.500]   iterate on
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.140]   your prompt improver.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.460]   So it's kind of funny
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.280]   because it scales
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:19.700]   pretty well
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.640]   with model intelligence.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.020]   And we also have
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.640]   these like best practices,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.080]   right?
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.900]   So we have like this
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.040]   best practices
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.300]   prompting playbook.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.880]   You know,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.480]   you see you have
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.540]   some XML stuff here
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.200]   that's, you know,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.320]   specifically for
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.200]   the cloud model series
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.020]   and then we have
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.260]   some best practices
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.700]   for
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.540]   the GPT-5 models.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.680]   But yeah,
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.600]   that's a long story short,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.340]   that's kind of
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.060]   how we go about it.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.580]   so you just
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.700]   scrape what's out there
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.860]   and then you put
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.160]   the,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.060]   take that context
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.580]   and you ask
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.820]   the smartest model
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.140]   that's available to you
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.120]   to, you know,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.980]   make it make sense
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.880]   and help you
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.960]   with prompt engineering.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.720]   But it's always,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.500]   it's very important
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.000]   that you,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.140]   like this whole phase
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.780]   of planning
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.940]   and prompt engineering,
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.500]   it's not a hands-off thing.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.920]   You actually have to monitor it
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.440]   and put in your own time,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.180]   your own thoughts,
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.820]   else it's not going to work.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.200]   OK,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.440]   so moving on.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   Right now,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.740]   the flow that we have
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.100]   in Cloud Code
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.340]   is basically
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.900]   you start with your plan,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.320]   right?
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.200]   So you use your architect prompts
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.400]   and the moment you actually
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.460]   start in Cloud Code,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.240]   and maybe I can show you
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.900]   an example.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.240]   Let me see if I have one here.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.340]   Is this?
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:44.680]   OK.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.760]   This is maybe a bit too proprietary.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.460]   Wait, let me,
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.900]   we grab something
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.320]   from an inter-repositoring.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:15:00.840]   OK, so this is an example
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.560]   of a plan.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.500]   This is for a nonprofit
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.180]   that I'm in
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.680]   where we basically,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   we want to do some AI.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.400]   we want to use AI
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.780]   basically for managing
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.740]   our social media advertising.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.140]   So we wanted to create
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.440]   a Jinja front-end
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.460]   FastAPI pedantic.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.740]   We use OpenAI agent SDK,
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.920]   and this is the plan, right?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.620]   So you can see it's
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.480]   over a thousand lines.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.800]   It's like one hour
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.940]   of iterating with a GPT-5 Pro
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.000]   using our planning prompts.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.280]   We have our test plan.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.460]   As you can see,
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.440]   we have the test plan
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.000]   appended underneath our plan,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.040]   the plan MD, so to speak.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.220]   So the first part
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.400]   is focused more on
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.380]   like software architecture,
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.460]   data models,
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.720]   user stories, et cetera.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.880]   And the second part
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.300]   is focused on purely
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.980]   on the testing.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.900]   test-driven development
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.480]   of it all.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.500]   Then we have our
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.340]   clod.md file.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.900]   Very heavily focused
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.640]   on orchestration.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.120]   So in this setup,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.220]   your clod.md,
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.260]   let me, I can just
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.220]   start one here.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:19.240]   So in this setup,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.680]   your root agent,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.320]   so to speak,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.020]   is never actually
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.300]   going to write any code,
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.620]   right?
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.180]   All it does
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.020]   is orchestration
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.740]   and how it will
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.400]   always start
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.840]   is, you know,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.100]   let's say you have
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.980]   a clean repository
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.120]   and you want
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.520]   to start
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.160]   with the implementation
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.080]   of your plan.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.940]   You open it up,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.360]   you tell it
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.160]   root-clod.md,
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.020]   and then
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.640]   this isn't actually
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.540]   the root repository,
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.160]   right?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   Which is why
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.820]   it's not looking
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.400]   for the plan.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.880]   It's a sub-repository.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.980]   It's like just a prompt
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.740]   stash, so to speak.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.440]   But what it would do
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.280]   is if you tell it,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.260]   okay, read this plan,
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.380]   it will read the plan,
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.080]   then that's when
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.000]   the automation
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.400]   or the autonomous
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.740]   engineering comes into play.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.900]   So the first thing
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.420]   it will do
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.920]   is it will summon
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.500]   or it will execute
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.860]   the architect agent.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.760]   And what this will do
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.300]   is it will basically
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.760]   turn our plan,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.840]   our markdown file
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.260]   into a task list.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.240]   And for this task list,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   we have an MCP server.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.580]   So I wrote
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.000]   my own MCP server
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.120]   for this,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.300]   and this one is empty.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.620]   Let me grab one
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.060]   from a different
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.380]   repository real quick.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.660]   I believe this one.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.600]   So it's very simple.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.060]   It's a SQLite database.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.840]   And what it,
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.440]   so the architect,
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.260]   what it does
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:48.880]   is it will go
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.500]   through the plan
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.880]   and it will basically
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.360]   create vertically
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.760]   sliced task lists
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   for maximum
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.560]   parallelization.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.860]   and then you can see
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.620]   it's a little bit bigger.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.480]   Okay.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.560]   So it will basically
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.480]   create tasks
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.700]   and then assign them
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.280]   to agents
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.820]   and execute them
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.900]   in parallel, right?
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.420]   So what's very important
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.020]   is that every agent,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.320]   so we have one main agent
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.120]   to write code
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.840]   in this one.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.960]   So it's the executor,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.020]   it's the sonnet,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.660]   it's access to bash.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.040]   that basically has access
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.840]   to all the tools
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.340]   and it also has access
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.940]   to all our MCP servers
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.680]   that we use for this.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.660]   So we use playwright
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.100]   for like a runtime testing
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.920]   and then we have this
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.700]   core hub light,
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.800]   that's the MCP server.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.920]   And what it'll do
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.340]   is it gets a task.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.340]   The orchestrator agent
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.440]   is going to give it
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.800]   a contextual identity.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.360]   So when the orchestrator
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.520]   summons or invokes
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.680]   an executor,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.600]   it will give it
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.480]   a contextual identity
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.300]   and within that identity
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.500]   it will basically tell it
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.800]   this is your task,
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.460]   these are the files
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.060]   that you can edit,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.160]   these are the tests
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.960]   that you have to run
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.740]   and this is the output
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.560]   that you have to generate
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.500]   and the output
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   that it generates
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.060]   is a task artifact.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.320]   Let me see
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.200]   if I can find one here.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.320]   right, so it's always
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.540]   red to green
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.740]   test-driven development.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:28.680]   So it's very small.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.600]   Let me see if there's
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.080]   a better way
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.060]   to display this.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.020]   right, so we use UV,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.340]   we run tests
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.320]   and it will
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.120]   generate an artifact
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.300]   and after every time
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.640]   an executor agent runs,
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.420]   the orchestrator
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.540]   will always invoke
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.600]   a reviewer agent
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.880]   because you can only go
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.020]   so in our system
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.540]   in this MCP server
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.780]   which is being used
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.620]   by the orchestrator
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.840]   to do the task management,
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.520]   you can only go
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.340]   from
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.760]   so a completed task
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.880]   so the first iteration
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.960]   of writing code
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.400]   will always go
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.600]   to the status
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.580]   needs review
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.180]   and that's the machine state
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.000]   so even the orchestrator
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.840]   cannot simply
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.040]   move a task
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.120]   from like in progress
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.660]   to approved
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.220]   or completed,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.100]   it always has to go
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.540]   through in review
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.020]   and that means
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.020]   the orchestrator
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.820]   will trigger
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.680]   this reviewer agent
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.700]   and the reviewer agent
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.020]   basically checks
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.580]   two things,
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.920]   it checks the output
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.120]   of the
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.540]   executor agent
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.320]   so it will check
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.500]   it will read
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.060]   the artifact
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.420]   the artifact
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.240]   is basically
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.260]   a highly verbose
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.620]   summary
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.680]   of what the
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.700]   executor agent
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.300]   has done
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.000]   let me see
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.760]   I think the template
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.620]   should be
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.940]   in here somewhere
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.080]   right
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.620]   so this
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.460]   this is a completion report
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.620]   so
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.460]   task
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.520]   the task ID
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.900]   that they got
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.700]   from the orchestrator
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.360]   right
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200]   so the orchestrator
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.780]   will give
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.900]   the executor agent
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.060]   the task ID
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.920]   that's the contextual
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.100]   what do we call
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.580]   contextual identity
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.380]   and then
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.580]   I'm sorry
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.200]   when the agent
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.640]   is done
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.280]   it will create
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.180]   this artifact
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.760]   so the implementation
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.560]   context
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.220]   the stack
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.400]   the architecture
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.880]   adherence to the plan
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.160]   so every agent
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.940]   so every instance
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.160]   of this executor agent
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.840]   and remember
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.560]   we can run
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.420]   four in parallel
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.700]   we'll first read
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.540]   the plan
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.920]   it will read
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.040]   the framework guidelines
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.520]   it gets
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.600]   it gets
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.180]   from the orchestrator
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.840]   it gets
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.060]   a concrete list
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.540]   of all the
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.420]   files
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.100]   that it's able
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.460]   to edit
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.460]   so it will output
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.900]   in this summary
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.680]   so this artifact
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.260]   that we write
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.060]   to our SQLite
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.940]   database
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.620]   which is our
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.260]   mcp server
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.300]   all the files
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.840]   that it touched
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.760]   what it did
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.680]   what it built
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.360]   and the key decisions
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.760]   it made
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.400]   the test results
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.440]   passing tests
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.100]   coverage
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.700]   all tests
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.240]   passing
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.440]   validation handoff
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.900]   so ready for validation
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.440]   when it has
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:19.920]   the status
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.480]   that means
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.400]   it will be
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.200]   handed over
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.920]   to the
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.200]   to the viewer
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.560]   and then
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.260]   we have
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.420]   the
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.260]   actual
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.380]   outputs
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.060]   of the test
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.420]   right
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.320]   so what we
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.060]   mandate
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.860]   from these
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.840]   executor agents
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   is that
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.500]   they have to
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.480]   basically
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.440]   deliver a
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.580]   let me see
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.860]   search
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.520]   real quick
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.120]   right
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.340]   so this
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:48.520]   is
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.100]   kind of
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.420]   an important
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:49.720]   one
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.500]   business
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.960]   value
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.320]   truth
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.600]   gate
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.620]   why
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.400]   because
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.240]   these
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.800]   models
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.400]   will
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.820]   are
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.020]   very prone
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:58.420]   to reward
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:58.720]   hacking
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.580]   and
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.160]   you have
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.620]   to force
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:00.880]   them
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.940]   to show
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.400]   proof
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.420]   that
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.000]   the tests
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.860]   that they
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.300]   created
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.340]   so
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.340]   red to green
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.840]   test driven
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.240]   development
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.780]   so tests
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.360]   that they created
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:11.820]   the green
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.300]   tests
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:12.860]   especially
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.300]   in the
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.640]   phase
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   where they're
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.120]   testing
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.220]   stuff at
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.500]   runtime
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:16.700]   time
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.100]   so
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.460]   like
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:17.980]   live
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.540]   API
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:18.900]   key
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.260]   smoke
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:19.580]   test
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:19.920]   etc
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.300]   they have
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:21.660]   to deliver
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.100]   proof
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.580]   that what
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.060]   they did
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.920]   is actually
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.240]   real
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.980]   because if
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.960]   we don't
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.500]   do that
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.560]   then they
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.000]   will simply
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   use mock
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:28.840]   data
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.240]   and they'll
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.500]   be like
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:29.900]   yeah sure
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.400]   passed
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.820]   and not
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.080]   really
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.480]   like it
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:32.780]   didn't
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.880]   and then
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   after
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.760]   three hours
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.440]   of these
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.860]   agents
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.160]   running
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   autonomously
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.340]   you boot up
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:38.920]   your application
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.580]   and it won't even
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:39.900]   start
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.700]   because they just
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.020]   reward
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.560]   attack the whole
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:41.840]   thing
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.680]   and this
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.240]   kind of
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.360]   fixes that
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:47.900]   because
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.440]   the reviewer
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.780]   agent
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.320]   that comes
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.800]   after the
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.320]   executor
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:51.680]   agent
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.220]   is going
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.520]   to actually
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.020]   check the
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.300]   proof
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.380]   and it's
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.660]   going to
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.080]   review the
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.380]   code
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:55.700]   and it's
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:55.860]   going to
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.100]   run the
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.420]   tests
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:56.980]   and if
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.180]   it sees
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.380]   if the
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:23:59.680]   reviewer
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.000]   agent
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.820]   establishes
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.540]   that the
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:01.880]   tests
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.600]   are faulty
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.080]   then
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.100]   let's
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.380]   see
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.660]   quick
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.080]   then I
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.200]   will
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.640]   basically
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.360]   hand
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:13.620]   the
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.040]   task
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.660]   back
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.060]   over
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.820]   here we
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.040]   go
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.140]   sorry
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.460]   for all
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.560]   the
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:19.880]   scrolling
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.620]   so
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.180]   it will
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:22.480]   basically
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:22.860]   hand
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.000]   the
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.300]   task
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:23.600]   back
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:23.940]   over
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.280]   to
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.440]   the
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.920]   executor
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.240]   agent
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.020]   and it

[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:24.940]   of the time
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.440]   these will
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:25.840]   take quite
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.120]   a while
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.480]   and
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.040]   and
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.080]   when
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.860]   when
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:29.960]   you
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.200]   do it
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.620]   this way
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:30.900]   so
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.040]   you
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.260]   see
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.700]   like
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:31.900]   all
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.140]   these
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:32.580]   agents
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:32.860]   we're
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.040]   running
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.180]   in
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.400]   parallel
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:33.740]   for
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.120]   quite
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.300]   some
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.620]   time
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.140]   and
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.380]   the way
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.500]   that
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:36.620]   we
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:36.840]   keep
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:36.980]   it
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.340]   going
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.860]   is
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.060]   also
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:38.280]   quite
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.740]   important
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.520]   is
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.320]   through
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.940]   hooks
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.180]   so
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.880]   we
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.280]   have
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.560]   a few
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:46.840]   hooks
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.080]   right
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.300]   so
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:47.460]   we
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:47.820]   have
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.140]   one
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:50.440]   hook
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.280]   that's
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:51.540]   when

[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:52.900]   so
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.040]   when

[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:56.640]   like

[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.360]   agent
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.560]   you're

[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.660]   it'll
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:07.940]   do
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.260]   is
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:08.400]   it

[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.180]   it
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:09.560]   forces

[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.420]   this
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:14.760]   right

[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.500]   okay
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.000]   so
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.440]   it
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.980]   runs

[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.420]   and then
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.140]   debug
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.420]   it
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:10.860]   else
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.840]   like
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.100]   it'll
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:13.500]   go for
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:13.940]   two hours
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.180]   and
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.360]   it
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:14.660]   won't
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:14.920]   work
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.000]   and
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.300]   then
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.840]   there's
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.080]   a lot
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.340]   of
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:21.700]   just
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.140]   rules
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.680]   as to
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:24.860]   how
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.020]   the
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.440]   coordination
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.980]   has to
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.140]   take
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.520]   place
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.540]   and
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:27.900]   this
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.140]   is
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.560]   very
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:28.920]   important
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.420]   so
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.020]   it always
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.260]   goes
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.620]   from

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.780]   these are
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.020]   all the

[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.240]   just to be
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.440]   clear
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:41.680]   as you

[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   basically
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.600]   it resets
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:47.840]   it
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.200]   and

[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.860]   it
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.040]   will
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.400]   send

[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.060]   like
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.320]   a

[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:00.940]   basically
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.360]   alter

[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.840]   and
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.100]   then

[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.460]   and
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:07.620]   then
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.000]   we also
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.400]   have

[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:14.460]   think
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:14.600]   of

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.340]   it
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:12.500]   just

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.420]   we
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:21.720]   only
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.340]   implemented
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.020]   this
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.520]   kind
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.720]   of

[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.840]   that's
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.100]   something
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.280]   we
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:29.680]   implemented
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.140]   today
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.960]   so
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.460]   I
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:31.640]   haven't
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:31.780]   had
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:31.940]   a

[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.420]   to
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:32.720]   really
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.740]   try
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.020]   yet
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.820]   I'm
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.060]   going
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.340]   through
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.680]   those
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.180]   motions
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.140]   now
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.260]   and
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:38.440]   so
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.660]   far
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:38.880]   it's
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.100]   actually
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.300]   been
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.540]   really
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:39.800]   good
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.580]   because
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:41.680]   of

[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.560]   right
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:44.840]   so
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.100]   it
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:45.300]   has

[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:01.920]   hacking
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.140]   so
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.220]   I'm
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.400]   quite
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.800]   optimistic

[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.300]   and
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:04.380]   then
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:04.500]   we
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.680]   also
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.920]   added

[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:08.840]   basically
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.780]   is
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.040]   just

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.400]   basically
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.240]   a

[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.480]   it
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:16.640]   will

[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.400]   even
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:18.500]   if

[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:20.940]   the same
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.480]   stuff

[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.000]   that's
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.260]   probably
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:29.720]   because

[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:12.960]   right
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.380]   let's
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.080]   see
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:15.740]   next
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.700]   question
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.540]   I saw
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.460]   was
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:18.640]   have
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:18.780]   you
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.160]   considered
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.620]   breaking
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:19.900]   the
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.300]   validation
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.620]   into
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.060]   layers
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.540]   approached
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:21.780]   by
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.140]   different
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.640]   agents
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.520]   yes
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.280]   and we
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.000]   I mean
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.180]   we
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.060]   kind of
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.820]   do that
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.380]   it depends
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:29.700]   a bit
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.340]   so we
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:30.700]   also have
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.000]   like a
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.420]   playwright
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.640]   debugger
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.060]   so
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.120]   so
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.480]   for
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.840]   some
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.240]   things
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.180]   especially
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:40.420]   like
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.720]   runtime
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.180]   issues
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.460]   the
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.680]   orchestrator
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.580]   can choose
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:44.940]   to hand
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.200]   off
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:45.780]   to a
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.220]   playwright
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:46.760]   debugger
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.420]   and this
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.340]   agent
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:49.780]   is then
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.340]   well
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.100]   you know
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.500]   specialized
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.400]   is a big
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:52.720]   word
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.140]   obviously
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:53.460]   it's just
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:53.860]   a prompt
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.120]   right
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.420]   but
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.660]   focused
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.280]   on
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.200]   debugging
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   issues
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.200]   using
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:42:59.420]   the
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:42:59.960]   playwright
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.620]   mcp
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.420]   and
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.080]   for our
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:02.700]   frontend
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.520]   so we
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:03.880]   also have
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.040]   a frontend
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.880]   agent
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.480]   stack
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.100]   kind of
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.400]   the same
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:08.920]   principle
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.880]   they were
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.340]   like this
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.100]   it's a bit
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:12.440]   different
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:12.900]   because it's
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.140]   like
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.100]   the frontend
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.300]   it's very
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:15.640]   hard
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.400]   at least
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:16.680]   you know
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.100]   I'm not
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.360]   good at
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.760]   frontend
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.240]   so maybe
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.480]   I should
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:18.820]   start with
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.080]   that
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.560]   definitely
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.020]   frontend
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:21.420]   design
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.320]   but it's
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.760]   been very
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.140]   hard to
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.280]   like
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:24.640]   just use
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:24.800]   like
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.160]   design
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.660]   tokens
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.280]   and stuff
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:26.780]   to keep
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.220]   everything
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:27.660]   like
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:27.940]   looking
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.260]   good
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.680]   so we
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.440]   kind of
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.860]   went through
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.380]   this more
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.480]   esoteric
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.140]   approach
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.940]   we have
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:35.180]   like this
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.420]   visual
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.100]   anthropologist
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:36.500]   which will
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:36.980]   basically
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.380]   so it
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:41.640]   takes
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.200]   screenshots
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.900]   and then
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.360]   it just
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.020]   ingests
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:44.600]   the screenshots
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.120]   of the
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.540]   frontend
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.260]   to make
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.580]   design
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.260]   decisions
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.800]   so yes
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.140]   sorry
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.040]   that was a bit
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.420]   of a tangent
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:51.900]   but yes
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.480]   we do
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.060]   use specialized
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.860]   agents
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.420]   or sub
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:55.720]   agents
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.400]   rather for
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.460]   review
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.160]   if it's
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.580]   necessary
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.380]   and usually
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:43:59.760]   that will
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.240]   be the
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:00.440]   data
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.000]   reviewer
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.620]   if it's
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.120]   specifically
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.880]   for stuff
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.420]   that's like
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.120]   business
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:04.460]   logic
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:04.860]   related
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.460]   like
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:05.800]   synthetic
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.080]   data
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.300]   that we
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.720]   generate
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.340]   and we
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:07.460]   have
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:07.920]   frontend
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.520]   architect
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.320]   and then
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:09.440]   we have
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:09.880]   a playwright
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.620]   debugger
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.100]   and that's
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:11.420]   kind of
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:11.800]   all we
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.060]   have
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:12.280]   but
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.540]   maybe
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:13.760]   down
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.060]   the road
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.280]   it would
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:14.660]   make sense
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:14.920]   to have
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.140]   more
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.020]   I don't know
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.380]   awesome
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.280]   scanning through
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.560]   I guess
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.400]   the last
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.340]   question I
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.020]   see is
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:24.500]   for the
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:24.780]   local
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.480]   documentation
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:25.820]   which
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.040]   there's
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:26.200]   a lot
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.480]   of people
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.920]   chiming in
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.600]   and agreeing
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:28.940]   on that
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.360]   approach
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:29.740]   and they
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.240]   love that
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:30.900]   do you
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.200]   do any
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.520]   sort of
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.140]   indexing
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:32.640]   of that
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.280]   or how
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:33.660]   do you
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.320]   manage
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.660]   like
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.040]   which
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.500]   documentation
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.100]   is relevant
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:36.520]   when
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:36.920]   for what
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.460]   context
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.640]   yeah
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.120]   so
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.960]   we have
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.740]   the index
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.040]   file
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.340]   right
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:41.500]   so
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.160]   documentation
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:42.580]   we have
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:42.920]   the index
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.300]   directory
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:43.920]   sorry
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.340]   the index
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:44.660]   file
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.580]   and
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.520]   orchestrator
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   I believe
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.860]   also has
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.100]   an overview
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:54.640]   yeah
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.120]   so we have
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.620]   documentation
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.300]   guidance
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.180]   shit
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.720]   where we
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.060]   kind of
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:00.720]   tell the
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.200]   orchestrator
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.260]   which documentation
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:02.860]   is available
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.320]   to it
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.500]   and then
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:04.920]   based on
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.220]   that
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.460]   it
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:05.880]   will
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.120]   read
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.480]   the index
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:06.780]   file
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.260]   and
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.860]   inform
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.220]   the
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:09.520]   sub
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:09.940]   agents
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.500]   in the
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:10.780]   prompt
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.100]   when they're
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.520]   invoked
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.400]   what documentation
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.160]   they should
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:13.440]   use
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.960]   have you
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.300]   considered
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.280]   an archivist
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.180]   role
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.960]   or
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.780]   specifically
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.140]   like
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:20.700]   context
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.240]   and documentation
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:21.860]   management
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.740]   who can
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.240]   like
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:24.740]   take that
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:24.960]   off
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.360]   of the
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.060]   orchestrators
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.000]   context
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.300]   window
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.080]   yeah
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.660]   I mean
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.100]   that would
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.500]   make a lot
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:30.880]   of sense
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.520]   I mean
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.000]   I think
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.500]   that what
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:33.840]   I have
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.280]   here is
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:34.600]   like
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.400]   version
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.600]   0.01
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.260]   which is
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:37.520]   probably
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.720]   going to
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.100]   get washed
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.300]   away
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:38.680]   by model
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.140]   improvements
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:39.500]   in a few
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:39.840]   months
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.100]   but I'm
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.740]   100% sure
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.420]   there are
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.040]   a thousand
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.440]   ways
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.340]   that you
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:44.660]   can do
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.000]   what I'm
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.320]   doing
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.020]   better
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.480]   by
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.140]   having
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:47.520]   more
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.060]   granular
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.660]   task

[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:50.760]   agents
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.100]   and a
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:51.260]   better
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.660]   system
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:51.880]   to

[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.440]   100%
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.380]   are you
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:55.580]   going to
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.060]   open source
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:56.420]   this
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.320]   oh yeah
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:58.920]   I think
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.120]   so
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:45:59.340]   yeah

[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.280]   thanks
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.920]   I built
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.240]   my own
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:03.500]   version
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.280]   of this
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:04.960]   but yours
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.280]   is
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.860]   much
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.640]   bigger
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.120]   I think
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.420]   you've
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:07.720]   put more
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:07.980]   time
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.220]   in it
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.540]   than I
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:08.720]   did
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.660]   and I
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:10.800]   like
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.000]   what you

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.240]   I hope
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.340]   it works
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:14.800]   I hope
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.160]   it doesn't
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.540]   just work
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:15.800]   on my
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.100]   machine
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.460]   it should
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:16.600]   be

[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.660]   but I
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:21.760]   think
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:21.880]   the

[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:22.660]   pretty
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.000]   interesting
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.440]   I
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:24.580]   think
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:24.700]   there
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:24.800]   is
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:24.980]   something
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.240]   to be
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.440]   said

[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.520]   a
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.720]   huge
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:26.880]   part
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:26.920]   of
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.020]   that
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:27.300]   400
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:27.740]   messages
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.000]   that
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.220]   led
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:28.360]   to
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:28.700]   this
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.820]   call
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.420]   was
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:30.600]   that
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:30.900]   like
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.300]   there
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.460]   can

[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:32.960]   which
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.060]   I
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.280]   think
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:33.980]   there's
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.580]   probably

[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.140]   element
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.400]   of

[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.000]   going
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.360]   on
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.880]   but
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.520]   I
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:38.760]   think
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.080]   overall
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.260]   just
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:39.480]   to see
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:39.840]   somebody's
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.120]   workflow
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.260]   is
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:40.500]   always
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:40.840]   interesting
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.080]   every
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.280]   time
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.380]   and
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:41.640]   I'll
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:41.820]   watch
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:41.920]   it
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.060]   every
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.280]   time
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:42.500]   so
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:42.940]   yeah
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.580]   those
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:43.640]   are
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:43.760]   my

[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.420]   I
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.840]   think
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.060]   or
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.360]   what I
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:58.500]   see

[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.240]   is
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:01.640]   something
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.300]   kind
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:02.500]   of

[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   where
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.440]   it's
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:09.860]   like

[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.080]   is
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.640]   probably
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.080]   not
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:15.200]   going

[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:39.480]   that's
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:39.680]   something
