[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   what would be the amount of protein that you would have everybody eat in terms of a number
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.020]   of grams per pound or kilogram of body weight? That's actually an easy question. One gram per
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.960]   pound, ideal body weight. Total body weight, not lean body weight. Ideal body weight, actually,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.900]   where you want to be. If an individual is 200 pounds, but would prefer to be 150 pounds,
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.940]   then I would have them eat towards their ideal body weight. There's no evidence that a higher
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.020]   protein diet is detrimental to kidney health, to bone health. And we use these terms loosely,
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.340]   like a high protein diet, when we have to recognize that 0.8 grams per kg is a low protein diet.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.100]   So where did the idea come from that if you eat, say, one gram of quality protein per pound of
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.440]   ideal body weight, that you're going to get gout, you're going to have liver issues,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500]   you're going to have all sorts of issues? Where did that idea come from?
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.060]   Frankly, I'm not sure. But the conversation around dietary protein has probably been the
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.360]   most controversial. Why do you think that is? I mean, we're not trying to get political here.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:20.680]   I do have some ideas, but I won't share them. But I do feel as if nutrition is not just science.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.500]   Nutrition is complicated because it's something that people tie emotion to. They tie religion to.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.360]   There's a lot that goes into dietary protein and food recommendations in general.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.220]   But it sounds like we can safely say that if you eat one gram of protein per pound of ideal body
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.680]   weight, that you're not going to cause liver damage or get gout or increase your risk of cancer,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.000]   right? My understanding is that even if it comes from red meat, there's no increase in risk of cancer.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.540]   Is that right? Well, here's what I would say to that. I would say that this idea about red meat and
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.340]   cancer, number one, we would have to even define what kind of cancers that we're talking about.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.740]   There's many different types of cancers and there's many different causes. It would be important to
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.580]   understand what risk factors are. And a primary risk factor to many cancers is obesity.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.920]   The question then becomes, how do we design a diet that mitigates obesity? The evidence is also very
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.060]   clear that a more protein forward diet optimizes body composition. And you combine that with resistance
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.280]   training and you will see a tremendous amount of change. I worked on some of these early studies
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.660]   studies. And I'll share with you some of the early studies. And this came out of Don Lehman's lab
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.800]   with the University of Illinois.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.180]   Both you and Lane Norton both worked there.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.560]   Yes.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.600]   Did you overlap there?
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.000]   We did.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.480]   Okay.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.620]   What was he like?
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.300]   So let's just say he sat in the back of the class and I sat in the front.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.040]   Okay. All right. There, you heard it. Shots fired.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.600]   And all kidding aside, Lane is a very, he's like my brother. We've known each other for
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.260]   20 some years.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260]   Yeah. He's a very popular guest, a former guest on this podcast and a very spirited guy.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.080]   And I'd like, I just like to say, I don't know why his skin looks that good, but whatever.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.580]   So I worked on-
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.020]   Love you, Lane.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.980]   I worked on, yes, we do. I worked on some of these early studies and this was,
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.640]   these studies were some of the first studies to come out about dietary protein, nutrition,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.680]   and resistance training. In fact, to my knowledge and to, I think, the knowledge of many of my
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.920]   colleagues, this was the first study. And what it was, it was a 12-month study, 130 overweight men
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   and women. So it was robust. And basically what they did is they had two groups. One group was a
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.620]   food guide pyramid diet. So it was 55 grams of carbohydrates, a RDA of protein, which was 0.8
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.180]   grams per kg, and 30% fat. 30% fat was in both groups. The second group was 40% carbohydrates.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.800]   This is, remember the zone diet, 40-30-30?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.180]   Yeah. I liked that diet.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.660]   Okay. I mean, there's evidence-
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.800]   Ish. I mean, I don't follow it anymore, but I tried it for a little while.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.340]   And it works great. And there's some evidence to support that that is a great ratio for people.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.580]   Coming off the low-fat era of the late 90s, the zone diet felt like the best thing ever because it
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.800]   was like, oh, you know, you can enjoy some fats and wow, your satiety has improved and you get
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.980]   stronger. You just feel better when you're ingesting some ideally quality fats. That's my experience.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.800]   Yes. And also we know that it influences hormonal status. You don't want to push fats too low.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.440]   So the second group had a 40-30-30 split. So it was 40 grams of carbohydrates, 30 grams of protein,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.800]   30 grams or 30% fat. So these are all percentages.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.500]   Yeah. 40%...
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.940]   Now, we didn't talk so much about the distribution, but what is really important to understand is they
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.140]   were isocaloric. So they both had the same calories. The difference was the percentage of where the
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.340]   calories came from and how they were given. And there was actually four different arms to this.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.980]   So there was individuals that exercised and individuals that didn't.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.720]   Okay. So either zone diet or let's call it, I hate to say this, but more standard American diet.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.660]   No, it was. And that's how it was designed.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.140]   Standard American versus zone diet.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.600]   Yes. So it was designed that way.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.680]   And then exercising or non-exercising for each of the...
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.000]   For this 12-month study.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And by the way, I had to pack a bunch of meals. It was not pretty. And I had to do
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.300]   urine analysis. It was terrible. But anyway, this is besides the point. So the first group had
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:40.520]   a protein distribution of 10 grams in the morning, 15 at lunch, and 45 at dinner.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.680]   And this...
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.440]   Kind of standard American diet.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.960]   So that mirrors...
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.540]   Steak for dinner.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.080]   Exactly.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   Yeah, some cereal for breakfast with a little bit of milk, and then for lunch, like a sandwich.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.680]   Exactly. And so this mirrors what people do. The other group had 45 grams of protein at
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.320]   that first meal.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.540]   Five, six eggs.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.960]   Five, six eggs. 35 grams of protein at lunch, and 35 grams of protein at dinner.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.260]   So chicken breast and a salad at lunch with a little piece of toast, and then at dinner,
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.620]   how much?
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.640]   It was 35 grams.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.860]   All right. A piece of fish and some rice and a vegetable.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.160]   But it was an even distribution. So what you're seeing here is now these meals are meeting a leucine
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.900]   threshold of muscle protein synthesis.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.860]   Now, it's a hundred and... This is collectively 130 individuals, and they were older. I think that
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.740]   they were all in their 40s or beyond.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.720]   If we just compare first the groups that did not exercise, two different diets, what did
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.360]   they see? What did you see? You participated in this study.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.520]   Yeah. Yes, I did.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.700]   And I say, unfortunately, no, I won't. But what was so interesting is that those individuals,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.920]   everybody lost weight. So the average weight loss... Gosh, I wish I had better handwriting,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.340]   but I'm a doctor, and so it's pretty bad. The average weight loss was 24% greater in the high
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.460]   protein group. So they lost 24%.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.380]   Okay.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.680]   And you said it was isocaloric between the two groups. That's right. But was it subcaloric
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.440]   overall? I mean, people were ingesting... It was. It was a five... That's a very smart... Yes. It was 500
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.800]   calories less.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.000]   Than what they needed to maintain body weight. Correct.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Okay. Got it. So 24% more weight loss total.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.420]   Total.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.600]   In the group that distributed their protein evenly and followed the so-called zone diet, 40, 30, 30.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:29.480]   They lost more fat than the high carbohydrate group. So the high protein group lost a total of 16 pounds
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   versus the calorie controlled group lost 11 pounds.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.580]   Of fat.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.760]   Of fat, which is great. Everyone's at home thinking, this is wonderful.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.780]   Isocaloric.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.040]   Isocaloric. But the thing here is the lean body mass change. So again, this was done using DEXA,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.220]   and we know DEXA only looks at lean body mass.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:53.380]   You mentioned DEXA earlier. Just very briefly, is DEXA... How does DEXA work? Not at a mechanistic
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.400]   level. What does it look like? I go into the clinic. Am I floating in water? Am I holding...
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:57.660]   No, you're getting scanned.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.900]   I'm holding the paddles.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.500]   Well, you might be because you're Andrew Huberman, but...
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.420]   No, no, no. But you hold the paddles and you're standing outside. It's... What's it...
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.240]   So a DEXA, you just lay on, depending on the machine, you can just lay on this machine and
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.760]   it's a dual X-ray and it measures bone, fat, and then lean body mass.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.620]   Okay. That's sufficient for this conversation. Great.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:24.860]   So the lean body mass lost, and again, this is everything other than bone and body fat.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.960]   So that was 34%.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.000]   In which group?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.640]   In the standard American diet group.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:30.920]   Okay.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.860]   Versus 26% in the high protein group.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.740]   Now, where it gets fascinating, so what the big takeaway is, is understanding that protein
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.960]   had a sparing effect.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.940]   Protein protected muscle.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.160]   Yes.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.420]   More body fat loss.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:46.680]   Yes.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.840]   At the same caloric amounts.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   Yes.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.680]   Same amount of deficit relative to body weight.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.120]   Right.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.160]   In this group, exercise was not introduced.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:04.640]   So this was purely the food guide pyramid, changing protein in the morning versus having it at two
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.940]   small meals and then having it at dinner.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.740]   And did they emphasize what we're calling high-quality protein?
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.100]   They did.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.480]   Okay.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.860]   That is also very important.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.380]   Meat, fish, eggs, chicken, et cetera.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:13.620]   Yes.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.240]   They did.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.840]   So then this led to another study.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.720]   So then the second study was a two-by-two design.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.320]   And this is-
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.560]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.360]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.220]   In that previous study, what was the effect of exercise between the two groups?
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.240]   So we didn't, they didn't do exercise.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.540]   Got it.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:26.740]   Okay.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:26.840]   Sorry.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.480]   That was my fault.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.920]   They did not do exercise.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.720]   They were just doing whatever that it was that they were doing.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:41.080]   But what was so important to understand was that this set the stage for this idea that protein
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   had a sparing effect.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:50.220]   And then following that, the other study, so then there was a series of a few other studies.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.320]   The second study looked at diet and exercise.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.740]   So this combined effect.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.400]   So this was one of the first studies, and this was 48 women with a BMI of 33, 46 years
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:01.600]   old.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.680]   So this is your post-peri, post-menopausal woman who was either in one of four treatment
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.800]   groups, a low-protein group, low-protein with exercise, high-protein, high-protein with
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.260]   exercise.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.840]   The low-protein group was defined as the RDA, 0.8 grams.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.860]   The high-protein group was defined as 1.6 grams kg.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.920]   So starting to approach that one gram per pound.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.160]   It's about 0.7 grams per pound.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.780]   So starting to get there, but not quite there.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:43.660]   So this was a 16-week study, and what they found overall was that the high-protein group
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:53.360]   lost 18% more body fat and 25% less lean mass overall, and 12% more total body weight.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:02.440]   And so now we start moving into this synergistic effect of dietary protein and resistance training.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.220]   And it was the type of exercise that they performed there resistance training?
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.000]   This is the good news.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.520]   It didn't take much.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.060]   It was five days a week of walking 30 minutes and two days a week of resistance training with
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.140]   just body weight.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.400]   It was like yoga activity.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.840]   So air squats, down dogs, some warrior poses, maybe some handstand attempts.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.960]   So yeah, no one is doing handstands.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.040]   Rob, are you doing handstands?
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.440]   No one's doing handstands.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.420]   I've been to some yoga classes where I look to the sides of me, and people are doing some
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.340]   pretty difficult things.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.760]   Very impressive.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.020]   Planches and things like that.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.920]   Definitely not me.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.760]   Do not invite me.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   Life is better this way.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.820]   I'm not going to those classes.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:45.340]   But 16 weeks, they did a high-protein with protein and exercise.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:54.140]   Those individuals, so now, so the study, the group that I just mentioned, this was dietary
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.060]   intervention alone.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.620]   With exercise, high-protein plus exercise, very simple exercise.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.740]   So if someone is listening to this and they're thinking, what can I do to make very practical
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.640]   changes to massively impact my life outside of hormone replacement, outside of any super
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.120]   subliminal, outside of anything, diet and exercise has a dramatic effect.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:24.000]   Those individuals that were doing 1.6 grams per kg, which is 0.7 grams per pound of body
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   weight plus exercise, lost 46% more body weight.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.580]   That's substantial.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:43.680]   60% more fat and 40% less fat-free mass from organs, muscle, whatever that is, compared
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.660]   to the low-protein group plus exercise.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.380]   And was it subcaloric?
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.360]   Were they below maintenance weight?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.800]   It was.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.080]   It was.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.940]   So they're eating to ideal body weight, but still 500 calories or so below their current
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.640]   caloric needs to maintain body weight.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:58.700]   Yes.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.700]   They're eating to ideal body weight.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.700]   They're eating to ideal body weight.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   They're eating to ideal body weight.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.700]   They're eating to ideal body weight.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.700]   They're eating to ideal body weight.
