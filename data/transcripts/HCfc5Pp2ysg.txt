[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   There's this
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.560]   kind of thing that happens in
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.820]   Biology called evolution and a lot of people think evolution is this continuous process, but it's not
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.120]   evolution is this process by which there is some significant growth for a period of time and
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960]   Then there is an extinction event or an external force
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.320]   That causes what ultimately becomes what's called punctuated equilibrium
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.040]   So the whole kind of system resets and then the healthier stronger species
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.800]   Survive and they grow and they persist and if you look at the
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.600]   first chart Nick that I pulled up this will just show you guys past extinction events large amounts of
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.760]   biomass over the past half billion years get wiped out when these extinction events occur and
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.800]   then evolution occurs because the species that can survive the extinction of hand persists in the environment and they grow and
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   That's how evolution kind of actually takes place is there's an external force that changes what survives and what doesn't it's kind of a testing
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.760]   Force if you look at federal spending and this is a crazy link
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560]   but here's federal spending over the last couple of decades and I
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.860]   Would argue that many of the agencies?
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.560]   Much of the bureaucracy many of the jobs created many of the spending programs many of the operating models many of the behaviors
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.880]   can kind of be viewed as a
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.960]   species or species within this ecosystem that have kind of grown a lot over the last few decades and
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.040]   I think what Trump's mandate was by the people
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.100]   and people don't want to hear this and they don't like it, but his mandate was to be kind of the extinction event and
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880]   whatever agencies
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   whatever operating processes
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   whatever individuals
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.400]   whatever bureaucratic systems exist within the federal government that can withstand the scrutiny of
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.320]   The individuals that Trump is going to put in charge of each of these agencies
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.560]   That they can survive and they can come out the other end
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.280]   There is certainly some degree of strength and resilience and hardiness. This is not about right or wrong
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.160]   This is a deserve to exist if they think this is gonna bring in this is gonna bring in the most
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.440]   Disruptive force that federal agencies have ever seen and the intention with Trump isn't defined
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.720]   Some person to keep running things the way they have been run in the past his
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.600]   mandate from the people who elected him based on the message he put out there is to do the opposite which is to go in and
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.280]   Be as disruptive and damaging and destructive as possible. And whatever comes out the other side will be stronger will be harder and
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.640]   Theoretically will be you know more resilient and I think that that's the event that's underway
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   Now the people who are getting exactly what they want in
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.600]   Trump's candidacies are the Democrats they were saying Trump is gonna put a bunch of crazy lunatics in office and he's gonna make them the
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.200]   Cabinet and they're good and there and now they're able to kind of clap their hands and say we told you so we told you
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.560]   So and I'm not sure that if they're really getting the message
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.680]   Which is that the intention here isn't to keep things running the way they have been running
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.400]   But to really fundamentally test the systems and test the systems with the most challenging
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.200]   Oppositional forces the systems have ever been tested by which is the candidates or the individuals that he's putting in charge of each of these
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.720]   Agencies, so I'm not saying it's right or wrong one way or the other
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.760]   But I'm making an observation that this is gonna be kind of an extinction level event
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.040]   That Trump's decisions on who he's putting in place. I think are gonna drive an outcome on the other end
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000]   That's gonna make the government look very different and I you know
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.400]   I'm not gonna sit around and say this person's good this person's bad because I don't think the point is to find someone that's quote
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.880]   Qualified to do the job
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.480]   The intention is actually quite different and the outcome may actually be positive for America if you fast-forward a couple of years in
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.760]   some cases and there's some cases where things could get really messed up and people could suffer and jobs will be lost and all sorts
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   of bad things will happen, but
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.040]   We cannot continue the way we have to with respect to federal spending with respect to federal spending
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.800]   bureaucracy and inefficiency in the federal government and so something has to happen and if this is the path by which this gets resolved in
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.960]   the limited window that's in front of
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.000]   This this particular administration, which is probably two years, maybe four. Maybe this is what has to happen
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.640]   Shabbat, where do you stand on?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880]   freeberg's interesting
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   Metaphor here that we're sending meteors into each of these departments to blow them up and see if they survive an extinction level
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.200]   Event I saw you nodding. Do you think this is an interesting framing great take? I have nothing to add to Friedberg state
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   Got it. Who's your favorite? Yeah, you asked me the question. I answered who's your favorite?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.280]   Well, I think let's take you on and Vivek off the table because that's an obvious one that we're behind since the beginning. Yeah
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.000]   And we know and we all support the idea who's not against more efficiency
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.680]   I mean, you have to be an idiot to be against efficiency. It's like the easiest one to say you love
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   I think the highest beta pick so far has been Bobby Kennedy. I think the second highest beta pick is
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.680]   Matt gates
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.960]   Explain highest beta pick in this context, please. I think the third is Tulsi Gabbard
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.640]   That there is the potential for an
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:10.040]   Enormously positive two or three Sigma outcome, but there's also the chance that it can really not work. Hmm
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.320]   That was exactly why I picked Bobby Kennedy because he's gonna shake it up
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.600]   Right Peter Thiel just did this podcast with barry weiss and it was fantastic by the way, highly recommend highly recommend. He's awesome. Yeah, the
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.360]   One of the great things he said is that he was talking about science
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.520]   But I think the example works here as well, which is that we didn't have enough skepticism and we had too much dogma
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.560]   he was talking about sort of like the the death of science and
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.960]   I think that that idea applies here as well, which is that the federal bureaucracy has not really been challenged
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   and Vivek put out a very
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.240]   Compelling post on X where
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.560]   He basically said like what when you on the one hand there's going to be radical transparency
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   but on the other hand, there's a lot of
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.520]   Case law that we can use to kind of try to really dismantle
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.360]   the government apparatus and they're putting themselves on a shot clock to do it by
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.800]   2026 for the 250th anniversary, so I think I'm really predisposed to this idea that
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.560]   It'll force the government to be very resilient at the end of this process and I think that's a good thing and it'll probably be
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.840]   Very different than what it is on the way in and I think that that can be very positive
