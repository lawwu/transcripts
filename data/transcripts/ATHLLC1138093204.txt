[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hey everyone. In this episode, we discuss the crypto platform BlockFi,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.440]   and since recording it, a lot has happened in the news. As of today, November 15th,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   2022, BlockFi is no longer allowing customers to withdraw their own crypto,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.360]   so all users, myself included, are stuck in a very frustrating situation.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.760]   Needless to say, I'm not happy with the company, and any recommendation you might hear for them
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.200]   in this episode should be ignored and considered outdated. Okay, on to the episode. A quick word
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.480]   from our sponsor today. Hello and welcome to a special episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   upgrading your life, money, and travel. So what's this special episode all about? Well, there was a
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.440]   lot in the news recently. A new quick and easy way to earn Southwest Companion Pass for a whole year,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   points devaluations from Hyatt and Marriott, and a big BlockFi settlement with the SEC.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   So, with all that happening, I thought it'd be worth doing an episode today to talk through it
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.640]   all, and I also just wanted to share some recommendations from my recent weekend vacation.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.800]   So, let's do it. First, I want to talk about the amazing deal going on right now with Southwest
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.560]   Companion Pass. For those of you who don't know, Southwest Airlines' highest elite status is called
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.640]   Companion Pass, and it lets you name a person who can fly free any time you purchase a ticket,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.080]   even if you pay with points. You just have to pay the taxes. And you can change your companion up to
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.520]   three times a year. I've had Companion Pass a few times over the years, and I've used it to fly with
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.720]   my wife all over the U.S. to Hawaii, Aruba, Cabo, and though I know Southwest flies to Turks and
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.920]   Caicos, I'm pretty disappointed we never got to use it there. Anyways, Companion Pass has to be
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.200]   one of the best travel hacks out there, and it's never been easier to get than it is right now.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.560]   And that's because for all three Chase Consumer Southwest cards, that's their Plus, Premier,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.640]   and Priority cards, if you spend $5,000 in the first three months, you get Companion Pass through
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.880]   February 28th, 2023. And if you're interested and you want to help me and the show out, you can sign
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   up for any of those cards at allthehacks.com/southwest. Oh, and you get 30,000 Southwest
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.480]   points after spending $5,000, which means you'll end up with about $500 worth of points and Companion
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.440]   Pass. I don't know how long this offer will last, and honestly, if we weren't having a baby in June,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.240]   I'd 100% be getting this card. Okay, moving on to some less exciting news in the points world,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   Hyatt is making some changes that on the whole aren't that great. Specifically, 70 of their
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.000]   hotels are moving to a higher award category, meaning you're going to need to use more points
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.480]   each night to book them. While this might seem like a pretty small number of properties,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.080]   and it is, it just happens to be some of their best properties. Places like the Ventana in Big Sur,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   the Andaz in Maui, and Park Hyatt's in Kyoto, Paris, Sydney, and other cities around the world.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.520]   So that sucks, but the silver lining is that even with these changes, compared to other hotel
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.760]   programs, Hyatt's award chart is still so generous, and the most you're going to have to pay for their
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.880]   highest tier of luxury hotels is only 35 to 45,000 points a night. Yes, that might be 30% more points
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.160]   than before, but it's still pretty good. And if you're looking at what that same number of Chase
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   points would get you booking in their portal, since Chase and Hyatt are transfer partners,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.480]   it'd only be 500 to 675 bucks. Yes, that's expensive for a hotel night. In fact, I'm not
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   even sure I've ever spent that much on a hotel night, but many of these properties regularly go
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.960]   for well over a thousand dollars a night, so it still can be a great deal. Okay, so it always
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.320]   sucks when your points are worth less, but I know I'll still be transferring Chase points to Hyatt
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.160]   to book these amazing hotels around the world. And this change looks like nothing compared to
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   what's coming for Marriott. For anyone who missed it, starting sometime in March, Marriott is moving
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.720]   to a dynamic pricing system where the points you need per night will fluctuate with the market rate
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   for hotels. That effectively means that amazing deals in places like Bora Bora or the Maldives
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   will probably be gone forever. Now, despite the change coming next month, Marriott did say that
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.040]   most of their hotels won't cost more than their peak pricing in 2022. But one, what does most mean?
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   It seems pretty vague to me. And two, come 2023, it's game over. In next week's episode, I'm joined
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.280]   by Points and Miles expert Richard Kerr, and we're going to talk a bit about what's going on
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.800]   with Marriott, so definitely tune in for that. What's my takeaway? Well, I was a dedicated Starwood
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.240]   traveler and transitioned that loyalty to Marriott since they merged. But honestly, I think I might
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.200]   be going all in on a transition to Hyatt this year. To be fair, we're having a baby in June,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   so all in doesn't really mean that much. I might only have a dozen nights all year,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.440]   but I probably want to start making that transition sometime, so I might as well start now.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.520]   Next, I want to talk about BlockFi. I think you all know I'm a huge fan. I have a lot of money in
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.080]   my BlockFi account and they're a sponsor of the show, so I feel like I have to address their big
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.680]   news this week. But before I do, I want to clarify that everything I'm saying is my own opinion.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.000]   I haven't consulted with BlockFi on it, and they certainly didn't ask me to talk about this.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.480]   Okay, so the main headline is that BlockFi has agreed to pay $100 million in a settlement with
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   the SEC and state regulators over their high-yield interest account. And they have finally been
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.040]   provided with some clarity on a path forward to offering their product in a compliant way.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   There's a lot more context to that, so I'll link to everything in the show notes.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.080]   But in my opinion, this is pretty good news for the crypto industry and the future of these
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   products. But what about in the short term? Well, in the interim, they're going to be halting all
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.320]   interest account opening for new customers and preventing all existing customers from making
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.240]   any additional deposits. However, any existing balances you have right now will continue to
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.360]   earn interest. As part of this process, they're going to be registering their new high-yield
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.120]   product, BlockFi Yield, with the SEC in line with this new guidance they've gotten. And they're
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.840]   going to plan to make it available soon, and all BlockFi interest accounts today will convert over
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.320]   to BlockFi Yield accounts. But they haven't provided much more clarity than that. If you're
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   not in the US, good news, you can continue to sign up and make deposits as you want.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   This whole thing reminds me a lot of how Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb were operating in a gray area
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.720]   and chose to just keep going and launching their products, even though they weren't
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.600]   sure whether they were allowed, or in some cases, thought they weren't but thought they might get
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.720]   away with it. Except the difference here is that the SEC seems to take things a bit more seriously
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.400]   than local regulators. Well, in BlockFi's case, they weren't sure whether they needed to register
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.160]   their product as a security, and best I understood, they even sought guidance from regulators but
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.840]   never got a clear answer until they started getting some cease and desist. Fortunately for them,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.400]   they tried their best to play by the rules, and regulators actually let them continue their
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.560]   operations until they could agree on a plan going forward, and this is that plan. I do want to
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.680]   clarify they did also make some misrepresentations about the degree to which their loans were over
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.040]   collateralized, meaning if someone was borrowing against their Bitcoin, how much more Bitcoin did
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   they have than the amount they were borrowing, but given how often financial firms are fined
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.080]   for making these misrepresentations, a hundred million dollars seems quite egregious, and while
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.840]   misrepresenting things is never good, fortunately those misrepresentations never ended up affecting
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.680]   consumer deposits. But one more thing that I think is really fascinating is that despite this ruling
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.280]   from the SEC, one of the four SEC commissioners actually published an interesting letter in
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.520]   dissent on the SEC website that I just want to read a few excerpts from because I think it speaks
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.840]   a lot to the current state of our financial regulations. So this is from Commissioner
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.400]   Hester Pierce, quote, "Lurking behind the legal analysis, however, is an important question.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   Is the approach we're taking with crypto lending the best way to protect crypto lending customers?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.880]   I do not think it is, so I respectfully dissent. As an initial matter, it is difficult to understand
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.280]   how the civil penalty will protect investors. BlockFi will pay the SEC 50 million and will pay
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.320]   another 50 million in connection with state settlements for the same conduct. While penalties
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.240]   this size are intended to deter bad conduct, here there is no allegation that BlockFi failed to
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.520]   pay its customers the money due them or failed to return the crypto lent to it. BlockFi's
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.440]   misrepresentations about over-collateralization are serious, but the combined $100 million penalty
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.240]   nevertheless seems disproportionate." I won't read the entire thing, but it ends with,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.760]   "Working with an earnest desire to reach a prudent, properly calibrated regulatory outcome
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.320]   is important for a number of reasons. First, these products matter to people,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.200]   a program that allows people, and not just affluent people, to keep their crypto assets
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.000]   while still earning a return is valuable to many Americans, as evidenced by the program's
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.200]   popularity in the United States to date. The investor protection objective of today's settlement
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.840]   will be poorly served if retail investors are ultimately shut out from the participation of
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.280]   these products. Second, our process speaks volumes about our integrity as a regulator.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.680]   Inviting people to come in and talk to us, only to drag them through a difficult, lengthy,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.320]   unproductive, and labyrinthine regulatory process casts the commission in a bad light
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.920]   and thus makes us a less effective regulator. Third, a company that tries to do the right thing
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.600]   should be met across the table by a regulator that tries to get a sensible result in a reasonable
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.280]   time frame. For the sake of the American public, our own reputation, and the companies that heed
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.720]   our call to come in and talk to us, we need to do better than we have so far at accommodating
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.600]   innovation through thoughtful use of the exemptive authority Congress gave us." Wow. So respect to
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   Hester for such a bold statement, and to the SEC for allowing her to publish it on the website.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.120]   As for what I'm doing with my BlockFi account, my money is staying put, and I'm excited for the
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:37.680]   launch of the BlockFi Yield account when I can continue adding deposits. Okay, finally, I want
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.880]   to wrap up with a recap and some recommendations from the quick trip Amy and I took down to
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.400]   Oceanside, California last weekend. I'd never even heard of Oceanside, but when I was trying to
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.520]   figure out how to use my $200 hotel credit for my Platinum card, I stumbled upon what looked like a
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.040]   cool hotel called The Seabird, and boy, was I glad I did. So for those of you who don't know,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.160]   Oceanside is about 45 minutes north of San Diego and 45 minutes south of Orange County,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.080]   so you can fly to either and just rent a car or take a lift. It's a small California beach town
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.720]   that was exactly what we needed for a weekend away while my parents were watching our daughter.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.240]   We stayed at The Seabird, and honestly, I couldn't recommend it enough. It's a Hyatt property,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.800]   so you can book it with points. Or it actually wasn't that expensive when we paid in cash,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   well, with a card, you know what I mean. And if you have access to Amex's fine hotels and resorts,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:37.600]   you get free breakfast, $125 hotel credit, late checkout, and a room upgrade. The food was great,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   the pool deck wasn't too crowded, and Amy used that $125 for a massage at the spa that she said
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.520]   was one of the best she's ever had. Honestly, it is such a great hotel, and I am certain we'll be
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:56.320]   back. As for Oceanside, we spent most of the weekend eating, drinking, relaxing, hanging by
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.560]   the pool, and walking on the beach. It was exactly what we needed, and the food was fantastic. If you
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:09.360]   go, definitely check out Craft Coast Brewery for amazing tacos and great beers. Just make sure to
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   get all the tacos Craft Coast style. Also, Carte Blanche for French-inspired Mexican. Their Caesar
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.400]   salad had this chili Caesar dressing that was so good and spicy. And finally, the Switchboard
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.560]   for Hawaiian-Korean fusion and great cocktails. Shout out to my friend and colleague Mark Ryden,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:35.040]   who lives in Oceanside, for all these recommendations. So, to wrap, don't forget
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.800]   that if you want to get in on the Southwest Companion Pass deal, head on over to allthehacks.com/southwest.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.200]   And this episode is another experiment, so please don't expect a two-a-week to be the norm,
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.000]   but if you like hearing this kind of a short recap episode, or if you don't,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.080]   just let me know. You can DM me on Twitter @hutchins, or on Instagram @chrishutchins,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.760]   or just shoot me an email, chris@allthehacks.com. All right, thank you so much for listening.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.240]   See you next week.
