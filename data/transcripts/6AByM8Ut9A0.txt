[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.800]   This episode was hosted by the Metro Boston Bogleheads Chapter and recorded September
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.200]   17th, 2022.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.520]   It features Paul Merriman from the Merriman Financial Education Foundation discussing
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.960]   the 10 most important lessons they have learned over the past decade.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.800]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.840]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   investment advice.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.280]   Okay, it's 12 o'clock so we're going to go ahead and get started.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.640]   I wanted to welcome everyone to the Boston Bogleheads Chapter meeting.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   I'm Therese Reynolds, the Boston Chapter Coordinator, and a few things before we begin today's meeting.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.560]   The presentation will be recorded, including the questions and answers.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.120]   If you don't want to be seen on the recording, you can turn off your video.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.520]   The chat will be saved, but all names will be removed.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.800]   The recording will be saved on the Boglehead Chapter Series on YouTube, and I will also
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.600]   provide a link to the recording when it's available as well as a copy of today's presentation.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.840]   And you'll have an opportunity to ask Paul questions after his presentation.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   Please put your questions in the chat or raise your hand.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.400]   And just a few Zoom tips before we start.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.160]   Please mute yourself during the presentation and stay muted unless you're speaking.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.200]   On a laptop, you can raise and lower your hand by clicking on the reactions button at
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.960]   the bottom of the screen, and then click to raise the hand icon.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.720]   And you can change your name by right-clicking on your photo and then selecting rename.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.320]   And you can keep your video off during the presentation, but if you ask a question at
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   the end, it would be nice to have your video on.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.520]   All right, I'm going to go ahead and start.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.800]   I'm very pleased to welcome Paul Merriman today and a little background on Paul.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.200]   In 1983, Paul founded Merriman Wealth Management.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   After Paul sold his firm and retired in 2012, he established a financial education foundation,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.600]   and the mission of the foundation is Merriman Financial Education Foundation believes knowledge
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.280]   is power and is dedicated to providing comprehensive financial education to investors at all stages
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.040]   of life, with information and tools to make informed decisions in their own best interest
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.960]   and successfully implement the retirement savings program.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.360]   In the 10 years since Paul founded the foundation, he and his team have produced five books,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   and all but one are available at no cost through his website, and more than 700 articles, podcasts,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   and videos.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.160]   His website also includes recommended mutual funds and best in class ETF portfolios at
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.720]   And I've been listening to Paul's podcast for over three years while driving to work
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.240]   each day, and I've learned so much from him about investment strategies and how to invest
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.120]   more money with less risk.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.000]   And I'm also so impressed with the time Paul gives to educate investors of all ages with
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.920]   free information and tools to successfully implement the retirement savings programs.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.400]   And when I contacted him to talk about our group, he not only said yes, but he was so
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.040]   enthusiastic and excited to do it, and we're really lucky to have him here today.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.760]   The Merriman Financial Education Foundation is celebrating their 10-year anniversary this
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.240]   year, so Paul decided to take the opportunity to discuss the 10 most important new lessons
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.380]   they've learned over the past 10 years.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.860]   And again, after Paul's presentation, we'll open it up for questions.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.360]   And I will now turn it over to Paul.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.160]   Thank you, Therese, and thank you for all that you've done to make this possible.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.280]   I am excited.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.000]   I've never made this presentation before, and as I thought about the 10 years that we've
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   been working to help investors, I realized there's probably some things that are unique
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   to our teaching.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.360]   And so I thought I'd focus on the things that have come out of our foundation that we think
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:26.120]   are some of the best work in terms of helping investors understand the process of investing.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   And I do want to get my pointer up here for once in one second.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.320]   You've already read the mission statement, Therese, so let me just add something about
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.640]   our mission and what we're trying to do.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.880]   It's different, I think, from any other organization that I know.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   Yes, I was an investment advisor and worked with many investment advisors to help people
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.640]   do the actual not only the planning but the implementation and the managing of the money.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.300]   And so I had to, we had to learn a lot about investing as a part of that process.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.440]   And my goal is this, I am now here to help do-it-yourself investors do better.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.480]   I mean, that's the goal.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.080]   And that means from my viewpoint that when you are a do-it-yourself investor, it means
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.520]   you need now to be the professional.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.280]   You need to know the information that the people that worked with me needed to know
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.880]   to give advice to others.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.640]   Because in your case, you have one client, theoretically, maybe some kids and relatives,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.780]   but basically you are the advisor to the most important investor on earth.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.400]   And so I want to make sure that you have all of the data, all of the studies.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.640]   And when I say all, I don't mean every study that was ever done, but the information that
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:05.280]   if you were an advisor to others, you would want to have that available to help them.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.800]   So let me speak with you, share with you as a teacher.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.580]   I'm not an investment advisor.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.320]   I don't give anybody individual personal advice except very close friends.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.680]   So I am a teacher and I know this old saying about when the student is ready, the teacher
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   will appear.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.200]   Well, I'm hoping that today for at least a handful of you, there's an opportunity to
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   do some serious teaching here.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.640]   And I thought it would only be fair if I share with you some of the major teachers in my
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   life.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   Dr. Fama and Dr. French from the Dimensional Funds that actually they're academics who
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.760]   were the ones who developed the early research on factor investing, the premium for small,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.700]   the premium for value, the premiums that now people understand commonly in building a portfolio
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:12.340]   to take advantage of not just being in the market, but what part of the market.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.200]   And then of course, I mean, it's not just because I'm here with the Bogleheads I say
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.000]   this, but John Bogle, he was one of the best teachers.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.080]   And yet my class with him was only 90 minutes in his office, but that 90 minutes truly changed
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.760]   my life.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.380]   And then Jason Zweig, he writes for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.160]   I hope if you haven't read Your Money and Your Brain that you will, because it is a
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.400]   wonderful paperback book cost next to nothing, and I think you will learn about why it appears
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.680]   so many people are just a little bit crazy when it comes to money topics.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.080]   And then one of the best in the industry as a teacher is Larry Swedrow.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   I think he's written 15, 16 books, and every one of them is in its own way a classic.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.360]   If you want to be good to yourself, in fact, I reached for this one.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.600]   It's your complete guide to a successful and secure retirement.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.240]   It is just terrific.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.480]   And by the way, I am not a financial planner.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.040]   I am not an estate planner.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.960]   I am not a tax expert.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.880]   I am not a CFP.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.040]   I'm a guy that likes the process of investing.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.920]   And then two other folks, I know you heard of one of them, many of you did, that's Chris
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   Pedersen.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.720]   Chris Pedersen has been an amazing teacher for me.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.640]   He is our Director of Research.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.800]   Daryl Balls is our Director of Analytics.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   You're going to see some of his work today.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:01.720]   He has figured out such clever ways to teach people about how investing really works, and
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.880]   this is not my creation, this is his creation, and Chris has done what he's done.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   They both are working for our foundation without pay.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.960]   And the final person, I suspect nobody there knows her because Atwood happens to be her
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   maiden name.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.720]   Sarah Louise Atwood is my mother, and there are two things she taught me.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.200]   She taught me about the respect for others, and she taught me that it's my responsibility
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.480]   to serve others, and I am so happy she taught me that because without her, I probably would
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.700]   not be here today.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.160]   So I'm going to focus on a handful of lessons.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.680]   These lessons, I think, are some of the most important, and yet not all of them are taught
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.760]   or not taught the way I would like to see them taught, and lesson number one is about
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.720]   the importance of an extra one half of one percent.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:11.400]   People throw returns around, and they oftentimes don't realize that just small changes in what
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.320]   we do with the portfolio could lead to little additional returns, and pretty soon, you've
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.080]   got an extra half of one percent, and what does an extra half of one percent potentially
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.040]   lead to?
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   Early retirement for some, having more to spend in retirement for some, leaving more
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.880]   to others at the end of your life.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:40.360]   In my case, my IRA all goes to the foundation at my passing, and so to the extent that I
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:47.380]   can, I want that to be as big as it possibly can to be there to help others, but for every
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.440]   extra half of one percent, I can make the case that whether you're a first-time investor
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.080]   or you're a first-time retiree, it can be a million-dollar payoff.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.540]   Let me just show you quickly.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.960]   Let's just assume we have two investors.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.040]   One of those investors, and I want to get my pointer here for me if I can, just one
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   second please.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.640]   Well, I guess I'm not going to get my pointer right now, but one of these investors makes
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:24.080]   8% during the accumulation period, and then in retirement makes 6%, and from that 6%,
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.440]   they take 4% each year to live on.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   The second investor makes an extra half of one percent.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:38.200]   Now, I'm sure you have lots of ideas how one might make more money, but if there is an
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.840]   extra half a percent, that means 8.5% during the accumulation period and 6.5% during the
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   distribution period.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.200]   We make the assumption that $5,000 a year was invested, and they started at age 21,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:00.880]   and they retired 46 years later, and they lived in retirement to enjoy the money to
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.600]   live on.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200]   What is the long-term impact on that?
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.880]   Well, first of all, there was an investment in both cases of $230,000.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.240]   In the case of the first person, at retirement, they had about $2.3 million.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.020]   They took withdrawals of 4%, and by the way, that means a little money is there to build
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:32.740]   and become of greater value in the future, but they took withdrawals of about $3.5 million.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.280]   They left $3.8 million.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.340]   From my viewpoint, when people ask me how I've done with my investments, I'm not going
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:47.820]   to really know how I did until I die, because at that point, they could figure out how much
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.120]   did he take out to live on and how much did he leave to others, and that is the real return
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:02.320]   on that $230,000, which if you add those two together, totals over $7 million, but the
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   person who figured out a way to earn an extra half a 1%, instead of having $7.4 million,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.280]   they have $9.6 million.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:23.640]   They have $2.3 million more because some way, somehow, they found an extra half of 1%.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.440]   And so when we wrote the book, We're Talking Millions, Rich Buck and I, 12 Simple Ways
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:38.520]   to Supercharge Your Retirement, it was really about looking for those one half of 1% opportunities,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.880]   and they're legitimate, which in theory, if there are 12 of them, and in every case we
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.200]   can figure out a way when you come to a fork in the road to do better with one fork than
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   the other, you could in each case have an extra million dollars.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.840]   And by the way, I'm hoping that you will take the free copy of the book.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.160]   I am hoping you will not go to Amazon and pay for the book.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.960]   I am hoping you will take the free audio that you can get, and the reason I want you to
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.200]   get it free is because my hope is you will pass it on to family members.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.680]   All you have to do is send them the link, and they're in.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.280]   And my goal, my goal is if I can last 10 more years with this foundation, that we're going
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.040]   to get a million books out to people.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.880]   Now, you all can get a copy of the book, it'll take you a couple of hours to read theoretically,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.920]   but I can give you in just a few minutes what you're going to learn.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.240]   Where can you get an extra 0.5%?
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   And it turns out that the first one, choosing stocks over bonds for the long term, bonds
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:54.280]   compound at around five or less historically, stocks 10 and more as a group, depending what
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.800]   group you look at, you'll see that in a second, there is a 5% difference right there.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:09.720]   If in fact a 0.5% will add a million, think what 10 0.5% or 5% would mean over a lifetime.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.240]   It's huge.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   And yet a lot of young people refuse to go into the stock market because it's so risky.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.040]   And choosing mutual funds over individual stocks, young investors think they're going
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.660]   to make the most money if they get on some hot horse and ride it.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.000]   And yet every study I've seen says the probabilities over time are going to be greater with a diversified
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   portfolio than a non-diversified portfolio.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.880]   And what do Bogle heads know above all?
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.440]   That lower expenses are likely to lead to higher returns.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.920]   That is true.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.720]   That is absolutely true.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.880]   That doesn't mean because you could get a bond fund with 1/10 of 1% fee compared to
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.680]   a stock fund of 2/10 of 1% that you should be in the bond fund, no.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.040]   First it's the asset class, then it is the expense.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.840]   There's no question based on what we know at Morningstar that an extra half a percent
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.560]   is just sitting there for a lot of people who are in mutual funds that are charging
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.140]   one even more than 1%.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:19.520]   One thing a lot of people don't know is that when you're in a taxable account, Morningstar
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.880]   actually keeps track of the tax efficiency of funds.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   Some funds have very high tax efficiency.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.600]   Some funds have very low tax efficiency.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.680]   When you look at the difference between index and actively managed funds and you look at
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:46.540]   the after tax return, there's typically about 1% lost to taxes in an actively managed fund.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.840]   And so that is just one more advantage for the index fund over actively managed.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:59.120]   And of course, we want young people to take advantage of tax favored accounts.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   I'm going to be talking in a few minutes about a young investor, 17 years of age, who is
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.640]   making that choice to do tax favored investing.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.260]   And I think you're going to love the outcome, potential outcome, and maybe find someone
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:22.760]   in your family to do the similar thing, adding small cap and value asset classes to a portfolio.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.160]   Another way historically of adding a half a percent or more.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:35.520]   Now these decisions here are not exactly about getting something that you can compare so
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.760]   easily, but I can tell you that choosing saving over spending is one of the biggest decisions
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   we make.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.100]   Warren Buffett says, don't say what's left over after spending, spend what's left over
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.340]   after saving, pay yourself first and start it early.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:58.220]   This 17 year old young lady who started at 17 instead of waiting until she's got a full
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.220]   time job.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.020]   It's going to make a huge difference.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.180]   In fact, most people who see this today are not going to believe it.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.040]   And then choosing buy and hold over market timing.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.200]   Almost everybody says, oh, don't market time.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Market timing doesn't work.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.480]   You hear that all the time.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.500]   Yet what do most people do?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.900]   Yeah, most people do market timing.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.040]   If they think interest rates are going up, they want to get out of bonds.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.600]   If they think international is going to be better than U.S., they want to get out of
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.460]   U.S. and have it in international.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.380]   They want to move things around.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.000]   That all has to do with market timing.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.760]   Now you can do it technically, mechanically, or you can think it all out, but it doesn't
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.560]   change the fact that you're taking steps to try to perform better.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:54.000]   All of the evidence is it does not help.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.840]   Lesson number two.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   I think this is huge.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.520]   How to compare equity asset class returns.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.460]   There's not enough information as far as I'm concerned.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.320]   But what Darrell Balls has done to help us, first, he gives us this information.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.800]   This is pretty simple information, but it's a good start about equity returns.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.720]   Here's the S&P 500 large cap lend here in the first column.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.000]   They call them as large cap value, small cap lend, then small cap value.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:37.360]   And over the last 94 years, those returns ranged from 10.2 up to 13.4%.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.320]   Looking for a half a percent?
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.280]   Sounds like there's some in there.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.760]   But these are very, very high-risk investments on a short-term basis.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.280]   This is what scares so many young people away.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.120]   I might lose a lot of money.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.720]   You will lose a lot of money.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.960]   We just don't know when.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.680]   But we know looking backwards that the best year that the S&P 500 ever had was up 54%.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.040]   The worst calendar year was down 43.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:13.560]   And each of these asset classes, you can see there, and here's, by the way, the gold ring
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.880]   of asset classes is U.S. small cap value.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.720]   Because that compound rate of return is about 3% more than the S&P 500.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.200]   That's a lot.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:35.400]   And the risks on the downside are not that much higher when you think about the potential
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   return.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.520]   Now, I'm just going to give you a little taste right here.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:45.040]   But notice to the far right, we have these combinations of these four different asset
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.160]   classes.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.960]   And if you put 25% in each of those four, the compound rate of return over the last
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.240]   94 years has been 11.9%.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.440]   And the returns against on the upside and the downside, well, on the upside, they're
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.440]   much better.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.200]   On the downside, they're not that much worse.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.160]   More on that later.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.640]   When we go out, and this is the lesson young people need to understand, when we go out
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.160]   and look at 15-year periods, all of a sudden, you're not looking at a plus 50 and a minus
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.440]   40.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:26.960]   You're looking at the best 15-year compound rate of return was 18.9 with the S&P 500.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.720]   And the worst was a break, a little better than break even.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.000]   And the other ones were not that different, by the way.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.680]   Large cap value was a little loss.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.840]   Small cap blend was a better profit, 1.6% a year.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.320]   Small cap value, a loss of 1.9%.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.020]   Now, that's 1.9% for 15 years.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.520]   So that's not a small loss, but that's the compound rate of return.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.080]   And here again, we have these combinations of asset classes.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   Look over here.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   I love this.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   I just love it.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.840]   Here's the strategy, half in S&P 500, half in small cap value.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.440]   Compound rate of return, the best was 21.6%.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:18.560]   The worst was virtually the same as the worst for the S&P 500.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.520]   But the best information is the longer term information, because that difference between
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.360]   the best and the worst continues to shrink.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.640]   That's an important thing for young investors in particular to understand, that your risk
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.840]   in reality goes down a lot.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.280]   And the best 40-year return was a gain of 12.5%.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.360]   The worst was a gain of 8.9%.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.480]   So the worst 40 years was still profitable.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.280]   And by the way, if you inflation adjust those returns for those periods, there was only
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.640]   about a 1% difference.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.740]   So these are nominal returns without adjustment for inflation.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:07.440]   And notice the average 40-year return of the S&P 500 happens to be the return of the last
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.760]   52 years, 11%.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.360]   Small cap value was 16.2% average.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.480]   That didn't, the last 52 years didn't produce 16, but it produced about 14.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.800]   And large cap value and small cap blend are in between.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:36.960]   And again, when you look at these combinations, you go from 11 with the S&P 500 to 13.7 with
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.840]   the combination of the four asset classes.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.920]   And look, the worst 40 years was 10.8, about 2% better than the worst 40 years for the
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.560]   S&P 500.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   I'm thinking that that four fund strategy is worth at least taking a look and finding
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.720]   out more about that risk in return.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.200]   Now here's, and I mentioned this before, short-term returns are random.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.680]   They're all over the place.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.880]   Now when you ask people, well, what do you think the market will do next year?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   Invariably, most people will say, ah, probably up about 10%.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.440]   Why do they say that?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.600]   Because that's the compound rate of return basically for the long-term.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.520]   But the reality is it's going to be all over the place.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:31.880]   And I want some way, some tool, some information that would help me and help others understand
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.880]   that randomness.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   And here it is, Daryl Balls, our director of analytics built this table.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.960]   I just love this table because I can look at this from 30,000 feet.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.720]   I realized that these different colors, green is the S&P 500.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.600]   The kind of yellowish tan is the large cap value.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.400]   The reddish color is small cap blend.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.120]   The electric blue is small cap value.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.160]   And then we have that four fund combo that's purple.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.640]   But when I look just at the green, because green is what I know, the S&P 500.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:18.320]   By the way, I also know that the S&P 500, that that expected return is lower because
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.720]   it's of higher quality.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.880]   And if it is lower because it's of higher quality, that means that it's probably not
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.320]   going to be number one very often.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   Well, it is number one often, regardless of what the long-term return is.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   But we never know when.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.120]   I mean, there was a period here from 1940 to 1945, where it's green every year at the
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.640]   bottom for six years.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:53.000]   But then if we fast forward to 2014 here through 2019, in all but one year, it was at the top
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   of the pile.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.880]   And of course, anytime it's at the top of the pile, people say it's the only place to
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   be.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   They say small cap value is dead.The premium for small cap value is no longer available
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.240]   because the S&P 500 recently has been doing well.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.280]   That is one of the biggest traps.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   It makes you believe that there is something, a trend that is going to last longer than
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.840]   it is likely to last.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:29.480]   So I just want to use this to show how this stuff just moves around from year to year.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:35.360]   And those who think they're going to market time or find some sort of a pattern here--
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.240]   and I'll talk about the pattern that I get here that just knocks my socks off.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.720]   But as far as a pattern to know where you should be, green, blue, brown, red, whatever,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.600]   it isn't here.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.000]   Asset classes drive returns, lesson four.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.120]   If you look at all those years, you will see, if you look at one year at a time, that it
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.760]   is the asset classes that make you or lose you money, not the stock picking, not the
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   market timing.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.280]   And let me just take you through four years, just four years of that quilt chart that Darryl
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.840]   put together.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:28.720]   '97, small cap value up 39%, large cap value up 38.4%.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:36.480]   Hey, looks to me like it was a year that value was kind of king of the hill or queen of the
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.240]   hill because it was the two value funds sitting at the top there of performance.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.800]   Down here at the bottom, these were not horrible years.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.840]   But remember, when you see the S&P 500, I want you to think growth.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.160]   It is not a value index.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.960]   Yes, it has some value in it, but it is cap weighted, and those returns are driven by
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.100]   the most growth-oriented companies.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.200]   And the same is true with small cap land.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.620]   You've got the power of small growth.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.160]   So that was not the place to be.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.800]   And by the way, when I say that, understand, there's no risk in the past.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.760]   I always know what we, and we always know what we should have done.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.680]   And all we have to do is look at the past and see what we should have done.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.040]   Well, in 1997, we should have been in value.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   But what good did that do us for '98?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.600]   Because in '98, it wasn't small.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   It wasn't value or growth that drove the positive returns.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:45.800]   It was large, large blend, and large value that created the positive returns.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.560]   Now true, yes, large growth did better than large value.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:56.400]   But notice, the small cap indexes actually lost money.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.120]   So if you looked at the list of the best performing funds for 1998, guess what?
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.440]   They are going to be large cap kind of growth-oriented funds.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.480]   The worst performers are going to be in the small cap.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.880]   And yet these people who were in the large cap growth or blend, they'd like to think
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.040]   that they were reason that they were so good was because they picked the right stocks.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.920]   No, they were in the right asset class.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:34.840]   1999, all of a sudden, it looks like growth was the winner because small cap blend and
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.880]   large cap blend, never driven by growth mostly, did well compared to the value.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   Yeah, value was up, but about a third of what the growth was up.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.760]   And finally, in our fourth year, here we see it again, values leading the pack.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:30:01.000]   In fact, small cap value up 20.5 and the S&P 500 down 9.1.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.320]   And you could ask yourself, are they in the same market?
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.960]   How can that be?
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:14.680]   But if you look back at that 1928 to 2019 quilt chart that Darrell put together,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.400]   you will see that is not an unusual outcome.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.120]   In fact, between the S&P 500 and the small cap value,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.080]   the average difference in return per year is about 15%.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:40.560]   Lesson number five, diversification of asset classes is a million dollar decision.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:46.120]   See, a lot of people have told, all you really need is the total market index.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.840]   All you really need, Warren Buffett says, is the S&P 500.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:59.400]   Because those are really good companies and they drive a good long-term return.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.040]   But they totally ignore the idea of diversification.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.640]   Well, they'll say, of course, there's diversification in the S&P 500.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.680]   There's 500 companies.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.480]   But they are 500 companies that are basically in the same asset class.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:23.240]   And sometimes those asset classes fall apart for long periods of time.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.480]   But I want you to see the impact of diversification.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.000]   And you can say that I am optimizing or data mining.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.960]   And I don't think I am at all.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.760]   Because I'm looking at this whole 1928 to 2019 period.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.480]   And I'm seeing the green and the blue and all these colors all over the place.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:56.280]   But when I look at the diversified portfolio of all four of those asset classes,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.160]   I see a lower risk investment.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.120]   I see a strategy that is likely to help me stay the course when there are times
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.920]   that people want to bail out of other investments.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.640]   And I'll show that to you in a few minutes with the S&P 500 from 2000 to 2009.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.720]   You'll see it in action.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.040]   It fell apart.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   Well, yeah, it fell apart after it was up over 17% for 25 years from 1975 to '99.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.560]   So it's not like it's a miracle that it was out of sorts and out of favor
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.960]   for the decade of 2000 through 2009.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.560]   But a diversified portfolio of asset classes, what's the key?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:54.080]   Lesson number six.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.760]   Now, I've already given it to you.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.080]   But I'm going to add something to it.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.040]   It's a little uncomfortable.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.200]   But there's no question from looking backwards.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.720]   If you want to use the past as any indication of the future,
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.800]   that small cap value is the best of these major asset classes for the long term.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.720]   And the academics would say, well, it's easy to understand why.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.240]   Because you get the market return in it.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.120]   You get the small cap premium in it.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   And you get the value premium all wrapped up in one.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.480]   You don't get the value premium in the S&P 500 in the same way.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:39.600]   You don't get the small cap premium in the S&P 500.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.040]   Let's just look.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.800]   Instead of one year at a time, let's look at 10 years.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:51.120]   Look at the decades from 1930 to '39, 1940 to '49, '50 to '59, et cetera.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.840]   And we can see in each decade, which of these asset classes--
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.000]   by the way, in this particular study, Daryl
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.720]   was kind enough to add fixed income so you could get an idea that,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.640]   for young people who think that fixed income is a good thing to do,
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.880]   that for the long term, it probably is not.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.360]   And these are nominal returns.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.400]   Again, Daryl's always there to make that difference, not inflation adjusted.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.200]   Look at their small cap value at the top.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:28.800]   By significant amounts, by the way, in five of the nine decades.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.560]   But there are a couple of decades the S&P 500 was at the top.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.840]   There was also a decade that it was at the bottom.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.640]   Another decade it was at second from the bottom.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.800]   In fact, T-bills from 1970 to 1979 had a better compound rate
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.080]   of return than the S&P 500.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:58.840]   And over the whole period, small cap value, 13.7, S&P 500, 9.8.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.920]   1930 through 2019.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:09.160]   But I want you to notice again about that four fund strategy.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.360]   I think this is important.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.840]   The four fund combo outperformed significantly
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.920]   in many of the decades, the S&P 500.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:30.440]   I'm here at 1949, 1949, 14.3 for the four funds versus 9.2.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.280]   1960 to '69, 11.3 versus 7.8.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.480]   '70 to '79, 10.6 versus 5.9.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.680]   Yes, in 1990 to '99, it was number one.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   And in 2010 through 2019, it was number one.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.480]   But look where four fund combo is.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.920]   It was just right in there, just almost, not quite the same,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.120]   but almost the same.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.760]   So when somebody says, put all your money
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.160]   in the total market index, put all your money in the S&P 500,
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.520]   I just want you to see there are other things you
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.480]   might do if the future looks like the past.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.120]   And when you do it, you are increasing
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   your diversification, not only with more companies,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   but with more asset classes.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:28.080]   And then Darrell did something.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.960]   This is just a part of the entire study,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.840]   but it's kind of the bottom line.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.760]   And I love this study, too, because it tells us,
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.040]   in a way, what we might expect, depending
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.160]   on how radical a position that we take.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.080]   It turns out, if we take the position that the S&P 500 is
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:55.920]   a place to be, that in 36 of these years,
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.680]   that you would be in the top 20%.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:08.280]   And in 48 of the years, you'd be in the bottom 20%.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.120]   Interestingly enough, with very few in the center.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.280]   At the other end of the spectrum is the small cap value,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.760]   45 times number 1, 31 times number 5.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.360]   As opposed to what?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:31.880]   As opposed to a portfolio that's all value, small and large.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.600]   You didn't get 13.4, but you got 12.5.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.440]   That's pretty doggone good.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.880]   Or the two fund strategy, the S&P 500
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:47.040]   with small cap value, 12.2, 2% better.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.800]   There, you were never in the top quintile.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.160]   You were never in the bottom.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.960]   You were always somewhere in the middle.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.160]   And then the four fund strategy.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.840]   Made a little less, 12% instead of 10.2.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.640]   Again, rarely at the top or the bottom.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.880]   And then finally, the S&P 500.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.920]   Now, I'm rooting for people.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.760]   I get paid nothing to do the work that I'm doing.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.880]   In fact, I'm the one that has written most of the checks
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.800]   to keep this process going.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.520]   I am trying to change the financial future.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.560]   So many of you, you're in your 40s, your 50s, and your 60s.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.680]   And you're going to say, well, that's interesting,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.280]   I've already got a portfolio that I
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.920]   know enough about that I don't need to improve mine.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.880]   But I am hoping that you'll suggest to your kids
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.240]   that maybe this is a better idea than what you've been doing.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.960]   Maybe.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.080]   And by the way, this is not me with a big know-it-all head.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.040]   In fact, just the opposite.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.440]   I can't know it all.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.840]   In fact, I know what people want to know.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   I've been in the business.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.920]   I was in it from 1983 until 2012.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.160]   People, the most asked question is,
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.240]   what do you think the market's going to do?
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.040]   And if I answer, how the hell should I know?
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.920]   They say, well, I don't want to do business with you.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.960]   I want to do business with people who know
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.760]   what the market's going to do.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.520]   Well, most Vogel heads and most members of the AAII,
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.560]   where I've been teaching since 1983 or '84,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.680]   they know better.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.960]   But we're all longing for someone to know.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.600]   I think what you can know.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.720]   You can know kind of how the volatility is--
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.160]   what it's going to look like.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.400]   Not when is it going to be up 20 and down 20.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.200]   But what should I expect in terms of down years and up
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.280]   years?
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.880]   And how long may a bad period go?
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.680]   There are a lot of questions that
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.640]   can get answered from looking at the past.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.040]   That's the part of the past I want you to know.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.160]   But it was the academics who noted the small cap
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.280]   and the value factor, premium.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.600]   And you can choose to say, there is no premium for small cap.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.120]   There is no premium for value.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.640]   Or you could say, by the way, you
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.360]   could because nobody knows.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:23.240]   There also is no premium for stocks over bonds.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:29.440]   Well, in fact, since the year 2000, that's been largely true.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.680]   Yeah, I mentioned earlier for 25 years,
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.120]   the market was up over 17% a year.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.720]   But since it was up over 17% a year for 25 years, since 2000,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.320]   the compound rate of return is less than 7 and 1/2%
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.000]   for the S&P 500.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.760]   Is it reasonable to conclude that the premiums
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.600]   that we've known in the past from equities are gone?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.080]   Nobody knows.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.120]   I don't think so.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:05.320]   Lesson 7, why most people who try small cap value
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.880]   will be disappointed.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.480]   There are people who should never touch small cap value
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.320]   because the moment that they're going to want to touch it
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.040]   is when it's red hot.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.840]   And that's when we get burned, right?
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   Let me show it to you.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.200]   This is thanks to Darrell Balls again.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.080]   This is called a telltale chart.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.760]   To the best of our knowledge, the first telltale chart
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.360]   was developed or was displayed by John Bogle.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.520]   But we don't know that for a fact.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   But here's what it shows.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.840]   And it's magic in the story it tells.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.000]   It compares the relative growth of two asset classes
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.720]   in this particular case, small cap value and the S&P 500.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.800]   When the line is going down, when the graph is going down,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.400]   it doesn't mean that they're losing money.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:10.200]   It means that the relative growth for the S&P 500
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.920]   is better than that for small cap value.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.360]   When the lines are going up, it means small cap value
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.400]   has better relative growth.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.240]   Now, if all I want to see is the bottom line,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.640]   I go to the far right over here, and I look at this 14 number,
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.720]   and it says, basically, if you put money into small cap value
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.840]   back in 1927, you would end the period
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.520]   with 14 times more money in small cap value
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.080]   than you had in the S&P 500.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.240]   Oh, well, I want some of that, of course.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:54.720]   But you have to understand that for about 17 years and six
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.200]   months from the beginning time in 1927
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   until sometime in the '40s, you would have been better off
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.240]   to be in large cap blend in the S&P 500.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   But small cap value finally caught up and did better,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.520]   only to move sideways for another 19 years.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.040]   Then it spurred up again for a very short period of time,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.120]   and then it moved sideways for 7 years, 11 months.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.160]   Then another spurt, and another sideways for 17 years.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.480]   Then another spurt, then another sideways for over 16 years.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.240]   And what do you think?
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.880]   When do you think that investors are
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.520]   going to be most interested in adding small cap
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.120]   value to their portfolio?
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.040]   You see, this is why I want you to think like an advisor.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.480]   I want you to know what an advisor knows
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.000]   about these numbers.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.840]   Because when you get tempted by the emotion of investing,
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.080]   you see, that's why people theoretically
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.960]   come out ahead with a professional investment
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.400]   advisor, financial planner, than doing it themselves.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.240]   Because they're supposed to be objective, one.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.280]   And two, they're supposed to be educated.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.240]   And this is the information they're
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.920]   supposed to know, that they can say to you, wait a minute.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.880]   I just want you to realize, you're
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.720]   wanting to add an asset class that
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.440]   has been making tons of money at a time
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.360]   that maybe it's not going to make
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.160]   tons of money for many years.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.680]   By the way, for those very long periods where it moves sideways,
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.760]   at the end of that period, it means basically
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.640]   that the S&P 500 and small cap value ended at the same place.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.880]   Thank you, Darrell Balz.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:04.280]   Lesson number eight.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.760]   Few funds, a couple of funds, three funds, four funds,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:16.080]   maybe five funds, can be just as profitable as having 10 funds
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.640]   and without taking any more risk.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.160]   Now, this was a lesson that changed my life.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.400]   Because I was out there telling people about the strategy
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.960]   that I was using for my clients, not
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.320]   thinking about the implications of people
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.800]   being a do-it-yourself investor.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.320]   So here was the pitch I used to make.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.200]   And we updated this table every year.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.080]   The pitch I used to make was, you put $100,000
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   into the S&P 500 in 1970.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.040]   How would you have done if you just let it be?
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.280]   You didn't add any money, you didn't take any money out
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.080]   without paying any taxes, and 11% compound rate of return
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.680]   grew to $23 million.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.840]   $100,000 to $23 million, that's all you need to know.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.640]   But if I made one very small step, a baby step,
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:16.080]   and I added large cap value as an asset class for 10%
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.560]   of the portfolio, the return goes up from 11 to 11.2.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.920]   And you may be saying, well, so what?
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.120]   I mean, that's not all that much.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.920]   Yes, it is.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.400]   The $23 million goes to $25 million.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.920]   And then when you add 10% small cap blend,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.000]   and it goes up 1/10 of 1% more, it
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.800]   adds over another about $1.7 million.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.240]   And then you add small cap value,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:48.000]   and it goes up about $5 million.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.680]   And by the time you've added REITs
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.840]   and the international asset classes, big, small, value,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:59.840]   et cetera, and then you add also emerging markets.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.120]   You have gone from an 11% compound rate of return
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:13.160]   to a 12.6, and you're more diversified.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.000]   You're a little more volatile, but most of that volatility,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.280]   as you're going to see, is on the upside,
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.200]   not on the downside.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.160]   But I tried to take this 10 fund strategy
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.080]   and shove it down the throat of do-it-yourself investors.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.400]   And that's when I got the what for from John Bogle
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.960]   when I spent 90 minutes with him in 2017 in his office.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.800]   He was the best teacher in that 90 minutes I ever had.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.560]   He not only changed my life--
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.480]   and by the way, Chris Pedersen was
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.760]   trying to get me to do the same thing--
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.160]   but he changed the life of a lot of people
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.800]   who were now willing to do something
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.760]   more than the total market or the S&P 500.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.520]   Maybe not with much, maybe just with a little,
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   but give themselves an opportunity
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.040]   to make a better rate of return.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.760]   Another lesson on this page, by the way,
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.960]   I want you to look down here.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.880]   Notice instead of 12.6, this particular same--
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.680]   by the way, same asset class.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.840]   3/10 of 1% less.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.480]   Instead of 47.7 million, you end up with 42.6 million.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.720]   The difference is the portfolio was rebalanced
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.600]   on a monthly basis instead of an annual basis.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.280]   The top one is annual, the lower one is monthly.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.120]   But it's less risky because you keep
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.840]   taking money away from the more risky asset classes that
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.640]   are producing the higher returns.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.160]   Daryl is working on a wonderful study right now.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.680]   The implications of rebalancing every couple of years,
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.120]   every three years, every five years.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.920]   I think you'll like it.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.880]   So out of this came, between John Bogle's motivation
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.320]   and Chris's willingness, along with Daryl Ball's to work hard
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:18.360]   to help us see what these small portfolios, what they could do.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   We developed all these different portfolios.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.320]   And now what we need to do is to be
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.360]   able to show people how with a few funds,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.400]   we're still getting access to value.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.840]   We're still getting access to small.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.960]   We're not ignoring it.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.080]   We're not ignoring it.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.680]   We're still getting access to small.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.480]   We're not ignoring those things that we
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.600]   want in that portfolio.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.200]   And once again, Daryl Ball's hits a home run.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.280]   I'm not kidding.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.760]   The first time I saw this table, and I love tables of numbers,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.560]   and saw what Daryl did in trying to help people,
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.680]   to educate people, I was just blown away
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.920]   I now understood risk from a whole new way.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.640]   Here's what he did.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.160]   He took each one of these portfolios, the S&P 500,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   the 10 Fund Strategy, the 4 Fund Worldwide, the 4 Fund US,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:22.520]   the 5 Fund Worldwide All-Value, the 2 Fund All-Value US,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.120]   the Worldwide 2 Fund Small Cap Value.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.720]   That could actually be three.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:33.360]   And the combination of the US large blend and small value.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.960]   And there's one more here.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.560]   No, there's the all small cap value.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:45.000]   And the last one here is the US 2 Fund, half S&P 500,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.280]   half small cap value.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.440]   And here's what he did.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.280]   He created, and he sent this to me with these boxes,
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.880]   because he knew it would help me.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.040]   And I hope it helps you.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.760]   Because one way to look at return
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.960]   is to break this down over some periods of time that
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.720]   would be meaningful to see how different they might be
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.680]   for what we'll call a relatively short period of time.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.520]   In this particular case, he looked at 10 year periods.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.560]   He looked at the S&P 500, looked at the whole period
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.480]   from 70 to 21, got an 11% compound rate of return.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.440]   But he looked at 70 to 79, and 80 to 89, and 90 to 99,
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:29.640]   2009, and 2010 to '21, just to catch what we had.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.960]   And the first thing that just stood right out to me
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.120]   was not only the difference between 11
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:43.160]   and these other compound rates of return, but 70 to 79.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.720]   Here is this problem of owning one asset class.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.760]   It wasn't good during that period.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:58.240]   And yet the worldwide all value, or the US four fund strategy,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.080]   or the worldwide all small cap value,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.160]   they were clear winners during a period of time
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.120]   that people thought it was the end of the stock market,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.280]   literally.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.920]   The end of equities was the front cover of US news
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.560]   and world report.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.960]   But-- and by the way, the same thing
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.120]   happened in 2000 through 2009.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.440]   The S&P 500 had a terrible 10 year period.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.040]   But everybody else, all these other combinations,
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.440]   because they were other asset classes, in many cases,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   along with the S&P 500.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.960]   So I thought the blue area was really
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.320]   helpful in understanding the kind of randomness of this,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.360]   how different these different strategies might perform.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.040]   I thought maybe people might start thinking about, well,
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.600]   maybe I'll have some of the four fund US
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.160]   and the worldwide all value.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.720]   I mean, I didn't know how people might use this information.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.440]   But then Darrell did a second thing.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.600]   He looked at only the up years.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.440]   So he looked at the S&P 500 and each of the other,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.600]   and he looked at how many years--
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.840]   pardon me, were they up?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.840]   They were up in 42 years out of the 52.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.880]   And the average gain was 18.7%.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.120]   That's an important number.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:37.080]   The sum of all of those years was 787% when they made money.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.440]   And the best year was up 37.5%.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.080]   Now I can look at other strategies.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   And the first thing I noticed is in every case, in every case,
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.680]   the averages were much, much higher.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.720]   Well, I guess we should have because the returns were higher.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:05.960]   But in some cases by a lot.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   But that tells us about the good times.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.000]   And nobody has any trouble with the good times.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.200]   In fact, I would bet that if somebody owned the S&P 500
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.360]   and they were up 18.7% a year, average on those 42 up years,
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.240]   they would be pleased as punch.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.400]   OK?
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.240]   But it's the down years that causes
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.640]   people to leave the industry, to give up on their investing,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.480]   which is that reason I'm so pro four fund strategy,
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.880]   to try to protect from things getting too far out of whack.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.080]   Well, here's what we know.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.480]   If you looked at all of the down years,
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.360]   you would see the sum of all of the 10 down years with the S&P
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.280]   500 was 141%.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.880]   Well, that's a nice relationship.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.920]   10 losing years, 141%.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.440]   42 profitable years, 787.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.280]   The gains are 18.7.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.960]   The losses are 14.1.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.000]   You know, I've got a feeling for that asset
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.480]   class and that strategy.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.440]   On the other hand, just for fun, go all the way
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.920]   to the right side of the page and you'll see the number
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.320]   of up years, 41.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.720]   For the two fund strategy that is half S&P 500
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:38.000]   and half small cap value, total sum of the bad years,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:46.200]   130% versus 141 for the S&P 500.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.240]   Whoa.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.760]   I mean, the part I don't like is losing money.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:57.040]   And that tells me that it is not unreasonable to believe
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.240]   that the losses that I will sustain in the future
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.360]   will be similar, whether I am in the two fund strategy or the S&P
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:11.800]   500 alone, but one gets 11% and the other gets 12.7,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.560]   at least during this period of time.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:20.360]   And here's the other part that we should understand.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.840]   If the down years are about the same,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.080]   but if the standard deviation for that two fund strategy
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:33.280]   is higher than the standard deviation for the S&P 500,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.840]   people are thinking, oh, it's more risky.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.000]   Well, in a sense, it was more volatile,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   but it was more volatile in the good years.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.520]   It was the good years that made the difference
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:52.200]   in that standard deviation, not the bad years.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.760]   I love this work, Daryl.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.280]   Thank you.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   I know I'm running out of time.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.480]   I'm going to keep going here.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.400]   I'm going to make this one real short.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:08.040]   Lesson number nine, the bogo heads in Boston
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.720]   already heard from Chris Pedersen.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.840]   He developed a strategy called Two Funds for Life.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.560]   It is one of the most clever strategies I have ever seen.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.400]   What he did was he combined a target date fund, a fund that
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.600]   changes its asset class, its mix as you get older.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.560]   It starts adding more fixed income to the portfolio
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.560]   as you would expect a pension fund who
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.600]   was taking care of your pension payout
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.160]   would get more conservative as you get older.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.120]   But he adds a little something that just isn't there
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.600]   in that target date fund.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.520]   He adds small cap value, and he's
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.080]   got a couple of ways to add it.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.200]   One is you just put 10%.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.640]   Let's say you're investing 10% of your money.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.160]   9% goes into the target date fund.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.200]   1% goes into the small cap value.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:07.160]   And over a period of investing, you
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:14.200]   will probably pick up an extra 1/2% return over time.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.920]   And if you put in 20% instead of 10,
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.800]   you even make more from everything
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.200]   we know about the past.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.440]   And you would be making a weak fund stronger.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.200]   I love target date funds.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.480]   I am not being critical of them.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.600]   But for reasons of not wanting to deal with questions
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.080]   from investors-- why is this in there?
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.320]   It didn't do well last year.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.520]   They don't put small cap value into the fund
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.960]   for any significant amount.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:54.080]   And by the way, Chris then came up with another super idea.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.400]   And that is for people who are young and more aggressive--
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.520]   and by the way, the last half of We're Talking Millions
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:10.960]   is dedicated to this particular strategy in a really basic way.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.240]   In Chris's book, Two Funds for Life,
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.760]   he digs in like a good engineer would
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.480]   and really tears the strategy apart
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.240]   for people who are really interested.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.400]   It's a wonderful book.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   It's the only one of our books that aren't free.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.440]   But I can tell you that every book that's
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.240]   sold at Amazon, the royalties all go to the foundation.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.040]   Chris does not get a cent.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.440]   You multiply your age times 1.5.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.160]   You're 30.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.040]   That'd be 45.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:43.000]   45% goes into the target date fund.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.680]   55% goes into small cap value.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.040]   As you get closer and closer to age 60 and 65,
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   you are in the process of eliminating the small cap
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.200]   value.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.720]   And if you really want to spend the time,
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.880]   go watch his presentation to Bogleheads, the Boston chapter
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.360]   that was done earlier this year.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:12.440]   And in, I think, the chat notes, you all have access to a PDF.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.200]   So if you want to capture these links, all you have to do
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.440]   is download that PDF, and it will give you
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.640]   all the links I'm going to mention as we go along.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.840]   How much in stocks and bonds?
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.800]   Huge.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.400]   This is a huge decision.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.480]   I want you to be all in stocks when you're 20 and 30.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.000]   I want you to be all in stocks probably to your 40
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.360]   and then start cooling your jets a little bit.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240]   But here's what we provide.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.760]   And I know this looks like a lot of numbers,
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.000]   but that's what an investment advisor wants to see.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.120]   They learn from these numbers.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.920]   And by the way, the numbers are way better than the graph
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.440]   because the graph hides a lot of stuff
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.520]   that you can see when you see the numbers.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.440]   But we have fine tuning tables for every one
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.040]   of our strategies, equity strategies, combinations
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.360]   of those different equity asset classes.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.440]   And on the right-hand side of this table
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.560]   is the 100% equity portfolio.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.880]   So you can look year by year from 1970 to 2021
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.800]   and see how the S&P 500 did.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.920]   And we loaded it with a minimal expense
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.960]   that you would pay today.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.800]   On the far left-hand side is 100% bonds.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.800]   And as you move to the right from the left,
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.840]   every time you move one line, you are adding 10% equities.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.280]   So those of you who are afraid of equities,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.720]   I want you to see the bottom of this page.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.640]   This is where the learning is really good, I think.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.840]   I want you to notice 100% bonds over that 52-year period
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.640]   had a 7.1% compound rate of return.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.720]   That's probably too high, isn't it, today?
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.000]   By a lot.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.040]   Maybe not for long.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.480]   We don't know.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.720]   I want you to see what happens.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.280]   Every time you add 10% in stocks, the return goes up.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.600]   Half of 1%, half of 1%, 4/10 of 1%, 5/10 of 1%, 4/10,
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.080]   3/10, et cetera.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.680]   And every time you add more equities,
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.440]   not only does the return go up, but so does the risk.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.760]   So my wife and I, we are not in the S&P 500.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.600]   We're in the 10-fund strategy.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.920]   But with the S&P 500, if you have a 50/50 stock bond
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.960]   portfolio, you've got to be ready to lose
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.320]   23% of your money in a year.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:56.280]   Well, I mean, you do if you think the past is relevant.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.000]   And I love to be able to show these negative numbers to go
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.800]   along with the positive numbers.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.040]   You see, when you get a sales pitch and not a real advisor,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.840]   you'll be learning about the upside.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.120]   You will not be learning about the downside.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.600]   And I want you to prepare--
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.400]   hope for the best, of course, but prepare for the worst.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.600]   Make sure-- in some cases, it makes sense for people
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.560]   to take less risk and save more money.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.080]   Because if they take too much risk,
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.840]   they're going to throw in the towel.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.560]   And then where are they?
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.880]   And I have-- like I said, I've got these same tables.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.800]   Daryl puts them together.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.960]   This table's for the US 4-fund portfolio.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.160]   You can see the exact same relationship
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.360]   between return and risk, except that as you
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.200]   move across the table, you're picking up more than 5/10 of 1%
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.760]   because the underlining strategy had a higher compound
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.400]   rate of return.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:06.040]   11, young investors.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.200]   Please share this with them.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:14.080]   Another one of Daryl's goodies.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.600]   I told him I wanted to figure out a way to help young people
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.320]   understand what it's like to put a little bit of money in
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.040]   and keep adding some money.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.360]   And he came back with this, and I love it.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.320]   We take the strategy.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.120]   We do the skin with all the different strategies.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.720]   Some of them, by the way, are 50/50 US international.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.040]   Some of them are 70/30.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.280]   We look at it from every direction or many directions.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.200]   Here's what happened.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.600]   You put away $1,000, $83.33 a month.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.480]   At the end of the first year, after taking
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.720]   the risk of the stock market, you had $1,022.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.840]   In other words, you put in $1,000 of your money,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.360]   and all you got was $22 in profit.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.480]   And you could say, what is going on here?
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.840]   I did this to make money.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.360]   Well, when you see the rest of the table
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.080]   and you understand what patience--
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.720]   and maybe these tables help build patience.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.360]   And that is always what an advisor is trying to do,
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.600]   is to build patience with the investor.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.840]   Notice what it looks like at the end of 10 years, $16,000.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.440]   At the end of the next 10 years, almost $120,000.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.600]   At the end of the next 10 years, almost $700,000
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:48.480]   after 30 years of putting away from $1,000 to $2,300.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.880]   And then the worst thing happened for the next 10 years.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.760]   Remember, this is the S&P 500 only.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.000]   No asset class diversification.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.240]   The next 10 years ends with $662,853.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.560]   You lost money overall.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.280]   But what if?
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.360]   What if instead you had the US four fund strategy?
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.000]   Remember, it's a big, small value, growth, et cetera.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.120]   Where were you at the end of 30 years?
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.280]   Well, you were a little over $700,000 at $783,000.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.000]   Maybe not as much over as you thought you would be.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.840]   But at the end of the next 10 years, instead of losing money,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.120]   you had $1,282,000.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.840]   And at the end, if you look at the whole 52-year period,
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.240]   the S&P category, all equities, $3.7 million in value
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.480]   versus almost $6 million in value.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.280]   Little things mean so much.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.880]   And then there's the distributions.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.400]   We have over 100 tables devoted to looking at different ways
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.560]   to distribute money.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.600]   I know it's overkill, but we're trying
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.280]   to make sure we have information that will help
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.920]   as many investors as we can.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.440]   Fixed means you start with an amount of money.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.600]   Let's say on $1 million, you start with $40,000.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.400]   You take that out.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.880]   There's that old 4%.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:35.440]   And then you adjust for inflation each year.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.120]   Flexible means that you totally ignore inflation.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.640]   You just take out 4% a year or 5% a year.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.400]   That's what my wife and I do.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.240]   We ignore inflation because we over-save.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.960]   We don't have to worry about inflation.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.200]   That, I think, is one of the greatest financial luxuries
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.080]   we have, is to have over-saved when we retire,
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:02.200]   because we don't have to worry about inflation so much.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.400]   But with the flexible, you take out 4%,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.360]   whatever the portfolio was worth the end of the previous year.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   The market goes up.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.680]   You get 4% the following year of a higher number.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.320]   If it goes down, you get 4% of a lower number.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.280]   And here it is, the S&P 500 on a fixed basis.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.560]   Again, you see all of these columns
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.720]   because it is replicating the fine-tuning tables,
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.000]   putting the fine-tuning tables to work.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:43.320]   And we can see how bad it got with a 100% stock portfolio.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.760]   You got down all the way to $718,000 from a million
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.800]   at the end of 1974.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.120]   Ah, but if you had fixed income, you got down 50/50.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.720]   That's what my wife and I had.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.760]   You got down to 956.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.760]   It still wasn't pretty, but it wasn't 718.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.720]   That's why we have fixed income in there
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.720]   is to protect against those kind of periods.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.320]   But I can look at the bottom, oh, I can go out 30 years.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.560]   The 50/50 ended up with 5.4 million.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.080]   The 100% stock, 6.3 million.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.360]   But you went through hell to get there.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.840]   Here it is if you made one small change, exactly
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.480]   the same investments.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.200]   But instead of taking out $40,000,
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.280]   you take out $50,000.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.720]   You run out of money.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.640]   Now, you won't probably let yourself run out of money.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.840]   You'll simply reduce your lifestyle.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.200]   And instead of taking $50,000, you'll be taking less.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.520]   Maybe moving in with your kids.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.720]   Then there's the flexible.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.960]   As I say, we have over 100 tables
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.560]   to support you in this arena.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.640]   And here we look, for example, this is the 5% a year.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.360]   Remember?
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.680]   Starting with $50,000, you ran out of money.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.480]   Notice every column goes to the bottom.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.280]   Why?
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.480]   Because there was an adjustment downward after a bad year,
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.360]   not an adjustment upward.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.720]   Makes a difference.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.000]   Lesson 13, I'm almost done.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.120]   This is for young people.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.240]   You want to do something special.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.640]   You want to do something for one year of a kid's life, just one.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.320]   I want you to do something that means
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.680]   you will be able to give that child for one
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.600]   year of their life a million dollars.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.640]   What I want you to do is I want you to put, please,
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.840]   I want you to put $365 into an account in small cap value.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.000]   And I want you to hold that in your name
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.600]   until that child is earning some money where
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.720]   you can take whatever that $365 is
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.080]   and you put it into a Roth IRA.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.120]   And through that whole period, you're in small cap value.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.680]   And from that point for the rest of that child's life,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.200]   I want that money to be in small cap value.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:22.600]   And if small cap value for 70 years compounds at 12%,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   that is over a million dollars.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.720]   Now, Daryl would say, but yeah, what after inflation?
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.560]   OK, about $100,000.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.760]   Now, just for one year, do something like that for them.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.480]   And then if you feel like it, the next year
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.360]   you put in $365 for when they're 71.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.560]   And then the next year for when they're 72.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.320]   You get it?
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:54.400]   Now, by the way, a $3,000 upfront payment
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.000]   will get you a huge amount of money
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   in terms of funding a Roth IRA to turn
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.360]   into tens of millions of dollars.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.480]   I will be funding this for my new grandchild.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.200]   Every one of my grandkids gets a little pot of money
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.960]   to grow for them for the future.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.240]   But then I want to talk about this first five
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.560]   years of a Roth IRA.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.880]   This could be for when that little kid grows up.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.920]   But the bottom line is that if you
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.000]   are able to early in a child's life put away the $6,000,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.840]   and in this particular case I'm going to tell you about,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.040]   it's a real case.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.720]   It just started in the last months.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.400]   But I believe, as much as anything
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.040]   I believe about the future, that this young lady is
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.200]   going to do what she says she's going to do,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.680]   because she's been working and earning money.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.720]   And she's going to put away $6,000 a year
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.920]   into a Roth IRA.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.680]   Now, she is getting some help from grandma and grandpa
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.320]   and mom and dad for college.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.480]   OK?
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.080]   So they're actually very proud that she's doing this.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:13.240]   She is going to put the $6,000 a year for five years.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.000]   And then she's going to stop that Roth IRA.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.520]   And she is going to let it go in small cap value.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.680]   And if she does that, and she does it until she is 65,
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.720]   and then she takes out 4%, and she continues
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.480]   to own that small cap value, I mean, after the five years,
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.000]   she can go ahead and do whatever conservative things she wants.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.560]   I want her to own this package of companies.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.880]   It's not like they're a bunch of losers.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.440]   It's not by-- it's a bunch of bums.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.480]   These are little companies that are all--
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:59.280]   they are, let's say, $3 billion in size on average right now.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.560]   So what I'm saying is, is that if this works
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.200]   and the 12% is achieved, she will have in that account
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.720]   $5.3 million at retirement.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.920]   She will take withdrawals from age 65 to 95 of $22 million.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.600]   And she takes a 4% annual withdrawal.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.680]   And she will have $46 million left over for her heirs.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.880]   All right, your child cannot afford $6,000.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.160]   If they could afford $600, you just simply divide it by 10.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.120]   It's still a huge amount of money.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.920]   And a great lesson with patience.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:46.200]   And it's not unusual for people to believe in putting money
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.840]   aside and living it forever.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.440]   People do that all the time in corporations
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.160]   that they like for the long term.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.920]   I like this asset class for the long term.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.920]   If it's too late for you to do it at 17, do it at 20.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.880]   Do it at 25.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.360]   Do it at 30.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.720]   Darrell took it over all these periods, what you would have
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.840]   at the end, including the legacy amount from when
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   you could get started.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:20.520]   We have a lifetime investment calculator
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.360]   that I hope every one of you will give a shot.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.960]   It is wonderful.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.320]   It allows you to do all of these things
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.120]   I'm talking about that I talked about today,
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.000]   except to do it with your own numbers.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.640]   And there's one other thing it does that I just love.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.320]   Let's say you thought the numbers I'm showing just
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.720]   don't seem reasonable for the future,
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.600]   but you like the idea that all the volatility is there.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.040]   And yeah, life is probably going to be something like that.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.920]   Or maybe I should start in 1973 and see how it works out,
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.600]   or 1990 and see how it works out.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.160]   All of those things can be done.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.680]   But it allows you to go in and say, take a half of 1% off
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.560]   of all the returns to the table.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.400]   Take a percent off.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.280]   Make the assumption I want to hire an advisor
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.640]   and pay them 1%.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.120]   Take 1% off the top and see how I'll do.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:24.520]   This is all that stuff.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.960]   As a matter of fact, Therese went
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.640]   through all of this in the introduction,
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.680]   so I'm not going to do anything except.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.400]   I want to mention one thing of what I think
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.440]   is of great importance.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.520]   It's the last one.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.560]   We have a best advice link on our site.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.440]   When you go there, that's on our home page, when you go there,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.840]   you're going to see a dropdown with a bunch of topics.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.080]   These are topics I talked about today.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.520]   I did not talk at any length.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.320]   Or in fact, I didn't talk about the portfolios,
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.120]   the recommendations that we make for investors
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.520]   and our best in class ETFs.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.600]   I don't think I touched on that.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.040]   But if you go to any of these links,
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.320]   you're going to get an article about the fine-tuning tables,
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.320]   you're going to get a podcast about the fine-tuning tables,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.400]   and you're going to get the updated fine-tuning tables
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.160]   through the end of the previous year.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.400]   Every year, we go in and update all this work
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.320]   with a new podcast, with a new article,
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.200]   in the hopes that it will get you up to date in the work
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.080]   that we're doing.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.200]   And what can you do for us?
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.800]   Easy, share our information with others.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.560]   Leave comments and kudos on social media.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.920]   You all know how to do it, whether it's
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.880]   YouTube or a podcast.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.080]   We need that help.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.920]   And give us feedback.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.880]   I am more than happy to find out that--
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.360]   I'm happy when you tell me you like what we're doing,
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.800]   but I'm also happy when you tell me what you
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.720]   would like us to do more of.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.680]   And we are a 501(c)(3) foundation,
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:08.480]   and we do use the donations that are given to us.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.920]   About a third of the money that we spend each year
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.960]   comes from outside donations.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.720]   The other money comes from inside.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   And there's my email.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.640]   I'm available.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.480]   I'm not available to be an advisor.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.920]   I'm available to answer generic questions,
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:32.240]   and most of the answers will go into a podcast or a newsletter
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.640]   or a video.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.720]   And every once in a while, I pick up the phone
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.240]   and call somebody because I'm confused.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.400]   So I appreciate it when you leave a phone number.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.000]   Again, I do not give personal advice, but I know how to nudge.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.760]   All right, Therese.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.480]   Thank you.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.880]   I'm going to stop sharing.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:01.920]   And open this up, if we might, for questions.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.440]   OK.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.560]   Thanks so much, Paul.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.720]   Just having you go through all those tables
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.280]   is really helpful because it's a lot of information.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.840]   I know they can all be found on your website,
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.320]   but it can be overwhelming.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.600]   So I think it's helpful to go through that, especially
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.840]   for young investors, some really good information.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.480]   I know that my two sons are actually on this Zoom call,
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.000]   so hopefully they're learning a lot.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.120]   That's great.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.560]   We do have a few questions that have come to me
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.480]   either through email or I've gotten some of them
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.720]   out of the chat.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.720]   So I'm going to start--
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.640]   I'll just start with the first one here.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.360]   I've been listening to Paul's podcast
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.680]   and am interested in his for-fund approach
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.480]   to investing in equities.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.680]   I currently have my Roth and Vanguard's Total Stock Market
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.560]   Index, VTSAX, for simplicity.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.160]   My questions are, one, does VTSAX
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.560]   approximate the for-fund approach?
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.160]   And two, which would have provided the best returns
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.640]   in historical analysis?
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.320]   Well, the Total Market Index is going
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.880]   to give about the same return as the S&P 500.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.920]   They tracked it all the way back to 1928.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.880]   And there is a 1/10 of 1% a year advantage to the S&P 500
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.600]   in those long studies.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.800]   So what that really says is, even though the Total Market
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:28.760]   Index does give people some exposure to small-cap value
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.600]   and to some large-cap value and mid-cap holdings
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:36.640]   that the S&P 500 does not, because these things
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.440]   are cap-weighted and are driven by the growth
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.480]   part of the portfolio, that's not enough small-cap value.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.160]   That's not enough small-cap land.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.240]   That's not enough large-cap value to move the needle.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:54.760]   So what happens is, by moving the needle
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.400]   and putting 25% each into each of those four asset classes,
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.800]   you move the needle over 1.5% a year in terms of return.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.000]   Now, that's from the past.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.480]   And we don't know what we should expect out of the future.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.920]   But the academics tell us that they expect there
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.480]   will be a small-cap premium.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.040]   They expect there will be a value premium.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.920]   What they don't know is by how much.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:30.600]   We know that for the period of 1928 to 2021,
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:39.920]   the average 40-year premium was 16% return for a 16%
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.400]   for small-cap value versus 11%.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.160]   That's a 5% difference.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.680]   But over the last 40, 50 years, it's
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.400]   been about a 3% difference.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.120]   So the return of the four-fund strategy
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.920]   should be somewhere between 1% and 2%
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.920]   better rate of return than the total market
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.520]   index or the S&P 500, and at virtually no more risk.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.440]   I mean, if you go back to that quilt chart that
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.920]   showed that the four-fund kind of goes along the middle,
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.840]   and the green one, the S&P 500, or total market,
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.440]   is up at the edges, the top and the bottom,
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.680]   I'm thinking the four-fund strategy
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.360]   is a lot less volatile one year at a time.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.840]   One day at a time, that's a different matter.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.960]   But one year, I would pick the four-fund
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:38.360]   over that big S&P 500 or total market, either one of them.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   OK, thanks.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.360]   We have a question that was in the chat.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.160]   Paul, do you know of any target date funds
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.920]   which incorporate the four-fund concept in their equity
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:51.760]   portion?
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.640]   As much as I'd like to do it yourself,
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.240]   investing equities to bonds as I age,
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.000]   I prefer the automated set-it-and-forget-it
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.480]   solution which target date funds provide.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.520]   Yeah, unfortunately, no.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.640]   That is not available.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.280]   And there's a good reason.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.920]   And this came up in the conversation with John Bogle
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.000]   when I was there in 2017, because I've
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.840]   been very outspoken about the target date funds at Vanguard.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.200]   Because why would you put 10% of a portfolio of a 21-year-old
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.680]   in bonds?
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.600]   And all you have to do is look at those fine-tuning tables.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.840]   Every 10% of equities or bonds is
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.720]   going to reduce your return by a half of 1%.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.720]   Well, we don't want to cost a 21-year-old a half of 1%
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.120]   because of a 10% bond position.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.720]   How much of a bear market is that going to protect?
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.920]   And should you even be protecting a 21-year-old
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.120]   against a bear market?
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.840]   You should be encouraging them to take advantage
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.920]   of the bear market.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.080]   It's old people like me that don't want the bear market.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.640]   So the fact is-- and what Bogle said
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.120]   was these have to be created to make them
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.600]   acceptable to all investors.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.960]   So we have to do things that make it highly likely
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.600]   that they will stay the course.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.280]   We want them to understand that bonds
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.800]   are a part of this portfolio over a long period of time.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.120]   And we're going to start with just a little bit,
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.840]   and then we're going to grow from there.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.960]   But that little bit is costing the investors.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.480]   And they also don't want to load up on smaller value
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.360]   because all of a sudden, the portfolio
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.720]   is going to look different than the S&P 500
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.880]   or the total market index.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.240]   And any time you start looking different than the index
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.280]   that people rely on, see on TV, hear on the radio,
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.960]   then they start saying, what's wrong with my portfolio?
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.480]   Why am I making less?
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.760]   Oh, it's that small cap value.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   What idiot put that small cap value in the portfolio?
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.280]   So what they do is they solve the problem.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:12.400]   They don't expose the investor to what the investor really
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.000]   should have.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.920]   And they understand that, by the way.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.040]   But they're doing it for the sake of the investor
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:24.280]   because they are trying to make it very easy for people
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.320]   to stay the course.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.360]   Thank you.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.200]   Krista, do you want to ask your question?
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.680]   Thanks, Paul, for all of the great info.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.200]   One thing--
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.400]   Nice to see you.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.200]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.080]   One thing that I wanted to circle back on
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.920]   was, how do you approach the international funds
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.360]   in the four-fund approach?
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.080]   Are you saying just stick in US?
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.400]   Or where does international factor in?
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.040]   Oh, no, that's a great question.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.920]   I went to the US because I wanted
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.160]   to compare it to the S&P 500 and keep it US.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.720]   That made it kind of work for me for today.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.440]   No, I absolutely believe in international.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.560]   We have the same portfolios built
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.960]   with 30% in the international equity portion and some in 50%.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.360]   I happen to personally use 50%.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.000]   But the difference between 50% international and 30%
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.080]   international is almost nothing.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.400]   It's amazing how close they come over a long period of time.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.880]   When you-- and I didn't spend any time on this.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.720]   So Chris Pedersen has done an analysis
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.200]   of the universe of ETFs.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.040]   So in every asset class that we have,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.360]   he has picked what he considers to be the best
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.440]   ETF in that asset class.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.720]   He doesn't mean the one that's going to be the best
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.680]   performer in the next year.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.240]   He wants to find the best small cap value that
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.480]   over the long term is likely to do better
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.640]   because it has the right amount of value, deeply discounted.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.360]   It's the right size company inside of the fund.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.000]   The expenses are low.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.240]   The turnover is low.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.560]   There are all these things that he looks at.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.720]   The profitability of the companies are a consideration.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.600]   So when you go to our website and you go to portfolios,
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.000]   you can drill down to ETFs.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.720]   Then you can drill down to best in class.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.280]   And there you will see the recommendations
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.600]   that Chris has made.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.600]   Now, he updates those periodically.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.200]   So he will probably, in the next year, make a few changes.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.480]   But he doesn't make them all the time,
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:50.160]   even if he found an ETF that he would like to.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.480]   It's just too confusing if you move around very much.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.120]   And by the way, tax inefficient if you're
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.760]   in a taxable account.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.840]   But yes, as a matter of fact, you would see--
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:09.160]   let me just think about the worldwide four fund strategy
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:16.240]   has the same asset classes as the four fund US portfolio.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.080]   Well, how can that be?
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:25.480]   Well, in the worldwide, the first fund is the S&P 500.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.320]   That's large blend.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.360]   The second fund is large cap value,
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.480]   but we use an international large cap value.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.480]   That's the second fund.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.560]   And the third fund, small cap blend,
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.960]   is a international small cap blend.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.400]   And then small cap value is US.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.440]   So you still have the small cap value, and the blend,
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.360]   and the big value, and blend big.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.920]   But you have them balanced between US and international.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.440]   And the returns come out almost the same.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.360]   You can see it on that page that I included of how they did.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.960]   So you can get almost the same return.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.320]   The key is having the exposure to value,
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.040]   having the exposure to small.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:15.560]   And we're doing all that we can to make it easy.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.400]   Thanks, Paul.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:19.960]   Oh, I did.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.040]   I should mention, too.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.760]   This is important.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.320]   You can go to Vanguard and get all of these recommended ETFs
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.560]   commission free.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.160]   Now, you've got to enter it online.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.080]   You can't call up.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.120]   But if you do it online, whether you're
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.960]   at Fidelity or Vanguard, you can do it commission free.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:42.960]   OK.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.040]   Awesome.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.560]   Because we are at Bogleheads here,
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.280]   Chris has also made the recommendations
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.120]   with the corresponding Vanguard ETFs.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:56.080]   If you are stuck emotionally on owning Vanguard,
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.280]   we're doing all we can to help you.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.920]   But it's about a 1% lower compound rate of return
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.480]   than using the best in class.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:11.280]   Miriam, do you have a question?
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.360]   Yes.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.600]   Hi, Paul.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.200]   Thank you for your presentation.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.600]   It was very interesting.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.760]   Thank you.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.960]   I have a question about small cap value.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.320]   The small cap value is a fund--
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:33.720]   they're funds made up of small companies, value companies.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:37.360]   And what is it about those companies
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.760]   and small cap value funds--
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.120]   what is it about those companies that gives a premium?
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.720]   What do those companies do that gives the premium?
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.160]   And what happens when they are out of small cap value,
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.360]   when they grow too much and they're out of it?
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:00.240]   Well, that small cap premium, according to the academics,
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:06.160]   is simply the premium for small over large.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.840]   Small companies are more risky.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   So if they didn't pay a premium, then
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.240]   nobody would ever invest in small companies.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.280]   Because why would you take the risk?
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.680]   I mean, there is historically a higher rate of return.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.720]   And it comes at higher volatility.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.080]   So it's not a freebie.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.440]   You're being paid for taking the risk of small.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.200]   Value is another premium, whether it's
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.720]   large value or small value.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.480]   Value is defined by a number of ways,
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.080]   but according to the academics, the book value
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.120]   versus the market value.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.040]   If the book market is relatively high--
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.440]   that's the book value, the net value,
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.600]   asset value of the company--
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:57.160]   if it's relatively high versus the market price,
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.040]   or if the P/E ratio is low versus the market price,
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.880]   that would typically be value.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.760]   Growth companies might sell for twice the P/E ratio,
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.840]   twice the book to market.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.720]   People are willing to pay a lot of money for those companies
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.120]   because they have an amazing future.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.880]   That's the good news.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.160]   But when growth companies fail, they fail miserably,
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.280]   and people can lose huge amounts of money.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.200]   In fact, sometimes you've probably
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.280]   seen it after the close.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.600]   A company comes out with disappointing earnings.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:40.320]   They miss it by a penny, and the company drops by 25%.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.440]   That's because people had huge hopes for that company.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.360]   And you could look at companies like Amazon.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.840]   People are counting on Amazon to become many, many times
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.760]   bigger than it is right now because it's
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.800]   priced with the idea that it's going to.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.880]   There's going to be a return.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:01.040]   Well, with value companies, people don't see that return,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.320]   so they're not willing to pay much.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.840]   And what the academics tell us--
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.120]   don't buy value companies one at a time.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.480]   Because if you took 100 value companies that
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.640]   were out of favor, they're out of favor for some reason.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:21.000]   Selling for a low P/E, selling for a high book to market.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.920]   Out of 100, five years later, 50 of them are still dogs.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.240]   The other 50 have done something special
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.040]   that turned those companies around,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.920]   changed the view of investors, started making money
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.520]   when they weren't.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.840]   And so it's the half that do that bring the premium up
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.800]   because there's the other half that don't, that are still
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.440]   keeping the premium down.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.240]   But overall, there has been a premium, historically,
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.280]   for taking the risk of investing in dogs.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:00.880]   And when Warren Buffett, who's a value investor,
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.960]   it isn't that he won't get into a company that
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.280]   becomes a fast-growing company.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.600]   But when he gets into it, it's typically
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.000]   when it's not a fast-growing company.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.480]   When it sells for a fair price.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.320]   And it's interesting because these small-cap value,
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.760]   like the 17-year-old young lady who
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.600]   is going to put that money in small-cap value,
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.560]   she probably won't know the name of any of those 500
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:33.200]   to 1,000 companies.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.880]   They're not household names.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.200]   And at some point, you brought up the point,
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.960]   they're going to become growth.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.840]   And they're going to move out of the value portfolio
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.240]   into a portfolio that is some other index.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:55.560]   So could you define value for us who--
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.440]   It could be a low price-to-earnings ratio.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.240]   It could have to do with cash flow per share.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.800]   It could have to do with the book value versus the market.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:15.080]   There are many ways that professionals identify value.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.480]   From my viewpoint, when we recommend an Avantis fund,
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.760]   and we recommend several of their funds,
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.040]   they are probably--
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.520]   this is one of the finest fund families
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.200]   for what we're looking for, for the people who follow our work.
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:36.480]   We know step-by-step what they do, and how they buy,
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.160]   and how they sell, and at least as much
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:43.240]   as they're willing to share that isn't truly proprietary.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:48.280]   So at that point, we say, obviously, you do it.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.000]   Dimensional funds may do it different from Avantis.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.600]   And there are other small-cap value funds.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.880]   Vanguard, if you read Chris Patterson's article
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.040]   about how he chooses ETFs that fill each one of these
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.320]   brackets, he explains what he's looking for.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.440]   But for example, at Vanguard, I think it's VBR.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.600]   The average size company is about $6 billion,
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.160]   as opposed to the fund that we use, that we recommend,
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.520]   is about $3 billion.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.640]   It's smaller.
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.760]   It's more deeply discounted.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:36.320]   And so-- and they overlay the size and the value
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.520]   with a profitability factor.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.960]   That's something else that might be there.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.920]   Now, are we expecting the people who
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:50.800]   follow our work to become experts on factor investing?
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.680]   Probably not.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.520]   But if they read Larry Suedro, they can kind of become one.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.800]   He does a great job of digging into the ETFs.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.560]   And what we're hoping--
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.360]   when I say that I'm trying to turn the do-it-yourself
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:15.120]   investor to help them have the same knowledge an advisor has,
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.960]   an advisor needs to understand the risk and the return.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.320]   They need to be prepared for all the things that naturally
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.040]   happen in a portfolio, where the individual investor says,
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.960]   what the hell is going on here?
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.040]   I don't understand.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.080]   Well, you should understand, because you
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.320]   should have seen the past gains and losses
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.000]   and noticed that things, for different reasons, go down.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.920]   But they seem to go down very similarly.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:49.240]   And that's the part of investing that we can know the history.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.080]   Nobody, professional or amateur, can know the future.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.080]   Nobody.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.240]   And anybody who talks like they know the future
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.920]   is just blowing smoke.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.640]   It is nothing more than telling people
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.560]   what they think you want to hear as an investor,
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.120]   so they can sell you something.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.120]   Thank you.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:12.720]   You're welcome.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.800]   Thank you, Miriam.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.920]   OK, we have another question from the chat.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.720]   Is there an advantage to a four-fund strategy
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.880]   if you're retired and maybe have a 15-year horizon?
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.160]   Ah, funny he should mention 15.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.360]   I'm 78.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.040]   I'm thinking in terms of a 15-year horizon.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.640]   Well, I'll tell you what I know.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:40.400]   I know that if I look at that table that I used early on
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.360]   and I looked at 15-year periods, and there
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.040]   were ranges of what the good times looked like
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.720]   and the bad times looked like.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.400]   And so I have to ask myself when I
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.600]   look at some of the money that's in our portfolio,
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.400]   are we investing for ourselves or are we investing
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.000]   for children and charities?
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.640]   And in large part, we're OK if we just sat on fixed income.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.720]   If we just took the half of the money that's in fixed income
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:13.160]   and put it aside, we could live on that.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.280]   The other money is really for others.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.120]   And so I look at the 15-year numbers
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.400]   in that table that showed the S&P 500
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.520]   and shows the four-fund strategy.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:31.320]   It was that first of the equity returns from 1928 to 2021.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.360]   What you'll see is the four-fund strategy
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.600]   had virtually the same worst 15 years as the S&P 500,
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.520]   but the returns were better in the good times.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.480]   So yes, I would, if I had 15 years,
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.800]   take the risk with money I don't need to live on.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.920]   But if they decided they want to put the S&P 500 in,
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.400]   when you go back to that quilt chart,
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:08.360]   the four-fund strategy is more dependable than the S&P 500
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:11.920]   because it has many asset classes.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.200]   The S&P 500 would likely be the worst of the four asset
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.000]   classes.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.240]   The four asset classes together are
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:26.320]   likely to be better than the S&P 500 on its own.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.960]   But we have to also remember, we all
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.680]   want the best of the next 15 years for ourselves.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.000]   We want the near future to be good.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.760]   This 17-year-old young lady that I talked to,
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.840]   and I've got her set up with her first $6,000 small cap value
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.840]   investment, I told her, for the first five years,
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.200]   it will feel so good if it looks like '95 through '99
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.160]   because '95 through '99, small cap value
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.360]   compounded at over 20% a year.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.440]   Yeah, yes.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:16.760]   Or on the other hand, it could look like 1970 through '74.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.840]   Which is better for her, a terrible five years
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.640]   or a great five years?
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.400]   Well, the great five years sounds
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.360]   like that would be better.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.880]   But the terrible five years means the first $30,000
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:35.080]   is buying stuff cheap that later is supposed to be worth more.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.920]   If it isn't, then we've missed on the whole thing.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.360]   So that's a part of what being a real professional advisor
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.800]   is, to understand what is this part of a portfolio for?
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.120]   I have part of our portfolio in a hedge fund
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.160]   that I helped start in 1995.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.720]   It is not for me.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:05.280]   And it is built to use leverage plus market timing.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.880]   I mean, two things that people don't want to do.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.440]   But I happened to help start it.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.920]   And I happen to know the people that run it.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.480]   And I trust it as much as I trust anybody trying
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.520]   to manage money for people.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.280]   But it's a part of my portfolio.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.960]   It's 10% of my portfolio, less than 10% now.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.920]   And so that's where it becomes important to decide,
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.440]   where does it make sense to take more risk?
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.240]   I tried.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.880]   When I was an advisor, I would try
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.200]   to get old people to invest more aggressively
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.480]   with the part of the money that they really felt was for others.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.960]   But a lot of them would say, well, I'm not sure.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.880]   I don't need it now.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.400]   But I might need it later.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.880]   All right, let's compromise.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.120]   How about if we use more of a balanced approach
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.280]   than you would do for a young person,
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:03.000]   but more risk than you might, knowing that it's not
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.760]   likely to be used in your life?
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.320]   This is the magic, I think, of being a good advisor.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.840]   And that is why, when I think about an individual being
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.720]   their own advisor, how much of this stuff do they know?
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.760]   What is it that we can help teach them that if they wanted
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.360]   to, they could literally go out and be an advisor someday?
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.840]   Because you know the ropes.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.720]   You know what to expect, because you know history.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:39.800]   OK, thanks, Paul.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.360]   Let's go ahead and let Brian ask his question.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.600]   He has his hand raised.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.240]   OK.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:46.840]   Hi, Paul.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.600]   I love your work.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.640]   We're talking millions.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.280]   I thought it was absolutely fabulous.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.400]   And I'm doing what you recommended
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:58.320]   by putting about 20% of the small cap value in the Roth IRA.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.680]   And if it's not for me, it will be for the next generation.
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.600]   And I think that's absolutely terrific.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.640]   I'm using-- and you also mentioned FISVX, the small cap
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.240]   value index fund of Fidelity.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.320]   You have that.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:16.840]   But my question is, as I noticed in your best in class
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:21.360]   portfolios, you have IJS, which is the iShares version.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.040]   But that follows the S&P 600.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.560]   So when you look at your quilt charts and all
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.840]   of the terrific work you and the guys are doing, what is--
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.680]   am I better off in the FISVX, which is following the Russell
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.480]   2000 value index, or do I want to be more in the S&P 600,
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.240]   following the S&P 600 value index, or a mixture of both?
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.720]   Well, I will tell you that from everything
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.880]   I know about the work that Chris does,
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.800]   at the beginning of this presentation,
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.440]   I talked about my teachers.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.160]   There may be people who don't believe
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.400]   that I look at the people that are working with me
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:04.720]   as my teachers.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.880]   But they are truly teachers that have helped me understand
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:13.520]   this whole process better.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.800]   I'm embarrassed to say that I am basically a salesperson trying
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.920]   to help.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.360]   I am not the technician.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.360]   I am not the person figuring this all out.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.400]   I am a teacher.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.600]   And teachers aren't necessarily the ones that do stuff.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.080]   They teach stuff.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.960]   Chris does stuff.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.720]   And when he digs into those best in class, I trust when I--
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.360]   because every time I go through why, why, why, why,
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.200]   and he explains patiently.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.040]   You've seen Chris present.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:48.000]   I think Chris is one of the finest presenters.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.200]   He's so calm.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.080]   He's so patient.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.600]   I would, if I had the choice, I'd
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.880]   be taking his recommendations.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:02.600]   And you have them available to you at the Fidelity,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.240]   or you have them available at Vanguard.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:11.200]   Now, the fact that we've also done portfolios for Fidelity
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.000]   and Vanguard is only because there
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.840]   are all the people that have these.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.240]   That's what they have available.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.080]   So we've tried to give some help.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.120]   And that may be your case, is that you just
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.520]   don't have all these different ETFs available to you
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.640]   where you're investing.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.480]   Is that the case?
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:35.200]   For me personally, well, my 401(k),
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.400]   it's limited to just total market index funds.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.120]   But yeah, so obviously my Roth IRA,
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.920]   which has all the options through Fidelity,
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.280]   I guess I could purchase the Advantis.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:51.920]   And I guess your options are obviously much more open when
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.320]   you're with Fidelity or Vanguard than just the general 401(k)s.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.680]   Yeah, and let me make it ever so clear.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:07.080]   There is not one thing we do that is done to benefit us.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.920]   Now, when I say that, I'm sure there is something
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.280]   we do to benefit us.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.800]   Well, from time to time, we ask for money.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.880]   From time to time, we get people to get the books
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.200]   and pass them on.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.800]   But the bottom line is, Chris is doing everything he knows
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.920]   and continues to work with the people
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.400]   from these different companies like DFA,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.600]   like Advantis to understand exactly what they're doing
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.560]   or as exact as they will let us see.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.560]   Now, I love DFA and what they've tried to do for investors.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.680]   And the people at Advantis or Avantis,
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.440]   however you're supposed to say it, they're out of DFA.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.440]   They're almost all of them out of DFA.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.400]   And these are the people who have built portfolios
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.280]   with the work of Dr. Fama and Dr. French and others like them.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.720]   There are more doing it today than just those two guys.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.280]   So Chris is learning.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.240]   And when I sit and start listening
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.440]   to Chris and these guys talk, I realize
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.080]   I'd rather be someplace else because they're really
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.080]   getting into the weeds.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.200]   He cannot sit and get into the weeds
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.000]   with all that stuff with the people who follow our work.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.760]   I don't know that it's appropriate
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.000]   because we'll start appealing to the wrong people.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.880]   We really are trying--
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.640]   it's not that we don't want to help everybody.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:40.480]   But we are trying to help the people that
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:47.520]   need to understand the basics of investing and returns and risk.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.080]   And I will tell you, very few investment advisors
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.520]   understand what's in the weeds.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.000]   You try to get somebody who tries to sell you
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.040]   an indexed annuity to actually explain an indexed annuity
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.680]   or read the contract and then ask them, what does this mean?
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.760]   They don't have a clue.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.880]   They do understand how an indexed annuity works.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.480]   And they can sell them rightly or wrongly.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:23.600]   But when I say we're trying to develop the knowledge
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.000]   of an investment advisor, I'm not
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000]   talking about a person who works in the research department
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.400]   at DFA or Avantis, but the kinds of people
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.240]   who are in the trenches dealing with these questions of risk
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:41.040]   and return and asset allocation.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.040]   I hope that helps at some level.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:47.520]   In other words, what I'm saying is, take Chris's advice
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.960]   is the best advice that I have.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.640]   Now, every once in a while--
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:55.560]   recently, somebody wrote to us and made a claim.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.360]   And in fact, I don't know if this has come out yet
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.200]   in a podcast.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.120]   But what they did was, they said,
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.640]   why do you have small cap blend in the portfolio?
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.440]   Because small cap value almost always beats it.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:14.680]   And Daryl, who's an engineer, said, I'll take that.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.440]   And he did the study.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.080]   And he made it really simple.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.240]   And he showed the guy that he was wrong.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.680]   Often, small cap blend does better than small cap value.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.200]   But Daryl took all the years that it did.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.360]   And he boxed them.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.240]   So you could look at that quilt chart
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.600]   and see exactly all the years.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.000]   I would not have had the patience to do that.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.120]   I hope that helps, Brian.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.120]   Thank you for your kind comments.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.560]   Thank you so much.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:47.680]   Really appreciate the work you guys do is terrific.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.360]   You're welcome.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.280]   I appreciate it.
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.280]   OK.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.280]   Do you want to take one more?
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.560]   One more.
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.240]   Make it the hardest one you possibly can.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:01.840]   Right, and then I know there's a couple others
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.480]   that I'll get to Paul.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.200]   And he can-- well, I think it would
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.000]   be best if we didn't get to your question, if you email Paul.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.680]   And then he can directly answer your question.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.040]   And by the way, and I may either answer it--
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:18.600]   I may answer it directly if it's real easy.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.760]   If it's a longer comment, I will likely use it.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.040]   And I won't use anybody's name.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.840]   Nobody will know who it is.
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:30.720]   I'll answer it in a podcast or in a newsletter.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:31.960]   OK, great.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.960]   OK, so the last question is regarding
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.320]   equities and taxable accounts versus tax advantage accounts,
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.040]   do you mirror the four fund across both types of accounts?
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.280]   Will I have a large tax bill from portfolio turnover
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.040]   in the taxable account?
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.360]   Well, remember, these are ETFs, so they're
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.440]   going to be more tax efficient.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.200]   But I do want to recommend the book.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.640]   I want to recommend--
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.720]   I did this before, but Your Complete Guide
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:07.760]   to a Successful, Secure Retirement, Larry Swedro.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.400]   It's cheap, like $11 or something.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:16.560]   It tackles almost any complex subject, dividend stocks
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.560]   versus non-dividend stocks and how much to take out
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.000]   and all sorts of things.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.800]   One of the things it covers in here
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:28.360]   is investment asset class placement.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.600]   Where does an asset class belong in a portfolio?
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.120]   What part should be in taxable?
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:40.360]   What part should be in a 401(k) or a Roth?
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.400]   And I really think it is worth the time
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.440]   to read his part of the book on that.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.120]   It's done very well.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:53.600]   And again, we do not try to help people make those decisions.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:58.200]   And Larry Swedro has looked at this very carefully.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.880]   And then the question is, do you want
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.640]   to take the time as an investor to build a portfolio that
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.200]   to take the four parts of that portfolio
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.360]   and spread part of it using the taxable account
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:16.080]   and part of it doing in the tax deferred or tax free,
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.160]   that tends to become work to be.
