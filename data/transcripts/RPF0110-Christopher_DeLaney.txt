[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I thank you for being here.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.480]   Today is Tuesday, December 2nd, 2014.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.600]   And today, we're going to spend a little time on the saving money side of the equation.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   Talk about using bicycles as a form of transportation.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   One of the benefits is saving a bunch of money, but there are some other benefits as well.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   ♪
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.600]   My guest is a listener of the show. It's a man named Christopher Delaney.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.840]   And he reached out to me and said, "Hey, if you're ever interested in doing a show on riding bikes,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040]   I would love to do that."
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.320]   And I responded right away to him and said, "I would like to do a show on riding bikes,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   because I'm totally intimidated by the idea.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.280]   But I'd love to find somebody who's done it."
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880]   And he kind of described the situation.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.920]   I said, "This is perfect."
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   And it's a great interview. It really is.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's an interview that's packed of information.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760]   No kind of like hardcore.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   I mean, it is pretty hardcore.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.320]   Christopher's pretty hardcore.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.520]   But he's pretty down to earth, so he's easy to talk to and easy to listen to.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.480]   And he shares some very practical advice about using bicycles as transportation.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   This was something that I had also interviewed on the show, Tammy Strobel.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.160]   And she's famous for writing a book, among other things, from Rowdy Kitten.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.400]   She had written a book on how to live car-free.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.840]   But by the time we had our interview, it wasn't something that she really thought much about
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.880]   or talked much about, even though she and her husband used bicycles a lot.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.320]   So I wanted to bring another resource.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.360]   So here I have an excellent show with Christopher Delaney.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.520]   It's really good. I hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Thanks so much for being here today.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.640]   A couple of quick announcements.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.560]   We're back in the saddle here after last week kind of missing out again.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.240]   I apologize to all of you for missing two of those shows.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.800]   I will-- again, I didn't-- I know better.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.720]   And I was thinking, I've got to create a really great show.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.160]   But I had interviews lined up, and I just should have prioritized and adjusted differently
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.360]   to get the shows done.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.760]   So I apologize for those of you that wondered where we went.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.640]   We're back now.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840]   And I anticipate a full month of December.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.880]   I've got a bunch of great interviews.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   I've got a bunch of more topics.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.120]   So we've got a lot to cover here in December.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.600]   I've been thinking about what changes and what adjustments to make for next year.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.200]   And so I'll talk more about that in the future.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   There are a lot of things I'd love to do, but it's just a matter of capacity
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.920]   as far as what I'm able to do with things going forward.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   That's always the challenge, the difference between what I'd like to do and what I'm able to do.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000]   I'm actually in conversations this week with a potential sponsor.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   That is the first sponsor that I've been able to find that I would feel good about introducing.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   To you, we'll see how those talks go.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.320]   We'll see if we can reach an agreement that I think is a win-win for everyone involved.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.960]   But if it works out, it's basically trying to answer the question that many of you ask me.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   How do I find a good financial advisor?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.880]   And it's a financial advisor vetting service.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.480]   And I think it's the best one that's out there.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.600]   Not perfect, but I think it's the best one that I've been able to find.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.960]   So we'll see if that works.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.000]   So stay tuned for the show.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.480]   We're going to have a great December here.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.080]   Thank you all so much for being here.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.360]   Here is Christopher.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.240]   So Christopher, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.760]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.320]   Absolutely.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.600]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.360]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.920]   Awesome.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.680]   So I'm excited to talk about bicycling and bike riding as an alternative method of transportation.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.200]   And I am a complete dunce when it comes to this topic.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.880]   But I know that you are not.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   You and your family have been able to live successfully for at least some period of time
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.640]   without a car.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.400]   And you said you have two kids, right?
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.800]   Yeah, I have two little girls.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.840]   One of them is two years old and the other one is about six months old.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   Awesome.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   So tell me your story as it surrounds your ability to use a bike for transportation.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.000]   I'm fascinated by this.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.000]   I was, you know, my imagination was expanded greatly in about 2005 when I moved to Portland,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   Oregon.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   I grew up in Georgia.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.760]   And, you know, in the South, there's really no alternative to using a car to get around
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.320]   places.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   There's no public transportation, very little bicycle infrastructure, if any at all.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   And I went to school in Alabama and got my first bike there.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.160]   It was a mountain bike.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   And my roommate was the one that introduced me to riding a bike.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.720]   To the grocery store or riding a bike to school or whatnot.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.520]   Started doing that.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.640]   Eventually decided it was time, you know, to leave Alabama.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.320]   And I moved west.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.000]   I lived in Louisiana for a little bit.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.360]   And then I moved to Colorado.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.480]   I was a ski instructor for a little bit and then met some folks there that lived in Oregon.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.640]   And they invited me to come visit Portland.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.200]   And so I went out there and fell in love with it.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.480]   You know, decided a couple months later, I was going to go to California.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.720]   Decided a couple months later to move to Portland.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:01.600]   And I sold my car that was back in Georgia and went to Oregon with my guitar and a backpack,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.100]   basically.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.700]   Nice.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.920]   When I got there, I found out the public transit was fantastic.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.960]   You can take a train from the airport into the city.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.600]   The bus system is great.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.080]   And I used that for a while.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.000]   And then I saw people riding bicycles around and decided, you know, that looks pretty fun.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.680]   So I went on Craigslist.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   I found a cheap $150 bike that seemed all right.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.960]   I didn't really know anything about bikes at that point.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.800]   And started riding my bike around town and, you know, gradually went to more places.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.040]   I was riding it to my school.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.960]   And then I started going to the grocery store.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.400]   And then I started, you know, going to visit friends and going to restaurants and bars
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   on the weekend and things like that.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.000]   And my confidence level started to increase.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.760]   And I started riding pretty much everywhere.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.840]   That lasted me up until the point when I met my wife and we got married about four years later.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:10.320]   From when I had moved to Portland, she had a car and she, you know, she had a bicycle as well.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   But she wasn't riding her bike necessarily for transportation.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.440]   It was more just for fun to meet friends at coffee shops.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.760]   Or just ride around the neighborhood a little bit.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.360]   And then when she met me, you know, I started rubbing off a little bit.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.480]   You know, she would ride with me to a date night or a friend's house or something like that.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.320]   And started, you know, expanding her imagination about what was possible.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.520]   And she really enjoyed it.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.680]   We moved right after we got married, we moved right away pretty much to Denver for a job.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.480]   And in Denver, we found out that I needed a car to get to my job.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.600]   So, you know, obviously we kept the car that we had and shared it.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.520]   And basically, you know, I would use it to get to work.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.480]   And then my wife had a bike that she would ride to just kind of get around the city there.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.440]   We lived downtown.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.080]   And, you know, I tried riding to work on my bike.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.760]   It was 25 miles each way.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.360]   I worked at the airport.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.920]   And, you know, if you aren't familiar with Denver, the airport's 25 miles east of the
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.840]   city out in the middle of a bunch of farmland.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.600]   It's very sparse.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.760]   And it was pretty dangerous, in my opinion, for me to ride my bike out there just because
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.360]   of the speeds that people were traveling on these two-lane farm roads.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.520]   My co-workers would regularly brag about, you know, going 80, 90, 100 miles an hour
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.280]   on these back roads and catching air over, you know, little hills that existed.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.600]   And so, you know, I was commuting when it was dark in the morning and I just decided,
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   you know, it's not worth it, you know, getting killed by one of my co-workers driving 100
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.400]   miles an hour on these farm roads.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.760]   And so I pretty much resigned myself to driving the car every day.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.440]   I wasn't super excited about it.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.040]   But it was 25 miles each way.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.440]   Pretty impractical for a daily commute on a bike to do 50 miles.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.760]   You know, on my wife and I's radar, we didn't have kids at the time.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.360]   And we wanted our life to be a little bit more localized where everything was, you know,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.120]   within five or 10 miles and we didn't have to necessarily use a car.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.880]   We started talking about what we would do when we got a family.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:44.720]   And we had seen online and a few times in person this bike called a cargo bike.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.240]   And it has a large box in the front.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   It's typically known as a Bock Feets.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.160]   It came from Europe.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.680]   And there are a couple of folks who make them here in the United States.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.120]   And so we started talking to the people here in Oregon who made it.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   The company was called Metro Feets.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.760]   We got our hands on one to test ride and absolutely fell in love with the bike.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.680]   And we said, you know, when we have kids, we would love to get one of these bikes.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.120]   And that would really help us continue to get around the city,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.080]   but also reduce our dependence on the car that we had.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.480]   And while we were in Denver, we had our first child.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   And we started strategizing how we could get the bike.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.200]   At that time, you know, we couldn't really afford it.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   So we had to wait.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   And then we ended up moving to Wyoming.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.160]   We moved to Casper, Wyoming.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.800]   It's a small town, dead center of the state.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.920]   About 50,000 people live there and move there for a job.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.400]   And that's when we really started considering selling our car, becoming car free,
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.120]   and buying one of these bikes.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:59.600]   In April of 2013, my wife said she was ready.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240]   And she was willing to at least try this as an experiment.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.760]   And, you know, I'm pretty confident and motivated about, you know,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.040]   using bikes for transportation.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.960]   But I really didn't want to pressure her into that.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.560]   I wanted her to come to that on her own.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.600]   And so I just patiently waited for, you know, a couple years after we were married
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.840]   until she was like, you know, I think I'm ready to try this.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.720]   And I'm really on board.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   So we sold our car and we got a Metrofeet's cargo bike.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.760]   And we started living car free in Casper, Wyoming.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.720]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.600]   We both fell in love with it right off the bat.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.480]   We really enjoyed getting around with our daughter in the bike.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   She was a little over one years old when we first started riding with her in the bike.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.840]   I think she was maybe one and a half or two.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:55.200]   And then in January of this year, we moved back to Portland, which is my wife's hometown.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   And, you know, we've been living car free here as well.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   You know, in addition to the bike, we also use the Zipcar membership, which is a car
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.320]   sharing program that allows us to have access to a car if we need it.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:18.080]   And, you know, it's been pretty enjoyable and relatively easy for us, to be honest.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   But that's a little bit about our story there.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.320]   So, I mean, you've got some credibility here.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.040]   How long has it been since you actually sold your car when you were living in Wyoming?
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.540]   Two years?
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.680]   Almost.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.800]   I think it's been about a year and a half that we've been car free as a family.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.400]   Me personally, you know, I've been car free for the majority of the last decade.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.480]   I think, you know, I had a car after I met my wife and we moved to Denver for two years.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:56.400]   But, you know, after selling that, we've been car free for maybe about a year and a half.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.640]   And also you've been able to live with one car for the entirety of your marriage.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.560]   So, you know, even if many families just switch to having one car, I know that's what my wife
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.400]   and I have done, I couldn't see and still can't see any way that in where we live,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.480]   in I think the biggest county in the United States with a very distributed, spread out
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   lifestyle, I couldn't see any way to do without one car, excuse me, without a car.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.560]   But even just going from two to one saved me so much time and hassle of fixing the thing
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.520]   and getting oil changes.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.200]   And I was glad to get rid of that second car.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   Absolutely.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.400]   If I could figure it out, I'd get rid of the first one.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.560]   But I haven't been able to figure that out.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.760]   It's tough.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.440]   And I think it has to do with it's not an all or nothing decision.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.560]   I think that would be more detrimental for people to make that as an all or nothing decision.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.320]   It's more of a reduction mindset.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.760]   So, you know, finding ways that you can reduce your dependence on that because it sucks so
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.720]   much money out of your life.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   You know, AAA says it costs nine thousand dollars a year to own and maintain a vehicle,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.880]   not including car payments.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.040]   And that was in 2013, I think, when that came out, 2012, maybe.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.800]   So with inflation, you know, that number only keeps growing.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.600]   But, you know, nine thousand dollars a year is significant.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.680]   And if you can start thinking about ways to reduce your dependence on that and to be creative
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:32.320]   in structuring your life so you don't necessarily need the car as much, those things are definitely
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:32.880]   positive.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.840]   And it can help people make a transition there when you view it as, you know, incremental,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.120]   small incremental changes.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   Right.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.360]   So I've heard of Portland being a bike mecca, but I haven't heard of Casper, Wyoming being
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.400]   a biking mecca.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.000]   What's the difference between living in a place?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.680]   And I assume I'm right about that.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.240]   But what's the difference between living in a place where there is a well-established
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.880]   infrastructure versus a place where I'm assuming there's not?
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:12.400]   I personally think it's about the same because when we were in Casper, there might have been
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.840]   out of the 50,000 people that live there, there might have been 10 people.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.080]   And that's being extremely generous using a bike for transportation.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.240]   And I knew probably half of those folks.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.200]   You know, I could see folks riding around and, you know, there's only 10 of us out of
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.000]   50,000.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.840]   So it was less than 1%.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:40.880]   In Portland, about 6 to 10% of the population uses a bike on a daily basis for transportation,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.920]   which is significant.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.720]   Wow.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:50.320]   But the 90% that don't are the same as the 99% or the 100% of people in Casper.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.760]   So the attitudes of the city, the attitudes of the drivers are largely the same regardless
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.640]   wherever you live.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.640]   You know, auto culture in the United States is very much considered an entitlement.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:13.520]   And so, you know, being in Casper and riding a bike to me is no different.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   It doesn't take any more confidence or any less confidence than it takes to ride a bike
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.560]   on the streets in Portland.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:28.080]   You're still up against pretty much the same barriers, the same challenges, whether, you
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.400]   know, aggressive drivers, city streets that don't support everybody using them.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.480]   They only support one type of transportation.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.200]   That's what I found.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:49.600]   I mean, it is in a sense easier here in Portland, but not significantly, I don't think.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.240]   Why do you do it?
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.040]   Is this like your crusade to support your political belief or personal values?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.240]   Or is this just because you like being frugal and don't like spending money on a hunk of
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.680]   metal that sits in the garage?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.320]   Why do you do it?
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.520]   Yeah, it's a little bit of both of those things.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.360]   My wife and I have a very strong values attachment to this decision.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   But then at the same time, when we actually calculated our finances, we found out that
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.600]   we would save $700 a month by getting rid of our car.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.320]   And so there's a huge financial benefit to making that decision.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.720]   You know, and that's a composite number.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.800]   It's different for a lot of people.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.320]   But for us, we had a car payment.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.200]   We had insurance.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.560]   We had gas.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.680]   And then we were budgeting money every month for maintenance because for whatever reason,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.120]   the car that we had was sucking the maintenance life out of us.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.360]   It was ridiculous.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.840]   In any case, we decided $700 was about what we were saving every month on that.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:04.640]   There also was a very strong values commitment because my wife and I have both spent time
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.600]   traveling internationally.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:13.840]   We're very sensitive to the relationship between American foreign policy and resource extraction,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.040]   i.e. oil, or what it takes to get that.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.920]   There's another thing, too.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:31.760]   I grew up in a pretty conservative religious family where you hear the term pro-life thrown
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.800]   around a lot.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:42.000]   And one of the things that my wife and I were very passionate about is there's about 46,000
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.520]   people a year that die in the United States from automobile collisions.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.000]   And that number, the UN says that's 1.4 million people per year in the world.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.440]   And we thought that that was a pro-life issue.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:09.360]   Decreasing our car use, in part, was because we want to prevent the causes of death.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.720]   And that's one of the highest causes of death worldwide.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.520]   From the externalities of it, when you look at things like climate change, when you look at
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:27.760]   the actual automobile collisions that are killing people, you look at the intoxication
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:35.440]   deaths that are caused by people walking, riding bikes, and driving cars that are intoxicated.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.360]   That was one thing.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   Another thing, we definitely wanted to stop contributing money to this global war for
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.800]   resources and global war for oil.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.760]   And we're not to the point where we're going to stop paying our taxes, but we did want
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:59.520]   to vote with our dollar, as it were, and stop giving money to the corporations and the governments
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.160]   that are creating these environments.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.920]   I like that.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.800]   It's nice to hear somebody integrate fully pro-life.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   It's one of the things that always bugs me, because I am profoundly, as a person, I am
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.400]   profoundly pro-life in every way.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:23.920]   And it so bugs me when somebody says, "Well, I'm pro-life in terms of taking care of the
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.720]   babies, but we can kill all the other people on the other side of the world for useless,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.680]   stupid reasons."
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.960]   Well, wait a second.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.800]   Why don't you be a little consistent here?
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.760]   Why don't you be consistent with your beliefs, and you're either pro-life or you're pro-death?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.000]   And so we have this odd mixture.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.040]   Yeah, when people look at things factually, take Ebola, for example, that's killed, at
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.920]   high estimates, around maybe 10,000 people.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:58.720]   With automobile culture and design and the way that we're using that technology, it kills
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.560]   1.4 million people per year, and that number is growing.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:08.240]   What's the more dire situation that we need to address as a global community?
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.160]   Not saying Ebola is not important, but if we were to look at the actual danger factor
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:21.840]   involved, I'm a pilot as well, and everybody knows the little statement, "You're more likely
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.200]   to die on the way to the airport than you are actually in a plane crash."
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:35.200]   Providing evidence that it is way more dangerous to ride in a car or to drive a car than it
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.280]   is to fly in this metal tube at 30,000 feet across the world.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:45.840]   I think that was something interesting, and I'm a pretty passionate person, and so I was
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:53.520]   very motivated not to just talk about being pro-life, but to incorporate that into as
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.840]   many areas of my life as I could, and this seemed to be a very natural output for that.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.520]   I like that, and the cool thing is it serves your own self-interest, too.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.600]   You're healthier and you're richer, and you can support your values.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.480]   It's nice when those things line up together.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.200]   Sometimes you have to impoverish yourself a little bit, maybe, to stand up for some
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.840]   of your views and opinions and to fight for what you perceive to be right, but it's nice
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.120]   when you can fight for what you perceive to be right, and it puts money in your pocket,
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.280]   too.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.720]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.480]   So, I am a novice when it comes to riding a bicycle.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:38.160]   Obviously, I was a kid, grew up riding one, but I never even considered using a bicycle
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.040]   as transportation.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.840]   A bicycle was just always something fun, and then where my living situation, where I live
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.720]   in Palm Beach County, Florida, it is one of the most spread out counties, I think, in
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.120]   the country.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.480]   I can't remember, but it might be the biggest county in the country, or it might be.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.200]   Maybe not.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.040]   I don't know, but it's a pretty large one.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.560]   So, I've always commuted.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.080]   I always lived, when I was growing up, 20 miles from my school, and just always commuted.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.440]   Never even considered riding a bicycle until my wife and I were married, and I started
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   living in downtown West Palm.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.000]   And I hadn't had a bicycle for years, and then we decided to get one so we could go
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.280]   on bike rides together.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.360]   She had one that was left over from about sixth grade, and so we went down to Walmart,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.040]   and I got a $99 special on a beach cruiser, a larger, tired beach cruiser, which was a
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.000]   little bit more suitable for my, and I'm about 6'6".
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.800]   But what I found is that it was cool, and it was pretty cool to be able to ride it around
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.280]   West Palm.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.480]   We'd ride it down to the beach.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.520]   We'd ride it, you know, the Green Market on Saturday morning.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.400]   We'd ride down on Thursday night to the bookstore.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.200]   Sometimes we'd walk.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.080]   Sometimes we'd ride.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.240]   But we wound up riding it a lot.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.760]   And then, when we moved out to Palm Beach Gardens, we continued riding it, and then
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.600]   I wound up, it got stolen for reasons that, well, actually, I'll tell the story, 'cause
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.480]   this is kind of interesting.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.000]   I rode it to the mall for, we live fairly near a mall, and so I tried to ride my bike
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.600]   instead of having to use the car.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.200]   And I locked it one day.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.120]   There were no bike racks, so I locked it to a railing, and I came back, and the bike was
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.280]   gone, and I deduced that it hadn't been stolen.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.440]   It had been clipped by the security guards.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.480]   So I went after him, and I found the bike and got them to actually, which is pretty
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.760]   cool, I got them to actually pay me the 20 bucks for the bike lock that they'd chopped,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.600]   'cause there were no bike racks there.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.480]   And so they gave me the bike, and the head of security was so annoyed at me, he gave
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.240]   me 20 bucks from his desk to buy myself another bike lock.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.080]   And then I rode it to my office the next day, and I didn't have a bike lock, and I was
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.360]   lazy about getting one, and three days later, it disappeared from my office.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.720]   So I am now bike-less and have been for a year or so.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.600]   I just switched to walking to work instead of biking to work.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.320]   But what I realized was that my Cruiser was not the optimal choice for transportation.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.440]   It was slow, and the tires were so fat, it wasn't very good.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.880]   And I realized, I know nothing about bicycles.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.120]   So if I were interested, since you've done this a little bit, if I were interested in
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.880]   actually saying, "I'd like to get a bike that would actually be useful and practical.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.920]   I'm not sure about commuting every day, I'm not sure about being a nut like you and driving,
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:24.120]   what'd you say, 25 miles to the airport in Denver, but I'm interested in getting a bicycle."
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.320]   Where would I start, and what advice would you have for me as a novice person who rides
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   a bicycle?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.520]   Yeah, totally.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:37.280]   There's a paradigm shift for most people that would be a good place to start.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.780]   So when you're looking at a bicycle in the United States, a lot of people in their head
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.240]   are thinking recreation.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   And so when you make the switch to wanting to use a bike for transportation, you kind
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.000]   of have to think about things a little bit differently.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.960]   So I like to use the car paradigm as an example.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.700]   Would you buy a car sight unseen, offline?
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.160]   Probably not.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:14.040]   Would you buy a car from a real seedy used car dealer in a bad part of town next to the
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.680]   payday loan office and the video poker establishment?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.200]   Not if you listen to Joshua's show and have an ounce of common sense.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.280]   Sure, probably not.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.520]   People say when you start seeing strip clubs and payday loans, you know you're in a part
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.580]   of town that's just going to be trying to take advantage of you.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.440]   And so that's where all the used car dealerships pop up.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.480]   And if you walk into one of those places, you're just asking to be taken advantage of,
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.960]   unfortunately.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.240]   Most people that are going to buy a car would do their research.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.960]   They would connect with a mechanic, potentially, if they don't know what they're doing, because
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.100]   that way when they find something used, they can get it evaluated.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:07.680]   And then if you're looking at purchasing something new, which I know is not very popular in the
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.600]   community that we're in, you would go do your research on a dealership and find one that
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.080]   is reputable, that's going to stand behind their vehicle, possibly offer a warranty as
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.280]   a part of that.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:28.320]   All of those same considerations would apply to purchasing a bicycle for transportation.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.480]   It's going to be significantly less money, so there's not as much pressure on the purchase.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.560]   So some basic things.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.200]   Now bike shops are offering loans for bikes or credit cards with their company.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.800]   I wouldn't recommend going into debt for this at all.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.160]   First off, if you have a bike, ride what you have.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.200]   If you don't have a bike, buying something used is a good idea, spending as little money
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.900]   as possible for something quality.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:05.000]   So just like with a car, the first thing I do is find a bike shop who will do a used
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.920]   bike evaluation for you.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:13.640]   Very common, pretty much all bike shops will do it, all mechanics will do it.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.800]   That's probably the first thing I do is find a bike shop and make sure that they will be
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.400]   able to do an evaluation on a used bike.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:26.520]   Then get on Craigslist or whatever your online marketplace is in your city and find something
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.080]   local is preferable because then you can have it checked out.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.720]   I would stay away from buying anything online.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.120]   I would stay away from buying anything from Walmart.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:43.000]   Walmart for bikes is the same thing as a seedy used car dealer in a bad part of town.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.640]   I learned that with my Cruiser because it looked all fancy and shiny and I'm like, "Ah,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.120]   it's cheap and it's great."
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.000]   And then I got it home and I parked it underneath an overhang and three days later, everything
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   that wasn't the fancy shiny chrome frame was rusting and nothing, it just started falling
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.320]   apart almost immediately.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.600]   So I recognize there's a little bit of a difference in quality between a Walmart bike versus what
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   I would assume somebody else would be able to ride every day.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:21.320]   Yeah, when you buy a bike from a department store like Walmart or the mall or whatever
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.760]   happens to be, the person putting that bike together is not a mechanic and they have no
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:33.200]   knowledge whatsoever of what that bike needs to be safe.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   And it may sound a little harsh and I don't mean it as a critique on the people that work
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   in those establishments.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.240]   I'm just speaking from experience that that's usually not a good idea because the bike is
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:54.680]   a machine and you wouldn't let a grocery store employee fix your car.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:00.380]   For the same reason, I wouldn't let a Walmart employee build my bike.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.420]   There are some safety considerations in that.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.520]   So a good starting place, connect with a shop, find something used and do it.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.000]   Now if you have the money and you want to get a new bike, that would definitely work
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.160]   in your favor because you'll rule out a lot of the mechanical problems that you'd have.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.420]   Most bike shops in America are oriented towards recreation and fitness and so they're not
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.340]   necessarily oriented towards transportation.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:33.000]   If you live in a larger urban area, you might be able to find a shop that is oriented towards
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.140]   transportation.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:43.320]   Cities like Minneapolis, Austin, Denver, Portland, Seattle, LA, New York City, those are ones
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.840]   that come to mind that I know have transportation-oriented bike shops.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.200]   Every other city in the country is going to have a bike shop more than likely and the
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:58.920]   sales staff is not necessarily going to know what is going to work well in a transportational
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:04.480]   sense so you'll need to do a little bit of internet research to find out what brands
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.560]   they offer and then what bikes within that brand work well for transportation.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.840]   Some basic questions that you want to ask when you go in, make sure you say up front
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.040]   that you're looking to use this for transportation.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.400]   Be ready for some really silly reactions.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.240]   They might congratulate you and say, "We're really excited that you're taking this step,"
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.080]   or they might say, "That's impossible.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.000]   There's no way that's going to work safely."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.240]   Don't listen to any of the negative talk unless the person is knowledgeable, saying, "Stay
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.120]   away from this part of town," or, "Use these streets."
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.800]   If that's the kind of feedback you're getting, it's excellent.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.900]   But if it's globally negative, like, "This is never going to work.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.200]   This is the dumbest idea I've ever heard," completely ignore it.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:56.640]   In any case, look for a bike that has the ability or already installed fenders and a
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.760]   front or rear rack.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.520]   Usually a bike that will have those elements will be good.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.560]   Things that are preferred are large tires and disc brakes.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.020]   They work really well for transportation bikes.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.520]   Not a necessity, but definitely preferred.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.920]   And then you're going to want to make sure that you budget a little bit of money for
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   accessories.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.560]   So whatever your budget is, take 75% of that, spend it on the bike.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:34.040]   Take the other 25%, and you'll need to buy, at the minimum, a front light and a rear light,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:41.360]   white and red, respectively, and a U-lock, something that looks like a U or a D. Those
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.160]   are the most secure.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   And then if you've got a little bit of extra money on top of that, I'd look to buy waterproof
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.240]   bags and a rear-view mirror.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.640]   And the rear-view mirror can attach to your bike or a helmet if you choose to wear one.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   Yeah, I've got to imagine with biking, the gear makes all the difference in the world.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.520]   Just as simple as having a basket.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.840]   So if you have something to put, or like I said, a bag to strap stuff to, that makes
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.200]   all the difference in the world.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   Absolutely.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   And there's so many choices.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.520]   If you're a basket person and you want a basket up front to just toss your purse or your backpack
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.020]   in, that's really easy.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:25.080]   If you like the waterproof bags that can strap onto your rack, that's really easy, too.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.400]   And there are lots of great choices for that.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   But there's no reason to buy all of that up front.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.880]   Just the lights and the lock are really what you need.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.720]   So probably also, though, should you steer away from things like fat tires, like mountain
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.560]   bikes, I would imagine are probably suboptimal unless you're riding up and down a mountain.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.880]   So you should probably get something with skinny tires if you're going to be on roads.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   Is that right?
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   Not necessarily.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.800]   I would actually prefer not to ride on skinny tires.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:02.320]   My tires right now are the thickness of a mountain bike tire, but they don't have the
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:09.640]   little knobs on them like what mountain bike tires would have on it.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.760]   They're smooth and they have a little bit of siping, so they kind of look like a smaller
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.400]   motorcycle tire, basically.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.920]   It depends on where you live.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:28.680]   I've met people that commute daily in Alaska, and they need what's called a fat bike, where
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.640]   it has these huge tires on it that run at really low pressure, and they ride over gravel
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   and dirt and whatever.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.160]   It depends on the safest way to get where you're going, what it looks like.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:45.280]   For some people, I've spent a lot of time in the South, in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:52.520]   There are a lot of unpaved dirt paths that go places.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.200]   That's why I like recommending buying a used bike first, because then you find out what
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.060]   you actually need.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.960]   If you start off with a skinny tire bike and you find out, "Wow, the easiest way for me
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   to get to work is to ride a little bit on this dirt path," then when you actually buy
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.920]   a bike new, you'll get one that fits your needs a little bit better.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   Right.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   Do brands matter?
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.800]   Is there a specific brand that you should look for that's a good entry-level brand,
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.880]   or does that just matter as far as what the bike shop actually carries?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:30.400]   Branding is important only to the extent of the support from the manufacturer.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:36.640]   Most bicycles that are sold in the world are either made in China or Taiwan.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.320]   Those are really the only two places in the world.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.680]   You can buy an American-made bike, but it will cost you thousands of dollars and be
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.440]   a little bit impractical for folks who are starting off.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:57.360]   Bikes that are made in Taiwan are typically superior to bikes that are made in China.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.860]   I would steer away from anything carbon fiber.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:07.040]   That will not benefit you in any way.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.680]   This goes back to the Walmart discussion.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.760]   Brands usually partner with the shop to provide support for that bike.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:26.000]   For example, if you went with a larger brand like Specialized, Trek, or Felt, Raleigh,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.360]   there's maybe 10 well-respected manufacturers for bikes in the United States.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.280]   They will offer excellent support for that bike.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.440]   If something breaks on it, it can be warrantied.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.120]   If you crash and you need to replace the bike, a lot of times they'll offer loyalty programs
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.360]   to replace the parts, even though it was your fault and it wasn't theirs.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.080]   That kind of support is really invaluable to someone, especially if you don't have mechanical
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.240]   knowledge.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.640]   Developing a relationship with a bike shop is very important because they can help support
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   you.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.780]   Flat tires, mechanical issues.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.020]   Sometimes you'll be able to find riding support and group rides that will help you get a little
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.420]   bit more comfortable on the road riding with cars with other people who know what they're
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.420]   doing and they can help give you those skills.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.880]   Those are all the things that come with a brand.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.640]   Usually brands are exclusive at certain bike shops.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.680]   One shop will only sell Trek.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.840]   Another shop will only sell Specialized.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.320]   The way that the manufacturers develop their relationships with bike shops is they mandate
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.360]   that orientation.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.280]   It's important for the support aspect of it.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.480]   For the actual rideability of the bike, they're pretty much all the same.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.280]   They all have a chain, they all have gears, and they all have wheels.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.360]   That's basically what you need.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.820]   There's no reason to overcomplicate that.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.600]   Pretty much all bike shops are going to sell essentially the same thing.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.400]   You're basically buying into that brand support.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.760]   When you're looking for a bike, you can go to a variety of bike shops and try things
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   out.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.040]   Ride as many bikes as you want.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.840]   Bike shops are always happy to have people go in and test ride things.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.080]   That would give you more of an idea of what you're drawn to, what style of bike you're
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   drawn to.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.000]   Dave: Is there a price range that if I were shopping for a bike for transportation that
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.260]   I would want them, for a new one, I'm sure used ones will vary, but is there a price
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.760]   range that would be a reasonable entry-level price range to consider?
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   Ryan: Yeah.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:49.000]   If you're buying a bike used, I would expect to spend around $500 for something that's
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.640]   high enough quality to use it for transportation.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.600]   If you're buying a bike new, I would expect to spend around $1,000.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.000]   It puts you in the middle bracket of what a bike shop will offer.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.480]   You don't necessarily want to buy the cheapest thing possible.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.720]   The cheapest thing possible is designed for someone who will occasionally use their bike,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   maybe a couple times a year to ride on a trail with family.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.200]   Maybe the grandkids come and you pull the bikes out and everybody goes out for one day
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.480]   a year.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.120]   The cheapest bike is designed for that individual.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   In the mid-range, you're going to find a lot of bikes that are good for everyday use, but
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.680]   that aren't so nice that you're afraid of it getting damaged or stolen or broken.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.080]   The quality of the components is important when buying a bike for transportation.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:51.520]   I would expect to say $1,000 is reasonable to get something that's decent, durable quality,
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.760]   but also something that is not so nice where you have to be afraid of locking it up outside
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.640]   the movie theater or something.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.760]   For me, it was a slap in the face when I walked into a bike shop one time and here I am.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.200]   I'm in the $99 Walmart special mindset.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.600]   All of a sudden, I go in and it's $1,000.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   I couldn't even conceive of it.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.840]   I can totally see you're exactly right.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.680]   If there's a big difference between how I often in the past used a bike where a couple
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:27.000]   times a year you brush it off and ride a few miles versus something that's designed to
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.560]   be used on a daily basis.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.520]   I learned my lesson with my $99 special when stuff was breaking on it.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:39.040]   I rode it more frequently than any bike I ever had and it fell apart.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:44.760]   We have to think about it in terms of how important where you're going is.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.600]   I ride to work every day.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.440]   I am a responsible employee.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.040]   I don't like to show up late.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.440]   I don't like to call in sick and things like that.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   If I'm going to ride my bike in, I still want to be an excellent employee.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.880]   I don't want any of those things to get in the way.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:12.320]   I have really nice, rather expensive tires I've invested a lot in that don't get flat
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.840]   really at all.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:21.340]   I have over 10,000 miles on one pair of tires and never had a flat, which is great.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:27.840]   If you spend the money to invest in quality parts in certain areas of the bike, you can
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.440]   trust in that.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.160]   I will leave a little bit more early than I normally would had I been driving to give
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.760]   myself some time just in case I get a flat or something happens.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:44.880]   I'll have time to catch a bus or call a friend to get to work just in case something happens.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.240]   It never has happened.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.720]   I've never had to call in sick or call a friend or whatever.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.080]   I like to know that I've built some extra time into my schedule so it's not going to
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.400]   affect getting to work on time.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.380]   When you think about it that way, you don't want to skimp on the money.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.740]   Skimping on the money side of things or skimping on the durability, sacrificing that could
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:16.180]   sacrifice another relationship that you have that depends on you transporting yourself
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.820]   there.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:25.740]   If you're just using it to go to the grocery store, obviously at that point you could afford
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:31.900]   to skimp a little bit on durability because what are the consequences of you not making
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.140]   it to the grocery store?
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.520]   Not that great.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.500]   No one's depending on you to be there.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.120]   It doesn't mark negatively on your career if you don't get there on time.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.540]   If that's your goal, then you don't need something as expensive or as durable.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:52.460]   For me, my work bike, just to give you an example, with all the things I have on it,
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.420]   it costs about $2,000.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.420]   I have a generator hub in the front that generates electricity when I pedal.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:08.140]   It powers all of my lighting so I never have to change batteries and it's always on.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.500]   I've got a rack with waterproof bags.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.420]   I have a Bluetooth speaker that connects to my phone so I can listen to podcasts and the
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:21.380]   radio and make and receive phone calls while I'm riding my bike.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.220]   Those are some of the things that help make that choice and that lifestyle a little bit
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.220]   easier.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.260]   Dave: The cool thing is I remember reading, I think it was Jacob Lundfisker wrote an article
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.580]   and he just talked about how if you're going to have the best car on the road, it's going
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   to take a lot of money.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.660]   To have the best bike on the road, any normal middle class person could easily afford it,
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.460]   especially if it's their primary or at least replacing one of their cars.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:52.820]   You go from a $5,000 car that's kind of middle of the road, pretty cheap car most people
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:58.700]   would consider, to a top of the line bicycle for $2,000, you're still saving money.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.080]   The riding experience, the enjoyment of it would probably be substantially better by
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:11.300]   having something really nice so it allows you to make that switch away from the car.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.580]   Ben: When you make that choice on a bicycle, it makes the price a little bit easier when
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.460]   it's a one-time thing.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:27.220]   You buy a car, say a new car for $30,000 or $40,000, that car still needs you to put $100
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.260]   per gas tank in that thing to actually run.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   When you buy a bike, that's a one-time cost.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.220]   That will always continue to work as long as you take care of it.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:43.140]   It removes that embedded cost or the need for anything else to make it go.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:48.480]   You just have to eat more burritos.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.340]   Whatever it is, they say miles per burrito instead of miles per hour.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.380]   Dave: How do you do this with kids?
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:55.380]   You've got two young kids.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.500]   What are some tips and tricks for being able to do this with kids successfully?
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.340]   Ben: That is considerably more challenging.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.860]   There are a lot of resources out there to help folks.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:18.340]   I know it's kind of hackneyed, but we always point towards the European model in, say,
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:25.460]   Holland and Denmark because they have been doing this for a lot longer.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.100]   They ride with kids, no problem.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   We look at their model, and a lot of them have special bikes designed to fit a child
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.580]   on them.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:44.140]   When you adapt a bicycle that's normally found in the United States to carry kids, it doesn't
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.860]   necessarily make it functional for transportation because just the weight of adding a child
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:56.900]   to a regular adult bicycle eliminates the ability to carry actual cargo.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:02.020]   You might be able to carry your child, but then you can't carry grocery bags and all
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.980]   the things that come with a child that you have to carry as well.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:13.260]   Diapers and spare clothes and wipes and food and all these other things are extra.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.380]   When you look at the European model, they have special bikes that are designed to carry
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.380]   children.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.460]   A couple types of those.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.980]   There's a tricycle model with two wheels up front and one wheel in the back.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.540]   It's got a big bucket in the front.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.340]   That's one.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.940]   I don't necessarily prefer that, but it's definitely an option.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.980]   Then there's a company that makes an extension to the back of an adult bicycle called an
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.300]   extra cycle.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.040]   That's the style of bike called a long tail.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.100]   Those are nice because kids can sit on the back and you have these two large bags that
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.380]   you can put things in.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:54.140]   Then there's the Bockfeet style where you have this big box up front, and it only has
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.140]   two wheels.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.540]   You steer with a steering linkage that goes underneath the box and connects to the front
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.060]   wheel.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:09.140]   It probably sounds weird hearing that described, but if you duck, duck, go, a Bockfeet ...
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.140]   Thank you.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.980]   I know what we're trying to do here.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.060]   If you search for the Bockfeet style, it'll pop up and you'll see a picture of it and
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.060]   it'll make sense.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.100]   They're not that hard to ride.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.860]   When riding with kids, the first consideration everybody has, and justifiably so, is is it
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.860]   safe?
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.940]   That's very important.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:41.700]   You need to be confident riding your normal route around your city before you want to
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.220]   carry your children.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.820]   You want to know where the safe streets are.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:51.740]   Safe streets are usually streets that have lower speed limits, ideally somewhere around
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.740]   15 to 20.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.940]   If your location ... I know being raised in the South, I know very few streets have that
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.020]   kind of speed limit.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:09.300]   In grid cities, larger cities that have a well-established historic grid, you're going
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.540]   to find lower speed limits just by design.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.580]   Those are going to be a little bit easier.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.620]   Be confident riding in your context before you add a child to that.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:25.100]   Even when you do add children to that, you want to make sure that they're safe and that
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.260]   you can see them and that they're strapped in.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:35.380]   A lot of places mandate helmet use for kids, which is a great thing.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:41.820]   Say here in Portland, any child, I think, under 12 has to wear a helmet.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.540]   Those are just the basics.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:51.220]   Both of my ... Our six-month-old is in a car seat strapped into our box.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.700]   I've actually screwed attachments in there and locked her car seat down to it.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.820]   Our other child is in a five-point harness style.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.020]   Maybe you can include a picture of our setup in the show notes.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.220]   Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.060]   That's just one thing among many.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.540]   You want to be able to carry all of your gear comfortably and be able to maneuver yourself
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.020]   on the bike.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:19.140]   Carrying three kids with a 50-pound backpack, not a good idea.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.260]   You want to be able to comfortably get on and off the bike.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.100]   I like riding with a rear-view mirror because you can increase your situational awareness
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.460]   and know what's going on around you.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:33.260]   That's really important for safety.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:39.580]   All of the safety things taken ... Once you get that taken care of, it's really, really,
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.060]   really fun.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:48.380]   That's one of the biggest reasons that we love getting around as a family on the bike.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.740]   My kids love it.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.020]   My two-year-old is always so excited to get on the bike.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.340]   She sees the world in a different way, and she gets to interact with us in a way that
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.480]   she couldn't if she were strapped into a car seat or whatnot.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   She can turn around.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.020]   We can look at each other.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.520]   We can carry on conversations.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.980]   We listen to music.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.680]   She loves the Frozen soundtrack.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.380]   We got that playing on the Bluetooth speaker.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.700]   We're going down the road singing Frozen as loud as we can.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.440]   It's a really fun experience.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.700]   It's interactive.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:29.560]   If you're driving in the car and your child is screaming and going nuts, it's very difficult
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:33.680]   to remedy that situation.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.660]   If we're going down the road on the bike and my daughter starts having a meltdown, we can
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.740]   just pull over and figure out what it is.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.500]   She's like, "Oh, I dropped my toy."
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.500]   Cool.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.460]   I'll pull over, pick it up, give it back to her.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.660]   We're back on the road, and everybody's happy.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.660]   It's just more interactive.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:52.860]   You didn't mention bike trailers.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.300]   Do you use a trailer at all, ever?
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.620]   I don't.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:06.100]   That was one of the main reasons that we got the box bike.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.980]   Trailers are designed for the recreational side of things.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:16.980]   If you're riding, if you look at any trailer website, they're going to show people on a
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:24.380]   recreational trail, not around cars, going rather slow when it's sunny and beautiful
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.660]   outside.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.220]   That's how a trailer is really designed.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:36.740]   When you use it for transportation, personally, I don't think it's very safe because the child
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:45.580]   is not connected to your bike other than this small connector that attaches to the axle.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.300]   That makes me a little uncomfortable.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:53.060]   It also is extended way past the bike in the back.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.300]   Sometimes folks don't see that.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.780]   If someone's driving behind you, they might see you on a bike, but they don't see the
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.620]   trailer which is much lower than you.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:07.060]   There have been instances of people getting rear-ended from behind because the person
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.900]   didn't see the trailer, but they saw the person on the bike.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:16.140]   Also, it separates you from your kids, so you can't really have a conversation.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.140]   You can't really talk.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.900]   They just sit back there and wait until you get to whatever your destination is.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:27.900]   It's a great way to make your kid fall asleep if you want.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.780]   That makes sense to me as far as kids.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:34.220]   I had a trailer for my bike before it was stolen, and I would use it to go to the grocery
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   store.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:40.100]   I did find it's an easy entryway with my $99 Walmart special.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.780]   I got a trailer from my brother and just stuck the thing on there.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.140]   I was able to go and haul my load of groceries.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   I felt pretty crunchy.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:52.300]   It was pretty funny going to the grocery store where I live.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.740]   I could get good parking.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.740]   The bike rack was empty, and I would park right in front of the store and just stick
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.780]   my trailer there on the sidewalk, which probably in biking places is a problem.
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:09.180]   It was kind of fun to go out with the Publix guy and load the bags of groceries into my
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.180]   trailer.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.180]   He said, "Are you serious?"
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.420]   It was a good entryway to actually using a bike to haul some cargo.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   That's great.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.300]   I love it for cargo.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.220]   They're not designed for that either.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.900]   Sometimes cargo can be really unstable in a trailer, but there are specific trailers
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.900]   designed for cargo.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:34.340]   I'm not that supportive of carrying children in a trailer.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.340]   Sure.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.340]   I understand that.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.340]   For transportation.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.940]   Now, if you're doing it on trails on the weekend for recreation and it's beautiful and sunny
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.980]   outside, that's one thing.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.020]   It's not that great for all types of weather.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.860]   It's not that great for riding on the road with cars.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:53.940]   It's not that visible and people aren't accustomed to looking for it.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:54:00.580]   Those are the things that I would definitely encourage folks away from a trailer for a
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.340]   long-term plan.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:09.260]   Short-term plan, yeah, it's great and easy to get into it, but long-term, I don't think
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:14.580]   it's the best or most ideal way to carry children on a bike.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.100]   Last question I got and then I'll let you give it some thought and just see if there's
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.100]   anything else you want to share.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:25.900]   A few years ago, I was in China and I noticed two things when I was there.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.780]   Number one is there's a massive number of scooters.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:30.780]   It was pretty cool to see.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:36.060]   I mean, there's just bazillions of little itty-bitty scooters and they're all decked
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:41.180]   out with face shields and these gloves, these winter gloves connected to the handlebars
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.300]   so people could use them.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.420]   There were tons and tons of those, which I think are an option that we should give a
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.940]   lot of thought to in the US, especially in urban areas.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:56.420]   But then also, there were tons and tons of the bikes with the electric, the battery power,
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.140]   the e-bikes.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:04.940]   What are your thoughts on that being helpful for somebody whose legs are not quite as strong
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.940]   as yours?
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.020]   Is that a helpful thing for someone to consider?
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.500]   I love e-bikes.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:15.740]   I absolutely love them and I think that it's extremely positive.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:21.700]   You talked about the trailer as being an easy way for people to get involved with carrying
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.460]   things on their bikes, whether it be kids or cargo or groceries, whatever it is.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:33.300]   I think the electric bikes are the exact same thing, just for individuals looking to ride
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.740]   a bike.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.820]   Not everybody's fitness level is the same.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.020]   Not everybody's abilities are the same.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:49.380]   There are some folks, maybe you're a lawyer and you live in Kansas or Iowa, a Midwestern
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:55.620]   state that's not that easy to get around on a bike, and that could open it up to you.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:06.580]   Maybe there are folks out there who aren't that healthy and might have bad knees or physical
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:11.300]   issues that prevent them from pedaling for an hour on a bike.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:18.700]   An electric bike could give you a little bit of fitness but also open you up to decreasing
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:23.740]   your dependence on the car and having more of an active lifestyle.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.380]   I think those things are excellent.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:32.580]   Even for folks who have the bikes that we're talking about, the larger cargo bikes, those
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.620]   are pretty heavy.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:42.980]   If you have a mom that's carrying three kids and groceries in a box, or a dad, it's much
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.040]   easier to have an electric assistant there that would help you out.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.980]   It makes that life transition much easier and, for a lot of people, it's a more sustainable
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:51.980]   option.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.820]   Yeah, I can see that.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.260]   My thing is I'm glad we are getting more options in this country.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:04.300]   Thankfully, these days, I don't have to spend much time in rush hour, but any time I drive
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.940]   down here where I live, it's I-95, it's eight lanes.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.340]   No, actually, it's ten lanes.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.060]   Sometimes I have to drive down to Boca in rush hour.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:20.300]   As I'm cruising along, I look at the tiny number of cars that are in the carpool lane,
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:24.100]   and I look at the massive number of cars that just have one person in it.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.620]   It bothers the engineer in me.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.180]   I just think, "This is so crazy inefficient.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.020]   Why don't we all at least ride motorcycles?"
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.020]   I love to ride motorcycles.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:36.420]   I was thinking, "Listen, you get a nice ... On a motorcycle, what I learned riding a motorcycle,
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.240]   you can get a very nice bike that's very comfortable.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:45.260]   You get yourself a decent, maybe like an aero-stitch suit or something like that that's just on
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.740]   and off to cover up your street clothes, and you can be well-protected in case you go down.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.940]   You can be much more comfortable."
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:58:00.100]   I just think of the money and the gas and the congestion and everything that we could
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:05.580]   save if we built more, if we just chose different options.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.300]   We live in such a car-centric culture that you've got to be pretty counter-cultural to
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   do it.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:15.500]   Well, people have to think outside the box a little bit because what's happening in the
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:25.620]   United States right now is that we have developed in totality for the automobile and for individuals
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:31.620]   to drive cars alone by themselves, going one way.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.620]   We've run out of money.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:38.500]   Basically, the highway trust fund is empty.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.100]   Cities and states cannot sustainably fund their road maintenance on their own, so they're
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.140]   looking for federal grants.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.600]   The federal grants have run out.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.820]   As a country, we don't have a way to pay for that anymore.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:58.660]   The gas tax hasn't increased since the '90s, and inflation has increased, but now all the
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:05.140]   other costs have gone up, and we haven't funded that adequately.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.180]   What happens in that case?
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.260]   They rob other pots of money.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.700]   The extra money that is needed for road maintenance on a national scale comes out of the general
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.540]   fund.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:25.860]   Instead of that money going towards healthcare or education, now it's going towards roads.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.980]   The folks who live in this country will have to make a decision on whether that's a worthwhile
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.700]   investment to them.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:39.100]   Personally, I think we could use the money a little bit better because obesity being
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:44.860]   such an epidemic in the United States, doing something that's active is beneficial.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:49.900]   If you can also make that transportation, wow, you've killed two or three things with
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:58.500]   one stone now that maybe if a kid rides a bike to school, he or she gets to school more
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.900]   alert and awake, ready to learn.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:07.340]   They've already done physical activity, and they haven't caused the damage to the road
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.700]   that a vehicle would.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:19.580]   If you expand your conception of transportation, if you expand that concept out, it can really
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.700]   affect other areas of life in really positive or negative ways.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.060]   I'm with you.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.060]   It's funny.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:33.100]   I'm so interested in education, and there are only a few things that I've seen at least
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.980]   research on that seem to actually make a difference in how well children learn.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:44.100]   One of them is parental involvement, but one of the other ones is physical activity, is
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.500]   that the brain, when there's more physical activity, then the brain is more receptive
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.540]   and the person is able to learn more.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:58.220]   But as you see budgets cut, one of the things that you see going is PE and physical time.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.300]   I just think, why don't you scrap half of the academic classes and fill one of them
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.540]   with just total play, fill the next one with maybe some structured physical activity and
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.780]   structured games, and fill the third one with, I don't know, shop class or something, and
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.300]   you'll get better results in the three or four academic periods that you still maintain
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.820]   than you're getting with the six or seven that you're doing on a daily basis.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:28.260]   If you're an adult, too, if you work for a larger corporation that has a more global
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:34.220]   footprint, a lot of them have a benefit for you to ride your bike to work, and they'll
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:38.060]   actually pay you to ride a bike to work.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.460]   In the United States, a parking spot costs approximately $40,000.
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:48.220]   So if they can save providing parking for you, then they'll turn around and give you
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.540]   some of that money back, and that will help soften the cost of getting involved in this.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.180]   But employers, they realize that, too.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.620]   Employers want their employees to be physically active and to show up.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.940]   They've also found that by paying people to ride their bike to work, they've seen their
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:09.620]   health care premiums go down over the whole corporation because now people are more active
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.620]   and fit.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.660]   So the company is saving money.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:18.180]   It's really a benefit, whether you're young or old.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.180]   Wow.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.180]   Very cool.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.420]   Well, keep up your work, and it sounds like you guys are at least leading as an example,
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.380]   and I hope that more people follow.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.300]   I think that's awesome.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.460]   So anything you want to add as we go?
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.700]   No, I'm good.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.780]   I think it was a great conversation, and I'm hoping folks find it useful.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   Very cool.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.180]   Well, Christopher, thank you so much for coming on the show.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.620]   I really appreciate it.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.660]   Yeah, thank you, Joshua.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.380]   I don't know about you, but for me, I figure if somebody can ride a bike in Colorado or
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:03:00.220]   in North Dakota or in Portland, I don't have much of an excuse down here in sunny South
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.220]   Florida.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:05.540]   Thankfully, I've designed my life that I just don't really spend that much time driving
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.660]   anymore, and I'm making progress on that.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.060]   But still, I don't have any excuse, and neither of us has an excuse.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.060]   So take that.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.580]   I hope you find the information helpful and inspirational.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.460]   Check out the show notes for a link to a couple of articles on Christopher and his family.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.460]   He's a pretty neat guy, and he hosts a—I don't think he mentioned it on the show, but
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:28.300]   he hosts, I think, some kind of weekly show on bicycling on a podcast or a local radio
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.180]   station where he lives.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   So check that out.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.180]   I'll put links to that in the show notes.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.180]   That's it for today's show.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.180]   As we go out here, I thank you all for your reviews.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.180]   If you've enjoyed the content, please give it a thumbs up.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.180]   If you're new here, I thank you all for your reviews.

[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.180]   There's lots of details on that, but that's how I've designed to pay the bills.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.700]   I really appreciate those of you who have signed up.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.460]   It means the world to me of your place and your trust and confidence in me.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.980]   I really appreciate that.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.580]   I also thank you for your reviews on iTunes and Stitcher.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.240]   I'll read one review as we go out the door here.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.920]   This review comes in from Dale and it says on iTunes, "The subject is informative and
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.280]   easy to listen to.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.160]   Joshua is very well spoken, making this podcast very easy to listen to.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.600]   The content contains very detailed facts and advice.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.840]   I like that he doesn't generalize and recommend to everyone to do the same thing.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.120]   He always points out that everyone's decision is dependent upon their personal circumstances,
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.360]   and then he goes into the detail behind what circumstances are appropriate for each option,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.720]   giving us the necessary information to make our own decisions.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.880]   Everyone's very well educated about the topics he covers and doesn't hesitate to let us know
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.880]   when he's not as well informed about a topic that his guest is describing rather than fake
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880]   it.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.800]   He does tend to be a bit long-winded, as I am kind of being here, but that's only because
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.600]   he has so much useful information to share.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   Great podcast.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   Dale, thank you.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.440]   That's a very generous review.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.280]   I don't know how long today's show is, but I don't think it's as long-winded.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.240]   So in the case of the goal of not being long-winded, I'm done for the day.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   Peace out, y'all.

[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:10.640]   Your situation is unique, and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   about you.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:19.240]   This show is not and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:34.240]   trustworthy, and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person,
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   and I make mistakes.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment,
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   so we can all learn together.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.240]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
