[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:12.840]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   a show where you, the audience, provides the questions,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.580]   we try to provide the answers.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.160]   Duncan tries to provide stock picks
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.760]   that you can then go short in your brokerage account.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720]   - Fair. - Fair enough.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.760]   - Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.600]   A lot of wonderful questions again.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.440]   Bonds continue to rule the day.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.640]   We haven't got a question about the stock market in months.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.680]   It's all bonds and taxes and Roth IRAs.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.440]   Today's show is sponsored by Kaplan-Schweizer.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.240]   Sean, our research analyst,
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.400]   just took this-- - Set it right.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   - I got it.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.240]   Sean, our research analyst, just took level one for CFA.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.840]   He asked, before he took it,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040]   "What do I do to pass this test?"
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.800]   I said, "Take as many practice tests as you can
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.600]   "and then get the study guides from Kaplan,"
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.540]   because that's what I did.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.600]   I took the, not to brag,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940]   I have my, I'm a chartered financial analyst,
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.200]   Ben Carlson, comma, CFA.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   Do I have that on LinkedIn?
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.860]   Maybe.
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.920]   I don't know.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   I haven't looked at it in a while.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.760]   But Kaplan makes it easy
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.560]   because the test books for the CFA prep are no joke.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.400]   They're huge.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800]   They don't have a lot of questions in them,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   at least when I took it.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.080]   So I, for the first one, didn't use the books.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   For the second one and the third one,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.360]   I used Kaplan because it made it easier for test prep.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.960]   They bullet point stuff for you.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   They summarize it.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800]   They make it easier.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.720]   And I think you just have to take as many as you can.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.880]   It's a tough test and there's very low pass rates.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.500]   You have to do anything you can to get better.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.060]   $300 minimum they recommend
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.700]   for studying for the CFA test, Duncan.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.260]   It's no joke. - Sounds like a lot.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.100]   - It is a lot.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.920]   So go to the link. - I was reading
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.760]   some of their materials.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.260]   I was reading about the portfolio perspective.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.220]   I was looking at some practice questions.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.060]   - It's tough.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300]   Go to our link on YouTube and you can check it out.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.860]   You can save 10% on their exam test prep stuff right now.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.720]   All right, let's do a question.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.740]   - Okay. - Also,
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.100]   we have a lot of people emailing in with the CFA.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.260]   We had a portfolio manager email today saying,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.300]   hey, listen, I know taking the CFA
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.140]   is not necessarily gonna make you a better investor,
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.000]   but it shows your dedication to the craft.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.700]   And if you wanna be a portfolio manager like me,
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   that's what I'm looking for.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.260]   So this guy said he's only hiring CFA people.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.060]   - Okay, I mean, it makes sense.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.980]   - Sorry, Duncan, you're out.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.220]   - One day.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.060]   - All right.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.900]   - Maybe we'll do an episode
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.220]   where I just take a CFA practice test
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.780]   and everyone can just laugh at me.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.300]   - All right, that's fair.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.380]   - All right. - Bye.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.500]   - Up first today, we have,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.880]   not to brag, but I'm 38, make $50,000 a year
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840]   and have $10,000 in Marcus, $10,000 in a Roth IRA,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.360]   $10,000 in crypto and $10,000 in a traditional 401k.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.680]   I have six months of savings I don't touch.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.040]   My net worth is about $50,000.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.440]   My annual expenses are $40,000
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.320]   and I can typically save $500 a month.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.240]   I live in LA with my partner
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.140]   and work as a resident services coordinator
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.480]   for an affordable housing organization.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.120]   What advice do you have for lower income folks
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   who want to be financially stable?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   My point of view is that I have such a small amount of money
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.280]   but it doesn't really matter
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   because my amount of time to compound is relatively short
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.500]   and my available monthly investment is low.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.280]   Should I just spend my money
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.360]   because the reward of compounding takes longer than I have?
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   I'm not competitive in the labor market.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.340]   I graduated from Arizona State, LOL.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.180]   I don't know what that means.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.020]   I thought Arizona State was fired.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.840]   - That's fired.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.200]   - Yeah, taken down the alma mater
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   and getting an MBA is in the cards.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.640]   - All right, first of all,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.840]   I believe Arizona State was the number one party school
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.100]   for like 20 years in a row.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.560]   So you probably had fun at college.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.600]   - See, don't say that.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.720]   If you didn't, I wouldn't have known that, you know.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.400]   - Looks like a great, you could hike the mountains,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.300]   nice weather, fine.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.560]   But here, don't sell yourself.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.000]   Also, I think he put just kidding after the not to brag.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.280]   - Oh yeah, I took that out
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800]   because I thought it was kind of obvious
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   because they, yeah, they may go on to say lower income.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.580]   - I think Michael here is selling himself short though.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.600]   He lives in California,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   an exceedingly expensive place to live
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.280]   on a lower than median income.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   And he still saves $500 a month.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.240]   He has, he equals his annual salary and net worth.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.880]   And he has a six month emergency fund,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   which I think didn't make it out of here, right?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   So he said he has six months of his savings locked in
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.860]   and didn't touch it.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.800]   A lot of times we get these questions
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   and we cut some of the fat off.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   But so he's not even 40.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.680]   So I say this is more impressive than it sounds, right?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.920]   He also says he doesn't have enough time
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.900]   to allow compounding to work.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.100]   I don't think that's true.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.980]   I call BS on this.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.300]   He's not even 40 yet, right?
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.060]   I think people often underestimate the power of compounding
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.500]   over the short run because you save a little bit of money
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.740]   and you think, oh, I have a little bit of money
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.940]   at the end of the year, right?
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.380]   I still think $500 a month is fine.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.700]   You have plenty of time.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.180]   I went through a bunch of examples here
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.780]   to show how, where he is now
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.020]   and where he can be in the future.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.060]   So right now, $50,000 saved.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.200]   He puts away $6,000 a year.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.060]   Assuming we grow that 50K at 6% per year
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.160]   and then increase the savings rate by 3% a year
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.000]   to account for inflation,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.280]   which is not as much money as you think.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.760]   Going from 6,000 at 3%, it's like 180 bucks in year one.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.440]   Total, not per month.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.360]   John, do the chart on this.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400]   This is what it'll look like at first.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.440]   If he pushes back retirement to 70,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.900]   we're talking about $1.2 million,
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.360]   using again a 6% annual return, which is not bad,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   which is pretty conservative.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   By 65, he'd have $822,000.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.400]   So this is not bad, right?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.440]   Just keep on the same track.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.380]   Obviously, there's a lot of assumptions
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.180]   based into this analysis, baked into it.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.060]   Like if you stay on the same track
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.700]   and you're doing alignment compounding,
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.340]   the world doesn't work like this in a nice curve,
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.600]   like a spreadsheet, but just, you know,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.440]   take this word for word.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.740]   You're not in that bad of a position
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.780]   if you just have a multi-decade view.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.220]   However, I think we can do better than this, right?
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.820]   This is my campaign speech here.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.460]   First, let's look at a little more frugality.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.700]   He's obviously already cutting back,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.460]   but let's say you just save an extra 25 bucks a month.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.800]   A month, right?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.720]   You don't go out to eat, you save a little bit more.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.040]   This is on top of the current assumptions.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.920]   That's $300 more in savings each year,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.400]   on top of what you're already saving.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.560]   Now by age 65, we're talking $1.5 million by age 70,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.360]   or roughly 1 million by age 65.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.960]   You can do a chart off, John.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.760]   So these small changes can have a big impact
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.520]   over multi-decade time horizons, right?
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.880]   However, one of the ugly secrets of personal finance,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.240]   frugality can only take you so far,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.640]   especially when you're on a lower income, right?
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.300]   I think having a higher income and getting a raise
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.420]   or negotiating a higher salary
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.740]   is one of the biggest levers you can pull
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.300]   if you want to improve your personal finance.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.420]   And maybe he's happy with this job,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.540]   but I think now is the perfect time
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.820]   to explore your options, at least,
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.040]   in this tight labor market.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.400]   Pull up the Fed chart here, John.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.100]   This is Fed data on wage growth numbers
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.820]   broken up by job switchers and job stayers.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.580]   Look at that spike for people who switched jobs.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.320]   Since the start of 2022, people who've switched jobs
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.060]   are averaging 7% annual wage growth, okay, annualized,
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.320]   versus people who stayed at their job
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.480]   are averaging 5% annual wage growth.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.520]   This doesn't take into account inflation,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.400]   but look at that spike for people who switched jobs.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.000]   If you ever wanted to test the waters
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.640]   to see what your value is in the labor force,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.680]   now is the time to do it.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.820]   And I think a single raise early in your career
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.800]   can have a massive impact on your finances
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.400]   if you save over time.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.980]   So let's say now you find a new job
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.000]   that pays you $10,000 more per year,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.080]   and you save like a third of it.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.560]   Call it $3,500.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.480]   Every year you save a third of that raise, right?
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   Every single year.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.420]   That raise could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.260]   to you.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.220]   So let's say you save a third of that raise.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.740]   We're still doing the, adding that on top of your 6,000,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.140]   you're already saving per year,
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940]   and then increase it by 3% for inflation.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.460]   John, do the next chart on.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.200]   Now by 70, we're talking $1.7 million.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.720]   Again, pretty conservative 6% growth here.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.780]   By age 65, we're looking at $1.1 million
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.740]   for a one $10,000 raise, right?
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.500]   And it assumes you just have your cost of living increases
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.340]   thereafter.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.240]   Again, not bad, right?
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.160]   Now, one step further.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.340]   Let's say if we combine these two strategies.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.540]   You increase your saving a little bit,
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.580]   25 bucks per month each year, add that 25,
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.980]   and you get a $10,000 raise.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.460]   All right, John, now let's look at it.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.940]   $2.2 million by the time you are 70.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.700]   1.4 million by 65.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.500]   So those two levers you pull,
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.580]   you get one pretty decent size raise right now.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.020]   You also save a little bit more money each year.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.460]   We're talking about adding a million dollars
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.860]   to your bottom line by age 70,
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.100]   if you push back retirement that long.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   Obviously, again, life never works out like this.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.600]   It's easy on a retirement calculator or spreadsheet.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.940]   Some years you'll be able to save more,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.620]   some years you'll be able to save less.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.960]   Your career trajectory may work out better than you think.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.560]   I think if you test the waters a little bit,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.980]   you might be surprised what you can find right now.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.260]   It could be worse, you never know.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.040]   Investment returns might come in higher than 6%.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880]   It might come in lower.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.900]   I think that's why financial planning
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.580]   is a process and not an event.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.860]   The main takeaway here, though,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.300]   how do you save on a lower income?
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.940]   It's the same way you save if you have a higher income.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.380]   You live on less than you earn.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.340]   You automate your savings.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.220]   You increase your savings rate a little bit each year.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.700]   You save more, a little bit more money each year,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.820]   and you increase your earning potential
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.460]   because that's the biggest lever you can pull.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.740]   The good news is for Michael here
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.060]   is that he already knows how to save.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.420]   He lives in California and he's still able
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.060]   to save 500 bucks a month
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.660]   on a relatively low salary for there.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.780]   I think there are ways to improve your situation
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.980]   if you're willing to work on your career a little bit.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.560]   And I don't think you necessarily need
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.140]   to have an MBA to do so these days
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.220]   'cause the labor market is so tight.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.660]   So Ramit at I Will Teach You To Be Rich
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.700]   has these jobs on finding your dream job
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.680]   or starting a side hustle or negotiating a higher salary,
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.360]   which is much cheaper than an MBA,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.980]   something you can kind of try on the side.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.260]   I don't know how happy you are with your job,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.900]   but now is the time to try something, I think,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.660]   because it can't hurt to try to look
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.780]   and see if there's something better out there
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.060]   to try to earn a little bit more money by switching jobs.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.300]   - Yeah, and like you say, just asking,
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.500]   just asking for more sometimes, right?
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.900]   I mean, sometimes-- - No one wants
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.260]   to have that conversation, but yes,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.500]   having uncomfortable conversations like that,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.340]   the worst they can do is say no, right?
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.700]   But I think this is the time in a tight labor market
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.540]   where you can get out there and see how much you're worth.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.340]   And again, if he just goes from 50 to 60
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.940]   or 50 to 65 or 70 and he continues to save
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.460]   the way he's saving with that savings rate,
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.180]   don't YOLO everything now, you're doing fine.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.900]   Keep it up. - Yeah, and don't discount
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.100]   how much the hiring process sucks, right?
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.620]   Companies don't wanna lose someone,
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.420]   organizations don't wanna lose someone
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.820]   to then just have to hire someone
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.980]   that they're gonna have to pay
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.380]   whatever you were asking for to begin with.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.540]   So yeah, I think that he has some options.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.020]   - He's not gonna get hired as like a career counselor
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.220]   at Arizona State now that he mocked going there, but--
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.500]   - Probably not, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.060]   - But yeah, all is not lost.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.140]   You're still in a pretty good position here.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.100]   Just keep up what you're doing
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.180]   and try to improve yourself a little bit.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.580]   I think you could, I think you'll be fine.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.100]   - Are they the Sun Devils?
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.940]   Is that the Sun Devils? - Yes.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.760]   - Okay. - You got it.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.600]   My brother went there for a year.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.580]   - Okay, okay. - Good school, right?
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.420]   - Yeah, I agree though.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.940]   I think Michael's being a little too hard on himself.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.180]   I know that not to brag was a joke,
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.980]   but I mean, I don't think they've done a bad job.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.960]   - I am much more impressed by someone on a lower income
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.020]   being able to save that much and put away money
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.380]   than someone at a higher income.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.380]   - Right.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.860]   - All right, next question.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.340]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Matthew.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.580]   I'm 42, I live in Italy and max out my 401k.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.360]   Well, the Italian equivalent.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.020]   I'm single and my savings are one year of expenses
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   in cash and the rest in a world stock ETF.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.340]   I'm almost done with my mortgage,
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.260]   so I earn 80% of my house.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.100]   About my salary, I choose to get a monthly payment
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.480]   that just pays my expenses and a lump sum
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.780]   once a year in May.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.500]   Wonder what kind of job or work that is.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.700]   - Yeah, that is interesting.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.180]   - Every year I invest the lump sum all at once.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.620]   I ran some data and it looks like
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.860]   I should invest this lump sum every September
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.700]   because it's historically the worst month for the market.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.940]   Does this make sense?
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.500]   Trying to buy cheap, right?
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.460]   All right, I wonder what the Italian 401k is called.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.060]   All right, I've yet to read a good theory
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.860]   on seasonality thing, but it is true.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.960]   John, do a chart on here.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.620]   I looked at this, the average returns in the S&P 500
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.340]   by month, going back to 1926.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.180]   Every month is positive on average besides September,
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.420]   which is down close to 90 basis points on average.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.260]   And what are your thoughts?
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.560]   A couple of weeks ago, Josh did speculate
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.180]   that it's people getting sad because summer's over.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.820]   I think there might be some credence to that,
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.640]   but I don't know.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.260]   It's still pretty warm here in September.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.740]   I actually think maybe just coming back from the,
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.580]   all the traders coming back
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.860]   from their beach houses at the Hamptons.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.940]   I did dig into this a little more.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.700]   63% of all months have been positive historically,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.180]   meaning 37% of the time you get a down month,
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.740]   going back almost a hundred years.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.780]   In September, it's more like 50/50, almost exactly.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.580]   Half the months are positive, half the months are negative.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.900]   There's been 27 double-digit down months historically
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.100]   for the S&P 500 in the U.S. stock market.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.020]   Seven of those have occurred in September.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.900]   Now it is worth noting,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.180]   four of those seven occurred in the '30s.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.740]   But even if we take the '30s out of the equation,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.780]   I think if you start in 1950,
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.220]   September's still down on average.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.380]   2008 was a big one as well.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.380]   The stock market has been down
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.220]   now the past four Septembers in a row.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.860]   So I don't know if this is like a self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.920]   or what.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.020]   As far as I'm concerned though,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.940]   this falls under interesting, not actionable.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   Because, I don't know, why does this,
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.540]   I think this is just,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.100]   I think this is honestly just something that happens.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.460]   I think this is like,
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.680]   people look at this in a hundred years and it didn't follow,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.000]   and you try to follow some September.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.840]   What is it?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.660]   I don't know.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.500]   Buy in May and go away.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.820]   - If you were a betting man,
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.340]   would you bet on September
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.140]   being the cheaper month to buy stocks?
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.060]   - See, I think there's a sell in May and go away,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.720]   but there's no buy in September
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.060]   because it'll be something to remember.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.460]   It doesn't rhyme very well.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.380]   Here's the thing.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.820]   You get paid in May.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.500]   On average, stocks are up in May, June, July, and August.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.260]   Stocks are up three out of every four years on average.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.140]   Don't overthink it.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.300]   It's really gonna matter what month
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.240]   you put your money to work in three to four decades
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.480]   into the future.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.320]   I don't know.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.200]   I guess if you want to get cute with it,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.720]   fine, wait till September.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.340]   But what's the point?
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.960]   I mean, if you're investing in a lump sum,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   I don't think you try to nail it perfectly.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.080]   I think most of the time you'll be better off
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.760]   if you just put the money to work right away
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   and not try to game the system.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.680]   - Yeah, I was thinking all this data
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.920]   makes it seem like, yeah,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.520]   what they're saying is a no-brainer, right?
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.280]   But then, yeah, you just kind of, I guess,
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.460]   made the point that matters more,
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.400]   which is you're missing out on several months
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.800]   of the market being up to then buy
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.360]   in a month where it's down, yeah.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.920]   - We actually got another question.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.360]   Someone asked, "What's the best day of the week to buy?"
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.880]   Now, I didn't want to go that far into it,
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.280]   but I think you're getting that nitty gritty about it.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.960]   Just it's too much minutiae and detail.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.180]   - There is, I mean, there is truth to,
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.840]   what is it, people sell on Fridays
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.680]   because they don't want to hold things over the weekend?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   Like traders, right?
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.880]   Isn't there some truth to that?
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.720]   - I don't know.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.560]   People always say the stock market
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.520]   never bottoms on a Friday.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   I don't know.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.400]   I think these things are old wives' tales
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.640]   and they just sound good
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.880]   because traders have been saying them for years.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.060]   I don't know if they're actually true.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.520]   - We should come up with our own,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.440]   like a good saying that we can just spread out there.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.680]   - My brother used to tell me,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.920]   I think you should buy on Thursdays
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.480]   'cause people in their 401(k) get paid
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   and put the money in on Friday.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.360]   And I don't know, it's just--
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.520]   - Ah, look at that.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.200]   - I think you're never gonna gain the system that way.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.100]   If that sort of thing did exist,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.880]   Jim Simons would arbitrage it out of existence.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.240]   - Maybe that is what he's doing, though.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.280]   We don't really know what's happening
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.720]   inside that portfolio, right?
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.920]   Let's do another bond one.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.440]   - All right, up next we have a question from Alex.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.160]   Ben, you've mentioned quite a few times
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.600]   that when buying treasuries,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.320]   we can more or less expect the return
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120]   to match the original yield.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.200]   Is that true for corporate bonds as well?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.360]   Would something like LQD be a more or less safe way
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.320]   to expect around 5% return over the next five to 10 years?
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.580]   - Great question because I've never really looked
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.800]   at this before for corporate bonds.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.200]   Expect returns in the stock market
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.480]   are basically impossible to pin down
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.380]   because you could have all the fundamentals you want
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.760]   of earnings and sales and cash flows
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.960]   and slap a ratio on them or a multiple,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.320]   but throw those fundamentals out the window
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.100]   if people are willing to pay more or less for stocks.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.960]   That's all that really matters,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.780]   how much are people willing to pay at that time.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.720]   But expect returns for bonds are based on math.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.940]   So John, do a chart on the first one.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.440]   This is five-year treasuries.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.280]   This is what we're talking about.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.580]   And the question here from Alex,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.960]   this shows the red dotted line is the starting yield.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.880]   The black line shows a forward five-year return.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.720]   It tracked pretty closely.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.140]   I think the correlation is like 0.95
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.940]   for all you people who aren't math nerds.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.020]   That's a really strong correlation means
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.100]   these have a very strong relationship together.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.940]   I've also done this with 10-year bonds in the past.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.240]   It's a similar story.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.900]   I've never actually run the numbers on corporates,
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.740]   but this is how it was explained to me early in my career.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.540]   Like future bond returns of anything
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.940]   are just the yield minus anything that goes wrong,
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.780]   like a default.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.760]   So you don't have to worry about defaults for treasuries
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   because the U.S. government can literally print money
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.300]   anytime they want, but for bonds, you do.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.760]   But bond defaults are pretty small, actually.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.020]   High yield bonds, we're talking something
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.920]   like two to 5% historically, I think.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.760]   So take whatever that bond yield is
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.260]   and shave a little bit off because of that risk of default.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.300]   According to Charles Schwab,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.560]   investment grade bond default rate was 0%
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.480]   in 14 of the years from 2001 to 2022.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.020]   It's because we have all these zombie companies
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.840]   walking around, right, Duncan?
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.920]   The highest default rate was less than 1% in 2008
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.360]   during the global financial crisis, so not too bad.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   Investment grade corporate bonds
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.200]   don't default all that often.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.480]   Now that's out of the way, let's do some charts.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.880]   First one from Bank of America
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.560]   looks at total returns versus yield.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.640]   This is only over 12 months,
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.900]   so I'm not a really big fan of this,
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.200]   but it's pretty close, not too bad.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.400]   They line up okay, but in one-year periods,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.380]   you're gonna get more volatility
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.260]   because rates can move and inflation can move
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.960]   and economic growth expectations.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.280]   I also looked at corporate bond,
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.720]   long-term corporates going back to 1926,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.080]   forward 10-year returns.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.040]   That's a pretty good line, right?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.660]   It's not a perfect fit, but it's not bad.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.760]   I think the correlation I found is 0.9
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.840]   between starting yields for longer-term corporate bonds
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.280]   and forward 10-year returns.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.480]   I looked this morning,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   investment grade corporates are yielding around 6%,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.600]   so yeah, that's a pretty good estimate
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.440]   for returns going forward from here for corporate bonds.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.460]   The only thing I would caution
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.600]   if you're investing in these corporate bonds
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.480]   is during a recession,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.680]   these bonds tend to get hit way harder
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.380]   and have a higher potential for drawdowns
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   when we do go into recession.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.320]   People sell their corporates,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.280]   they have a flight to safety going to treasuries.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.240]   I don't know if that'll happen this time,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.040]   but that's what's happened historically.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.920]   Not bad though, right?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.120]   6%, you can kind of bank on it going forward,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.920]   I don't know, five, seven years in the future or so.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.640]   - 6% is pretty good.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.920]   - Yeah, I used to mess around with the junk bond ETF,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.360]   you know, that was more my style.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.760]   - Triple levered junk bond ETF?
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.840]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.240]   - It's like JNKZ maybe?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.720]   I don't know if they have that, but.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.600]   - Only companies that have gone bankrupt.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.440]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   All right, so not bad.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.420]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.700]   But yeah, that's, it makes sense intuitively
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.940]   and it makes sense historically as well.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.060]   - Cool, I like it.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.580]   Okay, question four.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.180]   Question from Justin.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.580]   My wife and I, 22% tax bracket in Pennsylvania,
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.100]   recently had our first child.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.420]   - I love it how people always share
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.500]   their tax bracket with us.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.980]   - I do like that, yeah, yeah, it's kind of like.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.820]   - It's kind of funny.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.060]   - It's one of the shows that shares like weight
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.500]   or like measurements or something.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.620]   - Yeah, and we're tax brackets.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.740]   - Yeah.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.580]   My wife and I recently had our first child.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.540]   Unfortunately, the birth was complicated,
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.340]   resulting in a brain injury.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.700]   Due to the nature of this injury,
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.420]   the range of outcomes is wide,
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.980]   anywhere from minimal impacts to requiring special care.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.740]   We will not know until later in life
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.060]   what the developmental impacts are,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.920]   even up until school age.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.380]   My initial thought before this was to put money
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.000]   in the Pennsylvania 529 plan.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.860]   Now, due to the uncertainty,
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.420]   I no longer think this is the right course of action.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.780]   My thought is to put this money into a brokerage account
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.860]   and assign it to a more optimized vehicle
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.300]   when more is known.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.820]   We are also considering contributing more to our HSA
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.900]   due to anticipated increasing healthcare costs.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.180]   Does this make sense?
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.560]   Are there other vehicles to consider
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.940]   for an 18 year time horizon?
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.020]   So, sorry to hear if this is a sad one.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.960]   - One of the strange things about being a financial advisor
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.200]   is that sometimes you're called upon
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.020]   during like life's tough situations,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.080]   like death, divorce, medical issues,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   and it almost feels wrong to think about finances
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.700]   in a situation like this because you're dealing
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.020]   with so many other things on a personal level,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.760]   but I'm happy that he's at least thinking about this
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.060]   'cause you don't want it to be a situation
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.900]   where down the road,
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.380]   since there are a wide range of results,
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.060]   that you're surprised down the line.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.120]   So, let's bring in an expert from financial advice
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.300]   to help us with this.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.860]   Financial advisor extraordinaire with us, Kevin Young.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.340]   - Hey Kevin, how's it going? - Kevin, how's it going?
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.400]   - Great.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.900]   - So, my initial thought here would have been an HSA.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.340]   It sounds like that's already been thought of.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.020]   Is there anything else to think about here?
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.680]   Like some sort of trust, any other sort of insurance?
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.720]   What else can we assume here that would make sense
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.900]   to cover your rear end on something like this?
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:20.040]   So, this is a great question and it's close to my heart.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.840]   My seven-year-old Jack has pretty severe special needs.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.960]   He was born with a very rare genetic condition.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.600]   And so, I have walked in your shoes, Justin.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   It's not easy, but you'll get through it.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.240]   And some of the things you can do
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.920]   to put yourself in a good position,
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.800]   you're already thinking about.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.040]   An HSA is a great idea, maxing that out.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.280]   Because even if the effects are minimal,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.880]   which we hope is the case, being a parent,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.160]   you're gonna have medical expenses over and above
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.300]   what your healthcare is gonna look like.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.080]   Your deductibles aren't gonna, are gonna be higher.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.400]   Whatever the case, HSA is always a great plan.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.680]   - Yeah, with kids, even if there's not
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.960]   some sort of special issue,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.500]   there's a lot of trips to the doctor.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.480]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.800]   And the other thing you can start to think about
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.160]   a little bit is a lot of states,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.100]   Pennsylvania being one of them,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.300]   has what's called an ABLE account.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.440]   And an ABLE account, A-B-L-E,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.120]   is a part of the 529 section of the tax code.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.940]   And what it's designed for is, unlike a typical 529
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.140]   where people put money in and it's used
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.700]   for higher education expenses,
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.220]   an ABLE account is used for medical expenses
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.620]   for people with disabilities.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.940]   And the great thing about it is it functions very similarly.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.680]   You put money in.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.620]   The state of Pennsylvania is actually one of the best
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.500]   because you can get a tax deduction up to $17,000, which is--
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.740]   - How many states have the availability for this account?
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.220]   - A lot of states have the availability for the account,
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.080]   but I don't, there might be one or two others
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.500]   that actually offer you a deduction.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.180]   Pennsylvania is actually the best one I've seen.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.020]   Unfortunately, it's only for Pennsylvania residents,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.380]   otherwise I would have one.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.340]   - Yeah.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.960]   - So what's great about it is similar to that regular 529,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.500]   you get the deduction up front.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.380]   The money is gonna grow tax deferred.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.460]   And if, when you take it out,
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.740]   if it is used for a qualified expense,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.620]   which in this scenario could be anything,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.700]   assistive technology devices, medical appointments,
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.180]   you know, changes to the home because you need a ramp
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.300]   or you need, you know, special equipment in the house,
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.540]   anything like that can be paid for with this.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.500]   - So it works kind of like an HSA a little bit.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.720]   - It's very similar to an HSA.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.940]   And the other great thing is if these, you know,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.060]   if the problems are a little bit more substantial
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.940]   and there's a path down the road
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.400]   to be getting benefits from the state,
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.580]   an ABLE account will not mess with your ability
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.940]   to get those benefits.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.860]   So they do not, even though the assets are for your child,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.820]   the state will not look at those assets
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.380]   at something that would reduce their benefits
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.380]   either now or way down the road.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.800]   So I'd encourage you to check out,
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.920]   I was on the Pennsylvania site yesterday,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.260]   checking into this.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.500]   It's a really good resource.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.780]   So I'd highly encourage you to check that out.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.500]   The other thing here to note,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.900]   because you don't know what this is gonna look like yet.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.840]   And that was the way that we were.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.740]   We still have some questions
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.060]   about how Jack is gonna be ultimately,
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.820]   but it's very different than what we imagined in good ways.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.820]   But you can always roll over from a regular 529 plan
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   into a ABLE 529.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.860]   So if you wanted to make those contributions
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.100]   to the regular 529 today,
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.620]   and then three, four years from now,
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.700]   you realize, okay,
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.420]   maybe college isn't gonna be the answer here.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.740]   You can roll over up to the gift amount,
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.160]   which is 17,000 this year,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.520]   you can roll that into the ABLE account.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.400]   - Wow, okay, so there's a lot of options here.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.000]   This is way more than I,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.880]   I'm not really familiar with this ABLE account.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.440]   So he has some good options here
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   that sounds like they're pretty flexible as well.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   - Yeah, yeah, they're really flexible.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.280]   They're gonna give you a similar breakdown
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.160]   of investment options as well.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.800]   And I think Pennsylvania,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.120]   you can have up to $100,000 in the account
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.160]   before they start to ding you for benefits.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.960]   The really cool thing about Pennsylvania too
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   is they've got a link where you could,
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.600]   you can send it to somebody if somebody says,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.720]   "Hey, what should we get the baby for a gift?"
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.680]   There's a link that'll go right to the account.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.760]   And so if they wanna contribute money
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   as a gift or anything like that,
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   they can do that as well.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.100]   So it's great.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.940]   - That's awesome.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.780]   That's good to hear.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.320]   So Justin actually asked another follow up question
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.160]   about his wife.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.060]   So why don't we come on again.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:46.960]   Here's another one.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.400]   - Okay, my wife is a teacher
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.980]   and is enrolled in the Teacher's State Pension Plan.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.960]   The payout is a formula based on average salary,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.020]   years of service, and a multiplier.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.420]   This is quite difficult to forecast for many reasons,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.920]   including how long my wife will want to work,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.420]   average salary, 25 years in the future,
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.240]   when you can withdraw without penalty,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.060]   and the solvency of the plan.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.100]   My question is how we should be thinking
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.840]   about this pension plan.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.400]   We have access to several options,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.180]   401(k), Roth 401(k), 403(b), Roth 403(b).
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.840]   Should we consider this plan icing on the cake?
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   After 30 years in the plan,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.800]   my wife would be around 62 or 63.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.240]   Perhaps it would be good to push more money into a Roth
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.440]   to have more flexibility if she wanted to retire a bit early.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.860]   Looking for some general thoughts on this situation.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.900]   - So one of the joys of financial planning
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.200]   is like a never ending stream of unknowns.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.080]   And this is the kind of thing too,
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.000]   where you want to be able to bank on a pension being there.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   We actually get a lot of questions from people saying,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.400]   listen, I'm in this state
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.440]   and I don't trust the government
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.760]   'cause they're spending too much money.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.360]   And I'm worried my pension's not even gonna be there.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.600]   So I think they're thinking about it similarly
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.440]   and wondering like,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.840]   are they gonna change the formula on me?
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.400]   Or are they gonna call back some of this stuff
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.240]   that they're promising me
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.280]   because they can't afford it in the future?
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.420]   So how do you think about, especially, I mean,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.440]   it's a little easier if you have someone
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.560]   who's approaching retirement age
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   and they're looking through this
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.000]   because in those situations,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.160]   they're probably gonna be grandfathered
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.000]   and you don't have to worry about it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.880]   How do you approach something like a pension
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.920]   in terms of financial planning?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.440]   Because you have the formulas here.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.440]   And from the math side of things,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.400]   it should be relatively easy.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.520]   You could map out the income,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.420]   you could map out what it's going to be from the pension,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.640]   but people are still worried about this stuff.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   So how do you approach these things?
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.520]   - Yeah, so I think, he used the term icing on the cake.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   I think that's how you think about it.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   I would probably save and invest like it didn't exist
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.800]   if it's 30 years from now.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.880]   Because you just don't wanna put yourself
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.640]   in a position where you're counting on something
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.800]   that doesn't end up happening
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.180]   or happens at 70% of what you had thought it was, et cetera.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.940]   I think pensions are a lot like social security.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.600]   No politician is ever gonna run on reelection
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.640]   on getting rid of or cutting social security.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.200]   Similar to state pensions, right?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.560]   - I was thinking the same way.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.320]   I think a lot of young people in the back of their mind
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.240]   have thought of social,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.540]   they're planning for social security not being there,
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.440]   but I think it's going to be there
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.320]   even if it's diminished in some way.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.160]   Because yeah, you're right.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.120]   No one's gonna take away that benefit in their right mind.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   'Cause a lot of people think that's mine, it's my right.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.640]   I think a lot of people are thinking of it the same way.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.240]   And I agree, it could be diminished a little.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.320]   I don't think it's gonna be, especially for teachers.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.440]   I don't think that pension's not going to be there.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   - Yeah, that's a political landmine, I would think.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.880]   But again, just assuming even for social security
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.720]   in general, right?
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.580]   Like we're living longer, when it was designed,
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.840]   it wasn't designed to sustain
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   a 30 or 40 year retirement, right?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.340]   So things might have to change at some point,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.120]   whether it's social security or a pension,
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.080]   you don't want to rely too much on something,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.520]   even though it's a promise and it's a guarantee.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.760]   It's just not something that you want to fully bank on.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.120]   And so I think if you have the ability to save
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.240]   in different types of accounts, at the 22%,
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.960]   this is the same Justin, right?
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.640]   - Okay, so at the 22%--
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.320]   - Yeah, we already know the tax bracket, right?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.240]   - Yeah, this is really helpful.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.700]   Everybody needs to put their tax bracket in
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.780]   when they email us questions now.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   So at 22%, probably lean towards the Roth
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.380]   just because you're not getting as much bang for the buck
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.220]   on the deferral.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.380]   - Bill's so happy in the chat now.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.820]   - Yep, Bill Sweet would like the fact
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.980]   that you agreed with him there.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.940]   So there's a sweet spot and I only know that
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.960]   because I get to work with Bill Sweet and Bill Artzaronian.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.660]   So you have a lot of other options
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.740]   and I would continue to do that.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.080]   And then hopefully the pension's there in full
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.580]   and that's great.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.020]   - I talked to a family member recently
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.860]   who is reaching retirement age for a teacher,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.700]   I think it's like 55 or something,
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.380]   and was talking about the pension.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.740]   And I said, "Do you realize how much that pension is worth
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.980]   "if you put a present value on it somehow?"
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.020]   That's kind of tricky to do
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.740]   because it deals with discount rates and stuff.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.340]   But she's like, "If you backed the income out
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.800]   "and turned that into what it would be
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.980]   "if you had a lump sum."
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.740]   It's a big amount of money,
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.280]   bigger than most people would realize
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.700]   if they tried to turn that into an annuity or something.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.860]   - Yeah, and in the corporate world,
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   you're starting to see,
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.380]   I've certainly seen it with clients of mine
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.380]   that if they worked someplace 10, 15 years ago
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.660]   and they'd been there for 20 or 30 years
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.860]   and they have a pension,
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.660]   they're getting letters saying,
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.180]   "Hey, we'll buy you out of this right now
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.380]   "and here's the amount we'll give you right now."
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.600]   And you go in and you do the math
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   and you figure out,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.260]   "Well, what would I need to return in the market
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.700]   "to do better than this?"
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.880]   But again, sometimes it's just,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.080]   "Hey, I know we probably could do a little better
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.540]   "in the market over the longterm,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.500]   "but I love the idea of that guaranteed check
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.340]   "coming in every month."
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.260]   - Exactly.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.460]   - Which has meaning.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.740]   - And it's an emotional thing, yeah.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.300]   - Kind of like a basic,
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.060]   maybe nuboil question for you guys,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.120]   but a pension,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.060]   you don't get to select what funds
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.180]   are in there or anything, right?
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.820]   You just have a share of the pie.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.620]   - No, they invest it for you
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.580]   and they have to reach their bogey and yeah.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.660]   - This was on your practice test question
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.380]   before you went live.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.620]   The pension, they bear the risk of the investment.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.780]   - Oh, that's what that meant.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.620]   - That's what that means.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.460]   - Okay, I see.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.500]   All right, one more question.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.460]   - Okay, last but not least,
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.280]   we have a question from Eric and sorry, Kevin,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.740]   we've got the bummer questions for you, but Eric writes,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.660]   yeah, Eric writes,
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.220]   "My father recently passed away
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.400]   "and my 71-year-old mother will be receiving
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.260]   "approximately $800,000 in life insurance proceeds.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.480]   "My mother's level of financial literacy is low.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.400]   "My dad always handled the finances.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   "So I will be in charge of overseeing the management
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.580]   "of the life insurance proceeds.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.840]   "How would you recommend investing these funds?
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.040]   "Their only debt is a mortgage with $200,000 remaining,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.540]   "seven years left at a 3% rate,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.900]   "about a million dollars in equity."
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.260]   So sorry to hear Eric.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.140]   - We've talked in the past
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.180]   about why people get a financial advisor.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.020]   This is one of the reasons,
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.580]   especially a lot of like DIY people come to us.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.140]   They say, listen, I've managed the finances fine myself,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.740]   but I want my loved ones or my spouse to be taken care of.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.540]   I actually have one guy, guy has about $10 million.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.540]   We've met with him a bunch of times over the years.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.260]   And he says, listen, I like doing it on my own.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.820]   I'm gonna continue to do it on my own,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.580]   but I have a letter that's gonna go to my wife.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.860]   Should I pass before she does?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.020]   And it says, call up the folks at Ritholtz
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.100]   and have them take care of you.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.120]   But this is the kind of thing that makes sense.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.300]   So I guess it's probably too simple to tell this guy
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.620]   that his mom needs a financial advisor.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.860]   My only advice here would be just don't be in a hurry
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.900]   because emotions are probably already high.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   Like don't just sit on the money forever,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.780]   but I think take your time
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.860]   and be thoughtful about this decision as well.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.940]   And maybe reach out to a professional for some help.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.500]   - Yeah, we talk about getting rid
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.660]   of a single point of failure in a financial plan.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.620]   And that's what happens
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.740]   when there's a do-it-yourself investor
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.480]   with spouses or children or people
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.280]   that need to be taken care of after that person's gone.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   And it's far more common than not probably.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:03.180]   But for this person, that burden now is on your shoulders.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.180]   So figuring out not only what's best for your mom,
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.820]   but also making sure that you're not taking on too much
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.780]   of a burden for that,
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.740]   that you understand everything that's happened.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.660]   God forbid something happened to you,
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.700]   now we're back to square one.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.420]   - Yeah, someone with low financial literacy.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.860]   I also think the probability for a scam is high here.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.500]   So I'd help your mother find someone.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.060]   Because if we have a million dollars in equity in a home
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.460]   and $800,000 in life insurance,
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.440]   there's probably more money there too.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.940]   She's gonna have a huge target on her back
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.340]   from people who are going to try to take advantage of her.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.780]   So I would help her just make sound financial decisions.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.260]   I don't think, yeah, you need to take over
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.180]   the management of the money.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.500]   I would probably try to find someone to help.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.180]   But I would at least help her make good decisions
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.060]   in terms of who to hire and go through
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.900]   that process with her.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.620]   - It seems like you also have to take into account,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.260]   like Kevin was kind of alluding,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.580]   just how much the stress of having this on your back
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.260]   is worth.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.100]   - It's a lot.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.940]   - Because yeah, if you make a choice
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.860]   that is perceived as wrong down the line,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.740]   you're the guy that lost mom's money,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.300]   like that kind of thing.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.020]   Seems like there's a lot of pressure there.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.140]   - Yeah, and these types of things,
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.580]   you wanna find a good fiduciary advisor
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.340]   that can handle this stuff for you.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.620]   Because yeah, you never want...
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.740]   I don't know if you have siblings
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.740]   or if there's other family members involved
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.420]   that say that there's an investment that goes wrong
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.640]   and now it's your fault.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.140]   Well, that could open you up to liability.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.700]   And these are not fun topics to talk about.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.620]   But you have to think about this stuff.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.020]   And what happens if you're out of the country
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.420]   and mom needs, mom's boiler went,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.100]   she needs $5,000 immediately and you can't do it.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.700]   These are like just little things
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.300]   that where it might make sense to get a professional
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.140]   to help you out with this stuff.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.060]   - Yes, family and money is not something
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.320]   that mixes very well.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.660]   - Sounds like a blast.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.540]   - Yes.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.900]   - But yeah, sorry for your loss here.
