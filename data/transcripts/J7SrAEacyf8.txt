[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.880]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.840]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.840]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.000]   about science and science-related tools.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.300]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.980]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.600]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.400]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.080]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.240]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.880]   I'm a big believer in blood tests and DNA tests
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.660]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.420]   that are important for your short-term and long-term health
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.100]   and overall wellbeing can only be analyzed
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.880]   from blood and DNA tests.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.680]   Things like metabolic factors and hormone levels
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   really can only be assessed accurately from blood and DNA.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.440]   The thing I like about InsideTracker
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320]   is you don't just get back levels of different hormones
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.700]   and metabolic factors and so forth.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.920]   You also get directives.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.240]   It has a dashboard that's very easy to use
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.440]   that tells you, based on your data,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720]   what sorts of foods you might want to eat more of
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.600]   or less of,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560]   what forms of exercise you might want to do more of
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.640]   or less of.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.680]   It's really a wonderful way to assess
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.000]   how your behaviors and lifestyle choices
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060]   are interacting with what's going on
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.160]   deep within your biology.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.680]   InsideTracker makes all of that super easy to understand.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920]   It's also really easy to get the blood tests
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.160]   and DNA tests taken.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.920]   You can go to a local location
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.240]   or they can send somebody to your home if you prefer that.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.760]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.880]   Today's episode is also brought to you by Helix Sleep.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.140]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.640]   that are designed to meet your sleep needs
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.800]   in order to optimize your sleep.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.840]   I've done several episodes of this podcast
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.860]   and there's a ton of information out there
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.880]   pointing to the fact that getting really deep,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.920]   restful sleep each night is vital
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.640]   for mental and physical health.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.780]   And the mattress that you sleep on and the pillow
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.400]   that you use is very important for getting optimal sleep.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.680]   Helix Sleep has a brief two minute quiz that you can take.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.800]   It asks you questions like, do you sleep on your side
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920]   or your back or your stomach, or maybe you don't know,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.240]   do you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.960]   or maybe you don't know.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.980]   That two minute quiz matches you to a mattress and pillow
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.600]   I took this quiz, I matched to the mattress
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.440]   they call the Dusk D-U-S-K
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.740]   and I've been sleeping on the Dusk mattress for many months
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.480]   now and I've been sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.120]   It's really wonderful to have a really good night's sleep
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.900]   on a consistent basis, it's a total game changer.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.760]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.960]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.560]   take their two minute sleep quiz
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.880]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.000]   and you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattress orders
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.560]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.740]   So that's helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.220]   take the two minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.780]   they'll match you to a mattress
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.060]   and if you order one of their mattresses,
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.900]   you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattresses
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.580]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.800]   They have a 10 year warranty
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.440]   and you get to try out the mattress
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.220]   for a hundred nights risk-free
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.060]   and if you don't like it,
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.680]   they'll pick it up and take it away.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.540]   If you love it, then you keep it
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.140]   and I think there's a very good chance
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.320]   that you're going to love it, I certainly love mine.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.340]   And today's episode is also brought to you
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.940]   by Athletic Greens.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.780]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.420]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.980]   I started using Athletic Greens way back in 2012
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.700]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.160]   I started using Athletic Greens
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.620]   because I found it rather confusing
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.580]   to figure out what vitamins and minerals to take.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.220]   And Athletic Greens, I get all the vitamins and minerals
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.060]   I need to cover my bases.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.620]   As well, probiotics are really important.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.660]   Probiotics have been shown now in numerous studies
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.020]   to be important for the gut microbiome,
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.020]   which impacts the gut brain axis,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.060]   as well as various aspects of bodily health.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.460]   So in Athletic Greens,
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.980]   I get vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.820]   I also really like the way it tastes.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.400]   It's a greens drink, so you mix it with some water.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.380]   You could mix it with something else like juice if you like.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.340]   I mix mine with water and lemon juice
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.380]   and I drink it once or twice a day.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.840]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.060]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.060]   And if you do that, you'll claim their special offer,
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.700]   which is to get a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.540]   There's now also a wealth of data showing
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.360]   that vitamin D3 is important for various aspects
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.460]   of brain and body health.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.740]   So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.480]   for Athletic Greens and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.160]   You'll also get five free travel packets.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.780]   The travel packets are just a really convenient way
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.480]   to take Athletic Greens when you're on the road,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.340]   in the car, or on a plane, or just moving around.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.180]   You just empty one of the packets into a water bottle
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.020]   or a glass and mix it up really quickly.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.860]   It saves any kind of mess or anything of that sort.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.100]   So once again, athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.620]   to get vitamin D3K2, that's a year supply,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.760]   and the five free travel packs.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.420]   It's a new month, which means it's a new topic
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.980]   here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.140]   For the next four or so episodes,
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.280]   we're going to be talking all about hormone effects
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.380]   on the brain and body.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.060]   So that's a huge number of different topics.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.040]   We're going to talk about sex.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.260]   We're going to talk about reproduction.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.900]   We're going to talk about puberty a little bit more.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.000]   We talked about that in the previous episode.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.660]   We're going to talk about menopause.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.280]   We're going to talk about birth control.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.060]   We are going to talk about aggression,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.500]   competition, winning, losing.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.920]   Basically, we're going to cover as much about hormones
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.980]   as we possibly can in this month.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.820]   And in doing so, we are going to go deep
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.140]   into tools and protocols.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.800]   We are also going to talk about a lot of tools
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.380]   that relate to things that you might not want to do
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.820]   in order to optimize hormone health,
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.720]   regardless of stage of life or your goals, et cetera.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.100]   So it's sure to be a month rich with discussion,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.980]   rich with tools, and you're going to learn
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.300]   a lot of neuroscience and endocrinology.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.700]   There's actually a field of neuroendocrinology.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.520]   It's actually where I started my graduate work.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.900]   I did a master's in it, which is only to say
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.920]   that I love the topic.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.540]   I have a lot of friends that work on this topic,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.620]   many of whom I've consulted for these episodes,
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.400]   and I'm really excited to share the information with you.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.660]   Before we dive into today's episode,
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.640]   all about emotions and sex,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.240]   I want to just have a few announcements
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.700]   that are designed to point you to some useful resources.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.420]   Last episode, talking about the science of emotions
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.780]   and relationships, I mentioned the Mood Meter app.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.720]   The Mood Meter app was developed by people out
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.100]   at Yale University who study the biology
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.420]   and psychology of emotions.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.100]   It's a really wonderful app.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.360]   However, many of you quickly told me
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.920]   that the Mood Meter app isn't available in your area.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.100]   You went to the link we posted,
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.100]   and it just was saying not available in your area.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.920]   The situation was actually a lot worse than that.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.820]   The situation was that when we recorded the episode,
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.380]   the Mood Meter app was working, I know,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.260]   'cause I downloaded a fresh copy of it to my phone.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.320]   And then in the ensuing weekend,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.220]   they took the Mood Meter app down for some repairs.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.460]   The Mood Meter app is now up.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.620]   It is available.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.460]   I want to be really clear.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.780]   It's not an app I'm affiliated with.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.980]   I'm just mentioning it to you.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.820]   They don't know me.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.500]   I know them, but they don't know me.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.860]   So we don't have any kind of business relationship.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.740]   They do charge 99 cents for the app.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.540]   I think the free version has disappeared
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.180]   in the last year or so.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.360]   So that's Mood Meter app.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.060]   We'll provide the link again,
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.620]   and the link should be working.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.420]   Hopefully they won't take it down again
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.740]   in between this announcement
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.620]   and the release of this episode.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.100]   Also just want to take a step back for a moment
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500]   and talk a little bit about the logic
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.260]   of how to make the most of the information
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.380]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.400]   I tend to throw out a lot of information
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.660]   about a given topic.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.420]   Many of you have pointed out, however,
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.680]   that I don't cover certain things.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.080]   And once again, I'll just say,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.440]   the goal is always to be accurate,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.140]   but there's no way I can be exhaustive.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.500]   There's no way I can cover everything
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.700]   for a particular topic.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.600]   The good news is we have time.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.440]   My goal, at least in the first year
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.460]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast is to give you a basis,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.260]   a foundation in these different topics
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.260]   of neuroplasticity, focus, sleep, hormones, et cetera.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.540]   And of course, to provide tools along the way.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.860]   We are going to host guests.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.920]   I've actually started recording
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.620]   with some of these guests already.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.620]   And even those episodes will include a little,
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.920]   what we call primer,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.220]   a little description of the basics of a given topic
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.820]   so that you can get more information from those topics.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.020]   My goal really is to educate you in these topics,
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.780]   give you a foundation in these topics
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.740]   and allow you to start exploring them here in the episodes
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.260]   with our future guests,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.380]   but also in other podcasts and books
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.180]   and other sources of information.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.520]   So for those of you that are saying
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.080]   it's too much information,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.640]   I just encourage you to remind yourself
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.840]   that you have a pause button,
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.920]   you can return to it, everything's timestamp.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.940]   For those of you who feel it's not enough information,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.180]   I'm not covering enough,
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.440]   just know that this is just the beginning.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.460]   We intend to do this for a very long time
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.140]   and we will be thorough over time.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.700]   So thanks for your patience.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.220]   And please be patient with yourselves.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.460]   There's no reason why you have to digest
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.160]   all the information in one swoop.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.660]   The other thing is that I've been told
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.300]   both that I speak too fast and speak too slow.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.440]   So there's a wonderful solution to this.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.940]   If I speak too fast or too slow,
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.140]   you can adjust the speed in YouTube.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.460]   If you're listening in a different format,
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.920]   I think you also can adjust the speed of playback.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.040]   So that's something that wouldn't be possible
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.940]   in the classroom, but you may find useful.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.980]   And then last but not least,
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.980]   I want to point people again to this NSDR,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.700]   non-sleep deep rest protocol
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.140]   that the folks over at Made For
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.140]   have put out as a free resource.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.180]   It does, as many of you pointed out,
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.300]   bear resemblance to things like yoga nidra,
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.500]   other forms of meditation.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.380]   But what we've done is we've stripped out intentions
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.580]   or any kind of the verbiage related
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.020]   to what some people might perceive
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.420]   as kind of related to the yoga community
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.820]   or specific to kind of new agey type techniques,
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.300]   not because we don't like yoga nidra.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.040]   In fact, I've done yoga nidra daily
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.660]   for almost the last, goodness, eight years of my life.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.620]   I love yoga nidra, but sometimes the complicated language
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.780]   can be a separator and can discourage people
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.460]   from taking on these protocols that are extremely useful.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.640]   So NSDR is intentionally generic.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.720]   It's designed to bring you into a state of deep relaxation
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.140]   through a combination of breathing and body scan.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.820]   There's the YouTube script over at Made For,
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.820]   which is linked in the caption.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.340]   And many people find that they prefer that
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.480]   to scripts like yoga nidra scripts,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.880]   where they're doing intentions
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.320]   and they're hearing a lot of kind of unusual language
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.220]   around the process.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.660]   This is just very basic and I hope you'll enjoy it.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.060]   And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts,
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   then go with those.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.220]   There are many of them available
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.340]   on the internet and elsewhere.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.620]   And last but not least, I want to point out
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.860]   that all our episodes now are subtitled
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.820]   both in English and in Spanish.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.020]   So for those of you that prefer
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.620]   to digest this information in Spanish,
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.300]   that's now available to you in the subtitles.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.420]   Today, we're going to talk about the science of sex,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.520]   in particular sexual differentiation.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.600]   Now that's a complicated topic
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   because sex is both a adjective, a noun and a verb,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.940]   depending on the context.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.500]   Today, we're going to talk about the hormonal effects
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.060]   and the neural effects of particular events
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.340]   that happen during development
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.720]   and how those guide adolescent and adult behavior,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.700]   including sexual preference.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.580]   It's an area that's fascinating
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.540]   and for which there are actually
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.900]   very solid textbook findings.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.260]   So textbook findings means that there are many studies
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.500]   that have been aggregated over decades
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.580]   that point to what we now know to be absolute truths
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.700]   in terms of how hormones affect brain development,
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.140]   how the brain impacts hormonal development
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.760]   and how those interact to control behavior, for instance.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.500]   We are also going to talk about reproduction, the verb sex.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.020]   And of course, sex, the verb can also be carried out
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.580]   independent of reproduction.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.380]   It's not always in particular in humans
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.180]   just to produce offspring.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.020]   So that's going to be covered in the next episode,
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.980]   but you absolutely need to understand the information
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   in this episode in order to make sense of the information
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.420]   in the next episode.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.620]   So today we're going to explore hormones,
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.040]   what they are, how they work,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.440]   what leads to masculinization or feminization
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   of the brain and body.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.140]   I'll just throw out one really interesting fact
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.160]   that perhaps most of you didn't realize
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.940]   that hormones have direct effects on the body.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.420]   Most people know that because there are hormone differences
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.100]   and sex differences in bodies in terms of genitalia
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.280]   and body hair, distribution of body hair, et cetera.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.160]   But there are also effects of hormones on the brain directly.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.060]   And believe it or not, there are also effects
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.220]   on the spinal cord, on the neurons and structures
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.920]   within the spinal cord that impact in a very direct way
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.620]   what sorts of behaviors are possible.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.140]   So it's a fascinating area.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.900]   You might notice I'm going to go a little bit more slowly
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.720]   through this topic than I normally do.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.700]   I want to be extremely careful with my language.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.880]   Some of these topics, some of you may be thinking
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.940]   are extremely sensitive, right?
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.960]   And of course, any discussion about sex and reproduction
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.180]   is a sensitive one,
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.340]   but today we're just talking about the biology.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.240]   We're not getting into the cultural constraints
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.060]   or the cultural dialogue.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.220]   What we're trying to do today is really get to the biology,
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.020]   the physiology, the endocrinology, and the behavior.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.180]   So let's start by talking about what hormones are,
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.060]   just to remind you, and what they do.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.000]   Hormones by definition are a substance,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.800]   a chemical that's released in one area of the body,
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.000]   typically from something we call a gland,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.440]   although they can also be released from neurons,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.840]   but they're released often from glands
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.160]   that travel and have effects both on that gland,
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   but also on other organs and tissues in the body.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.140]   And that differentiates hormones
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.880]   from things like neurotransmitters,
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.160]   which tend to act more locally.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.360]   So that's important.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.420]   A hormone is a substance secreted at one location,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.160]   the body travels and has impact
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.640]   on things elsewhere in the body.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.720]   Examples of tissues that produce hormones
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.140]   would be the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries, et cetera.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.780]   And then of course, there are areas of the brain
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.900]   like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.620]   which are closely related to one another
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.680]   and release hormones that cause the release
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.340]   of yet other hormones out in the body.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.320]   So we're going to cover all this.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.360]   If you don't know anything about endocrinology,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.280]   you're still going to be able to understand
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.660]   today's discussion.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.280]   And we're going to start with a discussion
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.260]   about what hormones actually do to create this thing
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.240]   that we call masculinization or feminization.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.200]   So let's start with development.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.480]   Sperm meets egg.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.720]   Everything that happens before that
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.080]   is a topic of the next episode.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.560]   But sperm meets egg.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.400]   This is mammalian reproduction.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.040]   And that egg starts to duplicate.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.740]   It starts to make more of itself.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.840]   It makes more cells.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.660]   And eventually some of those cells become skin.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.200]   Some of those cells become brain.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.620]   Some of those cells become muscle.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.560]   Some of those cells become fingers.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.680]   All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.000]   In addition, there are hormones that come both
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.080]   from the mother and from the developing baby,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.480]   the developing fetus that impact whether or not the brain
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.400]   will be what they call organized masculine
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.780]   or organized feminine.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.160]   And as I say this, I want you to try and discard
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.920]   with the cultural connotations
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.700]   or your psychological connotations
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.760]   of what masculinization and feminization are
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.120]   because we're only centering on the biology.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   So typically people have either two X chromosomes
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.200]   and the traditional language around that
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.000]   is that person is female, right?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.620]   Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.880]   And that person will become male.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.600]   Now it's not always the case.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.320]   There are cases where it's XXY,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.040]   where there are two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.580]   There are also cases where it's XYY,
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.220]   where there are two Y chromosomes.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.520]   And these have important biological
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.280]   and psychological impacts.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.080]   So the first thing we need to establish
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.140]   is that there is something called chromosomal sex.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.800]   Whether or not there are two X chromosomes
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   or an X and Y chromosome is what we call chromosomal sex.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.120]   But the next stage of separating out the sexes
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.240]   is what we call gonadal sex.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.340]   Typically, not always, but typically,
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.640]   if somebody has testes for their gonads,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.040]   we think of them as male.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.940]   And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.300]   Although that's not always the case either.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.960]   But let's just explore the transition
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.000]   from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.800]   because it's a fascinating one
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.120]   that we all went through in some form or another.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.800]   So this XY that we typically think of
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.000]   as promoting masculinization of the fetus.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.120]   We say that because on the Y chromosome, there are genes.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.860]   And those genes have particular functions
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.240]   that suppress female reproductive organs.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.400]   So on the Y chromosome, there's a gene
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.380]   which encodes for something called
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.660]   a Moolerian-inhibiting hormone.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.940]   So there's actually a hormone
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.180]   that's programmed by the Y chromosome
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.060]   that inhibits the formation of Moolerian ducts,
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.200]   which are an important part
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.460]   of the female reproductive apparatus.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.680]   That's critical because already we're seeing the transition
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.140]   between chromosome Y chromosome and gonad.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.180]   And other genes on the Y chromosome
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.400]   promote the formation of testes.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.440]   So there are genes like the SRY gene
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.000]   and other genes that promote the formation of testes
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.360]   while they also inhibit the formation of the Moolerian ducts.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.960]   So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.320]   is a very important distinction.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.920]   It's kind of a fork in the road
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.800]   that happens very early in development
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.460]   while fetuses are still in the embryo.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.560]   Now, what's interesting as well
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.440]   is that just because there's a Y chromosome
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.500]   that can suppress Moolerian duct formation
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   and there are other genes on the Y chromosome
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.080]   that promote teste development,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.360]   the placenta itself is an endocrine organ.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.480]   I think most people don't know this,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.760]   but the placenta is an endocrine organ.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.200]   As well, the mother, which of course is carrying the fetus,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.640]   has an adrenal gland, which can produce testosterone.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.160]   There are instances, for example,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.400]   where a mother has either a tumor
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.320]   or for some other reason is secreting large levels
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.600]   of testosterone while carrying a fetus that is XX,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.640]   and that leads to what we would call masculinization
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.040]   of certain aspects of the fetus.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.780]   Typically, that would be enlarged clitoris.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.100]   There are also some examples of other phenotypes on the body
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.560]   that are created even though
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.080]   it's a purely XX chromosomal baby.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.180]   So we have to distinguish between chromosomal sex,
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.520]   gonadal sex, and then there's what we call hormonal sex,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   which is the effects of the steroid hormones,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.940]   estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives,
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.800]   on what we call morphological sex
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.620]   or the shape of the baby and the human and the genitalia
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.480]   and the jaw and all these other things.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.780]   And so it actually is quite complicated.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.980]   So it's a long distance from chromosomes to gender identity,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.540]   and gender identity has a lot of social influences and roles.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.760]   This is an area that right now is very dynamic
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.960]   and in the discussion out there, as you know,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.980]   but just getting from chromosomal sex
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.940]   to what we would call gonadal sex and hormonal sex
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.760]   and morphological sex involves a number of steps.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.020]   So today we're going to talk about those steps
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.800]   and there's some fascinating things
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.480]   that do indeed relate to tools,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.400]   do indeed relate to some important behavioral choices,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.160]   important choices about things to avoid while pregnant.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.940]   And for those of you that are not pregnant,
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.500]   things to avoid if you're thinking
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.540]   about eventually having children,
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.480]   and that is not to drive development
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.760]   in one direction or another,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.580]   but there are examples where there are some deleterious
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.300]   things in our environment that can actually negatively
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.320]   impact what we call sexual development overall,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.440]   regardless of chromosomal background.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.100]   So let's get started with that.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.200]   Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.820]   Hormones generally have two categories of effects.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.500]   They can either be very fast or they can be very slow.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.240]   There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.820]   which act very fast.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.280]   Adrenaline can increase your heart rate very fast
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.500]   when it's secreted into the body.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.180]   Cortisol can be a little bit slower,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.140]   but it also can have some very fast effects.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.100]   And then there are hormones like testosterone and estrogen,
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.060]   which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.580]   The sex steroid hormones can have quick effects
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.980]   through signaling, meaning they can attach to cells
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   and make those cells do different things.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.420]   They can have actually quite quick effects on the brain.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.820]   A lot of people don't know this,
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.580]   but there are some very fast effects
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.360]   of estrogen and testosterone, as well as long-term effects.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.200]   These molecules, for those of you that are interested,
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.520]   are what are called lipophilic,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.240]   which just means that they like fatty stuff.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.160]   They can actually pass through fatty membranes.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.480]   And because the outside of cells,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.560]   as well as what's called the nuclear envelope,
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.720]   where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.240]   are made of lipid, of fat,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.120]   these steroid hormones can actually travel into cells
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.720]   and then get into the DNA,
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.880]   basically interact with the DNA of cells
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.560]   in order to control gene expression.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.160]   So they can change the sorts of things
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.480]   that cells will become,
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.400]   and they can change the way that cells function
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.600]   in a long-term way.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.860]   And that's actually how the presence of these genes,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.640]   like SRY and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.800]   lead to reductions or elimination, I should say,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.420]   of things like the Mullerian ducts
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.400]   and promote instead what's called in males,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.180]   the Wolfian ducts,
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.520]   or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.600]   So all you need to know is that hormones have short-term
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.600]   and long-term effects,
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.000]   and the long-term effects are actually related
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.840]   to their effects on genes
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.520]   and how those genes are expressed or repressed,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.380]   not in order to prevent them
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.280]   from having particular proteins made.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.040]   So these hormones, these steroid hormones,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.280]   are exceedingly powerful.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.160]   And if we're going to have a discussion
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.960]   about masculinization or feminization, et cetera,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.520]   you also need to think about the counterpart.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.480]   It's not just about masculinizing the body
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.020]   or feminizing the body and brain.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.260]   It's also about demasculinizing the brain in many cases
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.160]   as a normal biological function,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.020]   typically of XX females,
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.940]   and defeminization, the suppression of certain pathways
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.340]   that are related to feminization of the body and brain.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.500]   But there are some really fascinating twists in this story.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.980]   So I've just thrown a lot of biology at you,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.540]   but this is where it all starts to get incredibly surprising.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.160]   You would think that it's straightforward, right?
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.280]   You have a Y chromosome.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.400]   You suppress the female reproductive pathway
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.660]   like the malaria ducts.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.400]   You promote the development of testes,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.440]   and then testes make testosterone,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.700]   and then it organizes the brain male,
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.200]   and it wants to do male-like things.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.720]   And then in females, you get estrogen,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.800]   and it wants to do female-like things,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.120]   and air quotes here for all of this.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.460]   And it turns out that isn't how it works at all.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.460]   Here's where it's interesting.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.020]   We have to understand that there are effects
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.640]   of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.700]   on what are called primary sexual characteristics,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.500]   which are the ones that you're born with,
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.220]   which are the ones that show up in puberty,
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.700]   and these are happening in the brain and body
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.860]   and spinal cord.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.500]   And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.740]   by giving you some examples.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.260]   First, let's talk about the development
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.120]   of primary sexual characteristics,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.320]   the ones that show up at birth.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.680]   And one of the more dramatic examples of this
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.160]   comes from the role of testosterone
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.280]   in creating the external genitalia.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.380]   Now, you might think it's just straightforward.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.240]   If there's testes, 'cause there was a Y chromosome,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.360]   you've got a gene that codes for the development of testes,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.100]   you get testosterone, and the penis grows,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.600]   and the baby is born with a penis.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.540]   One of the first things that happens
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.960]   when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.340]   and they try and make an assessment
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.060]   on whether or not it's a "boy" or it's a "girl," right?
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.520]   That's been done for a very, very long time
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.100]   throughout human history.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.260]   It turns out that it's not testosterone
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.620]   that's responsible for the development of the penis
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.720]   in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.600]   It's a different androgen.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.720]   Androgen is just a category of hormones
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.960]   that includes testosterone,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.360]   but testosterone is converted in the fetus
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.000]   to something called dihydrotestosterone,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.240]   and that's accomplished through an enzyme
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.920]   called 5-alpha reductase.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.880]   Now, dihydrotestosterone has important effects
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.220]   later in life too.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.160]   We will talk about those.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.440]   In fact, you just want to know dihydrotestosterone
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.600]   is what we would call the dominant androgen in males.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.120]   It's responsible for aggression.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.980]   It's responsible for a lot of muscular strength.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.440]   It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.840]   We're going to talk about all of that.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.360]   But dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.340]   in determining the genitalia
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.480]   while the baby is still in the embryo.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.640]   So there's testosterone that's made,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.080]   and that testosterone gets converted
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.620]   by this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.920]   in a little structure called the tubercle.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   That tubercle will eventually become the penis.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.660]   So you say, okay, straightforward.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.700]   This testosterone's converted to dihydrotestosterone,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.960]   and then if there's dihydrotestosterone,
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.600]   it controls penis growth.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   And indeed, that's the case.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.120]   So that's a primary sexual characteristic.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   That baby will then grow up, and later, during puberty,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.040]   there will be the release of a molecule,
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.440]   I talked about this last episode,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.160]   called kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.120]   which will cause the release of some other hormones,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.040]   canadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.060]   will stimulate the testes to make testosterone.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.720]   So in puberty, testosterone leads to further growth
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.180]   and development of the penis,
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.940]   as well as the accumulation or growth of pubic hair,
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.920]   deepening of the voice,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.280]   all the secondary sexual characteristics, okay?
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.400]   So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would call
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.780]   the typical masculine phenotype
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.960]   for primary sexual characteristics.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.240]   And produces, testosterone, excuse me,
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.400]   produces secondary sexual characteristics during puberty.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.660]   There's a very interesting phenomenon
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.800]   that was published in the journal "Science" in the 1970s,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.160]   for which now there's a wealth of scientific data.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.040]   And this relates to a genetic mutation
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.300]   where 5-alpha reductase,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.740]   the enzyme that converts testosterone
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.580]   to dihydrotestosterone, doesn't exist.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.140]   It's mutated in a way in a genome that it doesn't exist.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.380]   And this actually was first identified
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.900]   in the Dominican Republic.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.980]   It has shown up elsewhere.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.440]   It's quite rare, but where it shows up, it's robust.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.300]   What happens is, baby is born.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.060]   Typically, when a baby is born,
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.620]   they don't measure chromosomes.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.960]   They don't look at chromosomal sex, XX or XY.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.240]   That's not typically done nowadays.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.460]   Baby is born.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.080]   If you were to look at that baby, it would look female.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.300]   There would be very little or no external penis.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.760]   And so people would say, "It's a girl."
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.160]   And they might have the celebration, "It's a girl."
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.760]   And I guess now they call them gender reveal parties
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.600]   or something like that.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.420]   I don't know about this.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   But anyway, the baby would reveal its external genitalia
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.220]   simply by being there and being naked when it's born.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.600]   Has nothing to do with gender.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.800]   It has to do with genitalia and sex.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.580]   That baby would be born.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.900]   And what was observed is that from time to time,
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.020]   that baby, after being raised as a girl,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.100]   perfectly happy as a girl,
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.780]   would, around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.540]   would suddenly start to sprout a penis.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.700]   There's actually a name for this.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.260]   It's called huavedosis,
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.040]   which the translation is more or less penis at 12.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.640]   And as strange as this might sound,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.540]   it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.660]   What happens in these children, these huavedosis,
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.480]   is that the child is born.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.100]   It has testes which are not descended, so up in the body.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.100]   They're not making a lot of testosterone early on.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.500]   They weren't able to convert testosterone
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.700]   to dihydrotestosterone
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.400]   because they lack this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.440]   As a consequence, the primary sexual characteristic
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.260]   And then what happens is the baby grows up as a young child,
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.760]   essentially is treated as a girl.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.860]   Generally, they report being pretty comfortable as girls,
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.320]   although not always.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.700]   And then testosterone starts getting secreted
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.000]   from the testes 'cause kisspeptin in the brain signals
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.760]   through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.000]   travels down to the testes.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.120]   The testes start churning out testosterone
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.540]   and there's a secondary growth of the penis
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.800]   and all of a sudden there's a penis.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.640]   And this leads to some very complicated situations
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.660]   in families and culturally.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.960]   And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.680]   these children decide to self-identify as males or females
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.540]   and how people treat them actually varies quite a lot.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.220]   There's actually been a kind of an adopting
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.080]   of a third category of sex and gender in these huavedosis
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.040]   in order to just offer them the opportunity
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.880]   to explore not just what would be a typical kind of girl
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.480]   or woman or boy or man phenotype, but something in between,
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.140]   something that some people call intersex,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.680]   although intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.820]   is actually a separate thing altogether.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.660]   So it's fascinating.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   And the point here is that dihydrotestosterone,
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.520]   not testosterone is responsible for this primary growth
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.100]   of the penis and that testosterone later is involved
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.420]   in the secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.920]   deepening in the voice, et cetera.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.160]   Now this is where the information gets even more interesting
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.920]   and applies to essentially everybody.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.040]   You might think that testosterone,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.400]   because it masculinizes the body
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.240]   in the secondary sexual characteristic way
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.300]   and because dihydrotestosterone, another androgen,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.800]   masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.400]   the growth of the penis early on,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.880]   that testosterone must masculinize the brain.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.380]   And there are in fact aspects of masculinization
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.700]   of the brain and body that are independent of genitalia.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.940]   Now it might be obvious to some of you,
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.880]   but some people probably don't realize that.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   Yes, indeed, the brain has receptors for testosterone.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.140]   It also has receptors for estrogen.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.680]   But the fascinating thing is that
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.860]   if you look at the brains of people that have Y chromosomes
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.180]   and that have testes and that make testosterone,
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.080]   and you look at the brains of people
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.760]   that don't have Y chromosomes or testes
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.360]   and therefore make far less testosterone in general,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.100]   what you realize is that the cells in the brain
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.020]   that differ between what I'll call males and females,
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.380]   but between XY and XX,
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.900]   have receptors for testosterone,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.440]   but the masculinization of the brain
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.720]   is not accomplished by testosterone.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.560]   I want to repeat this.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.360]   The masculinization of the brain
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.780]   is not accomplished by testosterone.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.860]   It is accomplished by estrogen.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.940]   Testosterone can be converted into estrogen
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.680]   by an enzyme called aromatase.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.440]   This is vitally important to understand.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.540]   Testosterone can be converted into estrogen
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.520]   by something called aromatase.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.040]   I'll give an example of where this happens later in life
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.540]   to just illustrate the principle
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.240]   and really embed it in your mind.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.620]   During puberty in boys, XY chromosome individuals,
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.400]   it's not uncommon for there to be transient
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.560]   or sometimes long lasting breast bud development.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.840]   Testosterone goes up during puberty
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.240]   for the reasons we talked about before.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.060]   And some of that testosterone gets converted into estrogen
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.000]   by an enzyme called aromatase.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.280]   Aromatase is made by several sources in the body.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.880]   One of the main sources is body fat.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.640]   So it can make a lot of aromatase.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.420]   Sometimes you'll even see a fairly dramatic
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.520]   breast development in males during puberty.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.600]   Sometimes it's transient, sometimes it's not.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.080]   The other place where you see this
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.840]   is in athletes and bodybuilders
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.920]   that take a lot of anabolic steroids
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.240]   that take high levels of androgens.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.040]   So they'll be taking testosterone
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.660]   at super physiological doses.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.020]   Sometimes not always,
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.820]   they will convert some of that testosterone into estrogen
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.100]   and they'll get what's called gynecomastia,
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.100]   which is the development of male breast tissue.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.460]   Sometimes they'll get it cut out surgically.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.800]   Other times they'll start trying to take estrogen blockers
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.420]   in order to try and suppress it,
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.140]   or they'll try and block prolactin.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.580]   It's a topic that we're going to get into in more detail.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.480]   But what's important here is to understand
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.820]   that testosterone can be converted
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.080]   into the estrogen by aromatase.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.560]   Aromatase is not just made in body fat.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.880]   There are neurons in the brain that make aromatase
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.280]   and convert testosterone into estrogen.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   And it is testosterone converted into estrogen.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.160]   In other words, it's estrogen that masculinizes
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   the XY individual that masculinizes the brain.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.560]   And this has profound effects on all sorts of things,
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.800]   on behavior, on outlook in the world, et cetera.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.180]   But I think most people don't realize
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.100]   that it's estrogen that comes from testosterone
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.400]   that masculinizes the male brain, the XY brain,
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.260]   not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.340]   So I just want to mention some tools.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.640]   You might be asking yourself,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.520]   how could tools possibly come up
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.000]   at this stage of the conversation
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.240]   where we're talking about sexual development
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.440]   and we're talking about the differentiation
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.560]   of tissues in the body?
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.880]   Well, this is true both for children and parents and adults.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.800]   I want to emphasize that there are things
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.820]   that are environmental and there are things
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.040]   that people use that in their homes sometimes
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.060]   that actually can impact hormone levels
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.800]   and can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.640]   And I want to be very clear.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.520]   This is not me pulling from some rare journal
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.640]   I've never heard of it.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.880]   This is pulling from textbooks.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.380]   In particular today, I'm guiding a lot of the conversation
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.540]   on work on behavioral endocrinology.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.220]   This is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Crigfield,
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.060]   true experts in the field.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.500]   I'm going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.000]   from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.760]   and their impacts on some of these things
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.820]   like testosterone and estrogen.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.320]   I'm going to touch into them.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.720]   that's grounded in studies,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.580]   which we will provide in the caption
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.320]   or that I'll reference here.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.760]   One of those that's actually really interesting
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.740]   but helps illustrate the principle
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.120]   that we've been talking about is a few years ago,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.960]   there was a lot of excitement about evening primrose oil.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.460]   Evening primrose oil is in a lot of products
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.740]   that typically are associated with skin beauty
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.720]   and skin health.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.040]   And so I'm generalizing here,
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.360]   but typically it was mothers or sisters that were using it.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.160]   And there were actually examples starting to crop up
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.460]   of young boys getting accelerated breast bud development
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.400]   from skin contact with women
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.320]   who were using evening primrose oil.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.600]   So evening primrose oil is chemically a lot like estrogen
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.840]   and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.580]   There are a number of things out there like this.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.840]   So believe it or not, things like pine pollen
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.660]   look very much like testosterone.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.760]   Structurally, they are more or less are testosterone.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.540]   Their bioavailability in humans isn't as clear.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.900]   Evening primrose oil has a lot of estrogenic elements to it,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.560]   just structurally how it's built.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.280]   And so there were cases where boys were understandably
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.700]   being hugged by their mom or maybe even like showering
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.760]   and using the evening primrose oil solution.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.400]   Those things will actually change levels of estrogens
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.880]   in boys and girls.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   And so this wasn't just an issue for young boys.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.320]   This was also an issue for young girls.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.700]   So it's not that evening primrose oil is bad.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.060]   It's just that many of you have probably heard
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.560]   about the dangers of soy and isoflavones
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.740]   and things like that.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.040]   The impact of soy on estrogen levels
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.400]   is there are some decent evidence to support that.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.600]   However, there's a lot of other factors
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.480]   that are more severe.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.120]   And one of those is this evening primrose oil.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.400]   So regardless of age, let's just put it this way
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.960]   because people might be wanting to drive their hormones
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.600]   more estrogenic or more androgenic.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.360]   How could I know what your preference is?
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.240]   I don't know.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.340]   But in any case, things like evening primrose oil
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.480]   can actually promote estrogenic pathways in the body.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.180]   And some of it can go transdermal.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.660]   Likewise, because testosterone replacement therapy
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.500]   is fairly widespread nowadays
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.480]   and some people accomplish that through cream,
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.760]   it's pretty well understood that if someone's taking that,
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.040]   that they want to avoid contact with anyone,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.660]   skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.360]   more estrogenic activity in their body
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.640]   and especially in children.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.520]   So that's one.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.240]   The other is this issue of environmental factors.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   Now this, again, I'm just going to highlight,
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.720]   when one starts talking about environmental factors
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.240]   and how they're poisoning us or disrupting growth
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.600]   or fertility rates,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.880]   it can start to sound a little bit crazy
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.560]   except when you start to actually look
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.080]   at some of the real data,
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   data from quality research labs funded by federal government
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.780]   funded not from companies or other sources
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.120]   that are really aimed at understanding
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.760]   what the underlying biology is.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   And for that, we should all be grateful to Tyrone Hayes
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.400]   at UC Berkeley.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.800]   I remember way back when I was a graduate student
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.780]   in the late '90s, goodness, at UC Berkeley.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.980]   And I remember him, he was studying frogs.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.040]   He was talking about developmental defects
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.920]   in these frogs that live in different waters around,
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.600]   it was California, but also elsewhere.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.260]   And he identified a substance which is present
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.540]   in a lot of waterways throughout this country
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.360]   and other countries, so US and beyond,
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.400]   certainly not just restricted to California,
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.800]   which is atrazine.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.840]   This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.520]   Again, this is the stuff of textbooks
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.260]   and it causes severe testicular malformations.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.400]   So again, atrazine exposure is serious.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.780]   And what's interesting is if you look at the data,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.160]   what you find is that at sites in Western and Midwestern
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.480]   sections of the United States,
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:27.120]   10 to 92% of male frogs, these were frogs, mind you,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.160]   had testicular abnormalities.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.440]   And the most severe testicular malformations
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.040]   were in the testes rather than in the sperm.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.940]   So it's actually the organ itself, the gonad itself.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.860]   Now, it's very well known now
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.360]   that atrazine is in many herbicides.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.840]   And so, whereas I would say in the '80s and '90s,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.320]   the discussion around herbicides and their negative effects
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.300]   was considered kind of like hippie-dippie stuff
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.800]   or the stuff you hear about it,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.720]   your local community markets
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.520]   and these kind of new-agey communities,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.360]   now there's very solid data from federally funded labs
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.840]   at major universities that have been peer reviewed
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.000]   and published in excellent journals,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.200]   showing that indeed many of these herbicides
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.040]   can have negative effects,
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.680]   primarily by impacting the ratios of these hormones
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   in either the mothers or in the testes,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.600]   altering the testes of the fathers,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.260]   or direct effects on developing young animals
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.320]   and potentially humans.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.160]   And so you ask, well, what about humans?
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.120]   Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.780]   So here are the data on what's happening.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.400]   And this isn't all going to be scary stuff.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.720]   We're also going to talk about tools to ameliorate
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   and offset some of these effects.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.700]   One would be be cautious with evening primrose
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.200]   as well as testosterone creams,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   depending on whether or not you want to be more androgenic
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.960]   or estrogenic, depending on your needs.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.080]   But across human populations,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.720]   sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.600]   So in 1940, the average density of human sperm
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.720]   was 113 million per milliliter of semen.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.560]   That's how it's measured.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.880]   How many sperm per milliliter of semen?
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.080]   In 1990, this figure has dropped to 66.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.480]   It went from 113 million per milliliter
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.560]   to 66 million per milliliter
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.640]   in the United States and Western Europe.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.140]   So it's not just a US thing.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.920]   Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.680]   produced by men has dropped 20% in that time,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.660]   reduced sperm count per ejaculation even further.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.920]   So between 1981 and 1991,
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.720]   the ratio of normal spermatogenesis
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.740]   So there's a lot that's happening
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.520]   primarily because of these herbicides
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.340]   that are in widespread use to reduce sperm counts.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.220]   And these are going to have profound effects,
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.180]   not just on sperm counts, but on development,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.160]   sexual development at the level of the gonads and the brain
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.400]   because you need testosterone to get you
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.960]   to dihydrotestosterone for primary sexual characteristics.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.840]   You need estrogen that's come from testosterone
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.000]   to masculinize the brain.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.440]   And of course,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.500]   we're not just focusing on sperm and testosterone.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.200]   You of course also know that many of these herbicides
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.740]   are disrupting estrogens in a similar way
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.500]   or are leading to hyperestrogenic states,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.120]   which might explain why puberty is happening
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.440]   so much earlier in young girls these days.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.240]   So there are a lot of things that are happening.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.480]   Now, does this mean that you have to run around
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.440]   and neurotically avoid anything that includes things
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.520]   like atrazine and should you be avoiding
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.160]   all kinds of herbicides?
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.820]   I don't know, that's up to you,
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.000]   but it does seem that these have pretty marked effects
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.640]   in both the animal studies and in the human studies.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.080]   You can open up a textbook like the endocrinology textbook
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.460]   and find things like vinclozolin.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.840]   This is V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.860]   which is a fungicide and it's an anti-androgen.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.680]   You give it to animals, to rats,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.120]   and instead of forming a penis, they don't form a penis.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.200]   They basically, it's not that they form a clitoris,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.720]   they just don't form a penis.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.960]   So let's talk about female sexual development.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.120]   And as always, what we'll do
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.640]   is we'll talk about the normal biology.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.920]   Then we'll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.160]   or unusual set of cases, but we'll talk about them
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.700]   because they illustrate an important principle
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.680]   about how things work under typical circumstances.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.180]   So there is a mutation
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.920]   called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.000]   And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.680]   can help you really understand
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.760]   how hormones impact sexual development.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.460]   So here's how it works.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.040]   There are individuals who are XY,
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.440]   so they have a Y chromosome,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.280]   that are born, that make testosterone,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.180]   they have testes, and they don't have Mullerian ducts
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.200]   because on the Y chromosome
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.360]   is this Mullerian inhibiting hormone.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.560]   However, these individuals look completely female.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.720]   And in general, they report feeling
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.280]   like girls when they're young, women when they're older.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.900]   But there's something unusual that's happening
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   in these individuals because they have an XY chromosomal type
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.540]   and not XX, so what's happening?
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.940]   Well, what's happening is the testes are making testosterone
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.480]   but the receptor for testosterone is mutated.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.700]   And therefore the testes never descend.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.100]   They don't have ovaries, they have testes,
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.920]   but the testes are internal.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   And so typically these individuals find out
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.900]   that they are actually XY chromosomes
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.880]   so that their chromosomal sex is male, if you will,
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.580]   and their gonadal sex is male,
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.960]   but the gonads, the testes are inside the body,
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.940]   they don't actually develop a scrotum,
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.020]   they don't make ovaries,
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.180]   and when they don't menstruate around the time of puberty,
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.180]   that's a sign that something is different.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.880]   And so they never menstruate around puberty,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.300]   and if they look into this deeply enough,
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.360]   what you find is that they are actually XY,
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   they make testosterone,
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.420]   but their body can't make use of the testosterone
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.880]   because they don't have the receptors.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.920]   And the receptors are vitally important
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.140]   for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.740]   that we talked about, body hair, penis growth
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.880]   during puberty, et cetera.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.100]   They live fairly happy lives as females,
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.060]   although of course they can't conceive, right?
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.260]   They don't have a uterus, they don't have ovaries.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:51.500]   They also in general don't produce sperm in quantities enough
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.020]   that they could actually reproduce with somebody else,
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.580]   although sometimes they can.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.300]   And believe it or not, and I'm not going to name names,
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.380]   but there are actually reports of several people,
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.540]   fairly prominent people throughout history
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.200]   who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.860]   or people suspected they did.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.340]   And the reason to not name names
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.380]   is that it gets right to the heart
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.180]   of whether or not they are male or female.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.560]   How could you say, right?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.360]   They have XY chromosomes,
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.420]   but go Natalie, they have testes that are inside,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.740]   and yet if you looked at their bodies,
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.680]   if you looked at their faces,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.660]   you would say almost with certainty
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.900]   that they appeared female.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.160]   And that naturally occurring experiment
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.700]   points to the fact that testosterone
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.060]   that shows up in the body
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.800]   and impacts the things at the levels of the receptor
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.740]   has a profound effect on phenotype,
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.940]   on the external or body plan.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.700]   So again, we're talking about this
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.020]   in order to illustrate the principle
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.160]   that in order to have its effects,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.560]   a hormone doesn't just have to be present,
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.820]   that hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.920]   and take action on the target cells.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.540]   And once again, I'll just throw out the example
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.060]   of where people are using performance enhancing drugs,
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.700]   although that's a pretty broad statement.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.100]   Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.700]   about the so-called SARMs,
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.140]   which are more on the receptor side.
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.540]   And so we'll talk about this in a future episode.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.780]   And I just say that as a teaser
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.020]   because the SARMs and what's happening right now
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.160]   in augmenting sports performance,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.660]   both with testosterone directly,
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.120]   but also testosterone derivatives,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.320]   and then also altering things at the level of the receptor
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.780]   is exceedingly interesting
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.300]   and is revealing to us the many ways
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.660]   in which hormones can impact brain and body
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.540]   in ways that we didn't suspect.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.980]   Perhaps the simplest way to understand
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.260]   how estrogen and testosterone impact masculinization
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.700]   or feminization of the brain and behavior
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.620]   is from a statement.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.020]   It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.460]   that my colleague Nirav Shah
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine published,
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.920]   which is that estrogen, again,
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.860]   it's estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   by aromatase, sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.580]   and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.900]   So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.400]   Estrogen does that.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.600]   Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.200]   And testosterone is then what controls
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.880]   the display of those behaviors later in life.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.020]   And I find that incredibly interesting.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.040]   You would think it was just testosterone did one thing
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.440]   and estrogen did another,
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.040]   but it turns out that nature
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.340]   is far more interesting than that.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.720]   Okay, so what are some things
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.520]   that impact sexual development early in life
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.700]   and later in life?
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.320]   Let's talk about cannabis.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.580]   Let's talk about alcohol.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.700]   And dare I say, let's talk about cell phones.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.400]   Something that I never thought I would ever do
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.260]   either in this podcast or in the classroom,
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.660]   but these days there are really interesting data
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.340]   and I think you should be aware of them.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.420]   First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.900]   I realize that there are now
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.720]   a lot of different variants on this.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.520]   There are a lot of different strains of cannabis.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.960]   I personally am not a pot smoker.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.040]   It's just not for me.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.800]   I'm not talking about the moral or legal implications.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.520]   In some states it's decriminalized,
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.160]   in other places it's really illegal,
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.280]   in other places it's basically legal.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.900]   You have to check where you live and understand the laws.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.660]   That's not what this is about.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.760]   What we do know, however,
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.640]   is that with the exception of one study,
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.760]   there are many studies that point to the fact
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.080]   that THC and other things in cannabis
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   promote significant increases in aromatase activity.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.660]   Now, pot smokers aren't going to like this,
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.840]   especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this,
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.140]   but it's the reality.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.960]   Remember, what you're hearing in the background
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.720]   is Costello snoring really loud.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.880]   Should we put him on screen?
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.800]   He's not a cannabis smoker, but you can imagine why.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.320]   Here, come here Costello, come here buddy, come here.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.160]   He's asleep.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.080]   Come here, he's right, come here.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.920]   There you go.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:23.820]   This dog definitely does not need cannabis.
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.420]   This is his state for most of the time.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.580]   He is highly, apparently he's asleep still.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.120]   So some of you have asked to see Costello.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.460]   If you're just listening on audio,
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.200]   maybe he'll give us something.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.040]   That's it.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.280]   Oh, okay, we're going to let him get back to sleep.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.200]   He's always here.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.040]   Some of you have asked to see him.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.920]   Costello is not a pot smoker either.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   He did have a dog sitter that was a pot smoker years ago.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.880]   It was his favorite dog sitter, but I'm not a pot smoker.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.980]   Again, no judgment, but here's the deal.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.960]   That cannabis, and it's not clear if it's THC itself
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.760]   or other elements in the marijuana plant
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.860]   promote aromatase activity.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.480]   Now, this has been observed anecdotally
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.040]   where pot smokers have a higher incidence
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.960]   of developing something I mentioned before, gynecomastia,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.940]   breast bud development,
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.520]   or full-blown breast development in males.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.480]   There may be some women who want to increase
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.080]   their estrogenic activity.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.040]   Remember, females make testosterone.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.960]   It comes from the adrenals, right?
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.080]   They don't have testes.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.880]   So it comes from the adrenals
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.420]   and that testosterone can also be aromatized.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.520]   Although typically most of the aromatase activity
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.800]   that we're referring to in these examples is in males.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.960]   So testosterone can increase estrogenic activity.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.780]   So you might say, oh, therefore,
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.280]   does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.580]   Does it create all sorts of things
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.960]   that are related to low testosterone?
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.060]   Not necessarily, not necessarily, and here's why.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:03.600]   Estrogen itself in males and females
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.640]   is important for things like libido and sexual behavior.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.120]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   If estrogen is too low in males,
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.820]   it can actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:19.740]   So you don't want estrogen too high or too low,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.660]   whether or not you're male or female.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.520]   Now, of course, in females,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.920]   estrogen levels tend to be higher than in males.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.600]   I'm speaking very generally here.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.440]   You just think back to the chromosomal sex.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.260]   That's what I'm referring to when I say male or female,
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.540]   although there's nuance there, of course.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.920]   In females, the testosterone that comes
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.280]   from the adrenals has a powerful effect
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.660]   on libido and desire to reproduce.
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.540]   And in the next episode,
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.100]   we're going to talk about how that works
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.860]   in its relationship to birth control,
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.500]   its relationship to menopause.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.340]   We're also going to talk about
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.440]   how that whole thing works in males as well.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.400]   But cannabis and other aspects of the marijuana plant
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.780]   can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.220]   by increasing aromatase.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.800]   And so people should be aware of that.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.540]   As well, there are good data.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.860]   I was able to find several studies
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.340]   on PubMed pointing to the fact
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.540]   that smoking marijuana during pregnancy
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:19.540]   can shift the pattern of hormones in the developing fetus
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.020]   such that it promotes more estrogenic outcomes.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.900]   Now, earlier I said that estrogen
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.900]   is what masculinizes the male brain.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.480]   In utero, that's true.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.420]   But the way that cannabis seems to work,
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.940]   at least from the studies I was able to identify,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:38.500]   is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.480]   and therefore can counteract
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   some of the masculinizing effects
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.920]   of things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.660]   on primary and secondary sexual characteristics.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.560]   So I mention this because, you know,
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.960]   I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.280]   and certainly during puberty,
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.000]   it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   And so we'll do another episode
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.180]   that goes really deep into this,
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.540]   but yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.840]   by increasing aromatase.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.260]   Most everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.100]   is not good for the developing fetus.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.220]   Fetal alcohol syndrome
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.080]   And it's something that there are cognitive effects
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.740]   that are really bad.
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.040]   There's actually physical malformation, et cetera.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.700]   So drinking during pregnancy, not good.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.900]   Probably drinking during puberty, not good either,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.280]   because alcohol, in particular, certain things like beer,
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:49.140]   Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.480]   from estrogenic activity.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.000]   It's also protecting girls from excessive
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   or even hypoestrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.900]   Now, many teenagers drink, college students drink,
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.200]   and it's important to point out
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.180]   that puberty doesn't start on one day
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.960]   and end on another day.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.280]   Puberty has a beginning, a middle, and an end,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.080]   but development is really our entire lifespan.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   This idea that puberty has us open and close,
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.480]   that's just false.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.100]   Okay, so we talked about cannabis.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.860]   We talked about alcohol.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   Let's talk about cell phones.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   First of all, I use a cell phone.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.240]   I use it very often,
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.380]   and I do not think they are evil devices.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.920]   I think that they require some discipline
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.400]   in order to make sure
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.220]   that it does not become a negative force in one's life.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.220]   So I personally restrict the number of hours
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.020]   that I'm on the phone and in particular on social media.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.860]   I only answer email at particular times of day.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.520]   But what about the cell phone itself?
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.380]   When I was a junior professor,
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.980]   that's our pre-tenure, early professor,
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.300]   I taught this class on neural circuits
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.700]   and health and disease.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.960]   And one of the students asked me,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.140]   are cell phones safe for the brain?
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:11.840]   And all the data pointed to the fact that they were,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.980]   or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.780]   I still don't have the answer on that, frankly.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.200]   I don't see a lot of studies about it.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.440]   I'm not personally aware of any evidence
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.220]   in quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.520]   showing that cell phones are bad for the brain
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.500]   or that holding the phone to the ear is bad
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.360]   or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.340]   I'm just not aware of any quality studies.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.360]   If you are aware of quality studies, peer-reviewed studies,
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.580]   please reference them, put them in the comment section,
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.580]   send them to me, however you like.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.800]   I'd love to see them.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.640]   I'm not aware of them.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   However, I was very interested in a particular study
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.680]   that was published back in 2013 on rats.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.200]   It was basically took a cell phone
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.800]   and put it under a cage of rats
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.120]   and looked at basically testicular and ovarian development
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   in rats and saw minor but still statistically significant
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.640]   defects in ovarian and testicular development.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.080]   Since then, and now returning to the literature,
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.040]   I've seen a absolute explosion of studies,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.280]   some of which are in quality journals,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.920]   some of which are in what I would call
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   not blue ribbon journals, identifying defects
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   in testicular and/or ovarian development
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   by mere exposure to cell phone emitted waves,
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.000]   let's just call that.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   We don't know what they are.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.520]   And this sounds almost crazy, right?
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.400]   Anytime somebody starts talking about EMFs
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.520]   and things like that, you kind of worry,
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.880]   like, is this person okay?
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.240]   But look, the literature are pointing in a direction
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:50.240]   where chronic exposure of the gonads to cell phones
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.200]   could be creating serious issues in terms of the health
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.880]   at the cellular level and in terms of the output.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.900]   So the output for the testes would be sperm production.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.560]   Swimming speed in sperm is an important feature
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.760]   of sperm health.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.640]   In the ovaries, it would be estrogenic output,
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.980]   how regular the cycles are.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.120]   So in animals, the cycles are a little bit different
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.020]   than in humans.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.140]   They don't have a menstrual cycle.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.580]   They have an estrous cycle,
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.440]   which is generally around four days.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:23.420]   I think that it's fair to say based on the literature
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:27.980]   that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.600]   on gonadal development.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.000]   The question is, what is the proximity of the cell phone
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.840]   to the gonads?
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.020]   Now I've taken the literature as I observe it.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.940]   And then of course, we'll point you to in the captions.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:45.260]   And I don't like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.180]   I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless,
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.500]   some of these effects were seen in adult animals.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.260]   So let's just talk about a couple of those effects.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.720]   So a paper published in the journal,
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.460]   Clinical Biochemistry from Eskander et al,
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.140]   looked at hormone profiles in people
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   based on proximity to their phone and frequency of phone use
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.480]   where they stored their phone on their body,
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.660]   as well as proximity of where they lived to,
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.140]   I guess they're called these radio frequency towers,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.760]   so the base stations.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.680]   And they were looking at effects of radio frequency,
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.760]   radiation, RFR on human hormone profiles.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.600]   And they show significant decreases in cortisol.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.060]   You might say, well, that might be good,
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.720]   but you need that morning cortisol bump
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.400]   in order to wake up morning cortisol is good.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.080]   But also thyroid hormones were significantly reduced.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.720]   Prolactin in young females, that's definitely concerning
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.300]   and testosterone levels in males and females.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.340]   And so there are now quite good data showing
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.220]   that being close to the phone too much of the day
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.140]   and how close is an interesting question
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.620]   or living near one of these base stations
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.660]   apparently can have effects on hormone profiles.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.460]   And when you see a study like this, one should always ask,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.040]   well, what are the other things
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.660]   that could also have effects on these hormone profiles?
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.660]   'Cause you could imagine that if you ran the same study
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.660]   of people that live close to a waterway
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.680]   or close to a highway where there's a lot of exhaust
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.360]   from buses and cars, you might see similar effects.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.920]   So you have to take these sorts of studies
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.240]   with a grain of salt, but I think it's very interesting.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.620]   And given that the last time I looked into these data
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.100]   where way back when I was a junior professor
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.740]   and there was like one or two studies that I could find,
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.180]   one of the studies pointed to increases in testosterone
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.420]   in rats where they had close proximity
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.300]   to these radio frequency radiation waves.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.780]   And then in the other case that showed decreases
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.980]   in testosterone, so there really wasn't any conclusion
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:52.820]   to take away from that.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.220]   Now there's pretty impressive amount of data
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.360]   pointing to the fact that there are effects
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.920]   of these things on hormones.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.420]   I don't know what to do with that information.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.020]   I'm not going to stop using my phone,
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.500]   but in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and others
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.040]   looking at sperm counts and looking at the decrease
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.100]   in testosterone levels in sperm counts
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.420]   and fertility over the last 20, 30 years,
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.860]   perhaps it's not surprising.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.580]   Although there again, cell phones and smartphones
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.380]   have really been in prominent use
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.460]   mostly within the last 10 or 11 years.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.140]   And so it's hard to explain all of those declines
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.740]   simply on the basis of cell phone use.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.540]   There's some interesting effects of hormones
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.940]   that actually you can observe on the outside of people
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.300]   that tell you something about
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.240]   not just their level of hormones,
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.680]   but also about their underlying genetics.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.240]   And these relate to beard growth and baldness.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.440]   And it's fascinating.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.120]   The molecule, the hormone dihydrotestosterone
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   made from testosterone is the hormone primarily responsible
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.080]   for facial hair, for beard growth.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   As well, it's the molecule, the hormone primarily responsible
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.320]   for lack of hair on the head for hair loss.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.560]   So how does that work?
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.600]   Well, DHT circulates in the body
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.040]   and it binds to DHT receptors in the face
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.340]   to promote hair growth.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.440]   But it binds to DHT receptors on the scalp
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.160]   to promote hair loss.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.420]   Not incidentally, the drugs that are designed
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   to prevent hair loss are 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.160]   So remember 5-alpha reductase from the huevadosis?
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.520]   Well, the people that discovered the huevadosis
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.240]   went on to do a lot of research
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.120]   on the underlying biochemistry
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.540]   of this really interesting molecule, dihydrotestosterone.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.760]   They identified 5-alpha reductase
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.340]   and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.120]   are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.680]   that are out there.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.280]   And so there are some interesting things here.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.040]   First of all, the side effect profiles
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.100]   of those treatments for hair loss
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.240]   are quite severe in many individuals.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.800]   Remember DHT is the primary androgen for libido,
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.560]   for strength and connective tissue repair,
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.080]   for aggression, even if that aggression
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.600]   of course is held in check,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.520]   but just sort of ambition and aggression
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.600]   is related to dopamine,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.000]   but within the testosterone pathway,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.100]   less so to pure testosterone,
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.860]   although pure testosterone has its effects,
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.360]   but DHT is at least in primate species, including humans,
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.080]   is the dominant androgen
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.000]   for most of those sorts of effects.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.560]   And if you look at somebody,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.000]   everyone can predict whether or not they're going to go bald
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.300]   based on looking at their,
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.280]   we're always taught our mother's father.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.640]   So if your mother's father was bald,
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.480]   there's a higher probability that you're going to go bald.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.960]   The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.880]   will dictate whether or not
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.560]   you're going to go bald everywhere
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.200]   or just in the front or so called crown type baldness.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.800]   And the density of the beard
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.920]   tells you about the density of DHT receptors.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.180]   Now this varies by background, by genetic background,
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.240]   and actually around the world nowadays
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.100]   because people travel and people form couples
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.000]   and have kids with so many different people
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.440]   of different mixed cultures,
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.880]   you're seeing this starting to disappear,
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.080]   but there are areas of the world
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.040]   where all the men seem to have the same pattern of baldness,
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.760]   like a strip of baldness down the center
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.080]   with hair still on the sides and full beards,
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.180]   that's because these patterns of DHT receptors
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.020]   are genetically determined.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.740]   Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high,
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.560]   DHT levels in the blood can be very high,
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.300]   and yet people will have very light beards or no beards,
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.940]   and that's because they don't have
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.260]   a lot of DHT receptors in the face.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.440]   And still other cultures,
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.700]   you'll see people with huge beards, tons of beard go,
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.520]   like their beards are growing all the way up to their eyes
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.780]   and they have huge heads of hair,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.460]   and that's because they have a lot of DHT receptors
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.860]   on the face and not on the scalp.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.260]   So there are a lot of effects of DHT
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.360]   that you can just see in male phenotypes.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.260]   And it's interesting that these hair loss drugs
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.920]   that are, or to prevent hair loss drugs,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.300]   are directly aimed at preventing
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.860]   the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.960]   and that's why they, to some extent, prevent hair loss,
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.380]   but also to some extent have a bunch of side effects
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.820]   that are associated with low DHT.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.280]   Along these lines, there's a particular sports supplement
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.780]   that a lot of people use called creatine.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.840]   Creatine now, there's a lot of research
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.700]   showing that creatine can bring more water into the muscle.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.820]   It can support strength.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.700]   It does a number of other things.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.180]   Might even have some important cognitive promoting,
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.180]   cognitive enhancement effects, although mild.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.740]   The studies there show that it can be significant.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.660]   Some people, not all, it's more anecdotal,
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.980]   report that creatine promotes hair loss.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.540]   It differs by individual.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.900]   For some people, that's true.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.340]   For others, no.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.840]   But yes, it does appear,
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.920]   based on the studies I was able to find on PubMed,
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.320]   that creatine does promote 5-alpha reductase activity,
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.440]   and therefore the conversion of testosterone
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.160]   into dihydrotestosterone.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.760]   And so it makes sense that it might promote
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.980]   some degree of hair loss as well as beard growth,
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.220]   as well as the other effects of DHT.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:31.380]   I recall in junior high school and middle school,
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.140]   going home one summer, it was seventh grade,
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.100]   coming back in the eighth grade,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.000]   and a kid that I knew that I was friends with
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.380]   went from being like a young kid to,
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.400]   he was like a grown man, he had a full beard.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.240]   It was amazing.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.780]   It was like he would completely transform.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.420]   I mean, puberty, as I've said before,
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:49.420]   is without a doubt the most accelerated rate of development
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.660]   that we will go through at any point in our lives,
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.180]   even faster than infancy,
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.900]   just in terms of the huge number
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.180]   of different cognitive changes and physical changes.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.640]   Not surprisingly, that same individual
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.800]   was mostly or bald by his early 20s.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.000]   And that's because he must've had
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.040]   just exceedingly high levels of DHT.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.360]   I also played soccer with this kid,
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.200]   and he was basically like dribbling past everybody.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.520]   He was like a grown man playing soccer
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.040]   with a bunch of little kids, full beard, bald at 20.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.440]   And so the rate of maturation,
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.940]   the rate of aging is very interesting.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.400]   It's hard to know rate of aging.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.600]   There's some genetic tests that now can allow you to do that,
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.560]   things like Horvath clocks and things of that sort.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.880]   Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard and others
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.480]   has pointed to this.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be,
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.400]   I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.100]   might be an interesting window
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.640]   into how fast one is going through
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.520]   their aging or developmental arc
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.020]   because development, of course,
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.440]   doesn't just start at birth and end after puberty,
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.560]   it continues your entire life.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.600]   So I think it's interesting.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.520]   You will often see that people, boys and girls,
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.020]   I should say boys or girls, will develop
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.600]   secondary sexual characteristics at different rates.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.320]   And sometimes it's sequential.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.080]   You might see a kid will, she'll grow very tall
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.920]   or she'll have a big growth spurt,
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   but then breast development will come a little bit later.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.680]   And then other features will come a little bit later.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.980]   You can also see this in boys.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.680]   The person that I referred to earlier,
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.800]   my friend that developed full beard, went bald.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.240]   He was also quite muscular, he was a great athlete.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.400]   So he went through puberty exceedingly fast.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.120]   Other people go through it more slowly.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.700]   Some people will go through puberty at age 14,
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.000]   but they won't start to accumulate facial hair
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.940]   until much, much later.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:40.040]   Or their voice will change first very early,
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.240]   and then they won't get the other secondary
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.720]   sexual characteristics until much later.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.280]   And so we don't really know how that impacts
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.440]   or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging,
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.760]   but it's an interesting thing to think about
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.280]   for each and every one of us.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.720]   I'm going to offer you the opportunity
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.200]   to do an experiment today while listening to the podcast.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   But first I want to tell you a story about hyenas,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.540]   professional baseball, and clitorises the size of penises.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.400]   So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.720]   we had a professor in our department,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.480]   phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   Steve Glickman had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas,
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.540]   that lived within caged enclosures, of course,
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.180]   in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley campus.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.900]   The enclosures are actually still there.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.940]   I run past there fairly often.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.020]   The hyenas are no longer there.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.360]   This was a federally funded field station.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.600]   These animals were brought over from Africa
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.480]   or were bred there.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.040]   And the reason why there were hyenas in Tilden Park,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.480]   enclosed in Tilden Park,
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.880]   was because hyenas exhibit an incredible feature
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.600]   to their body, their hormones, and their social structure.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.640]   Hyenas, unlike many species,
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.000]   have a situation with their genitalia
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.440]   where the male penis is actually smaller
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.940]   than the female clitoris.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.200]   And I should say that the male penis itself,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.840]   having seen a fair number of hyena penises,
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.700]   is not particularly small,
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:26.720]   which means that the hyena clitorises are extremely large.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.220]   This was well-known for some time.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.760]   It turns out that in these spotted hyenas,
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.020]   the females are dominant.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.540]   So after a kill, the females will eat,
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.240]   then their young will eat,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.840]   and then the male hyenas will eat.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.040]   As well, when the female hyena gives birth,
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.080]   she gives birth not through the vaginal canal
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.440]   that we're accustomed to seeing,
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   but through a very enlarged clitoris-like phallus,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.680]   although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.660]   and it literally splits open.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.360]   So many fetuses die
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.220]   during the course of hyena development and birth.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.380]   These animals have this,
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.820]   what could only be described as a very large
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:19.940]   sort of giant clitoris,
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.260]   although for a hyena, it's not giant, it's normal,
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.240]   and it splits open, and the baby actually comes through.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.100]   The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue,
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.620]   and it's a very traumatic birth.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.860]   A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:36.840]   And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this,
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.020]   we'll call it masculinization,
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.940]   but it's really androgenization
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.460]   of the periphery of the genitalia.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:55.460]   And it turns out through a lot of careful research
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.000]   done by Steve Glickman, Christine Dre, and others,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.700]   that it's androstenedione,
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.620]   what is essentially a pro-hormone to testosterone,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:10.520]   it's androstenedione at very high levels
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.580]   that's produced in female hyenas
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.640]   that creates this enlargement of their genitalia.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.300]   So if you want to read up on androstenedione,
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.020]   androstenedione is made into testosterone
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:27.020]   through this enzyme, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:32.300]   It's a complicated pathway to pronounce.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.580]   It's a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.220]   You may recall during the '90s and 2000s,
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.580]   there were a lot of performance-enhancing drug scandals,
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.040]   in particular in Major League Baseball.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.660]   And it was purported,
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   although I don't know that it was ever verified,
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.740]   but it was purported
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.660]   that the major performance-enhancing drug of abuse
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.940]   at that time in particular players,
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.020]   whose names we won't mention,
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.380]   but you can Google it if you want to find out,
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.740]   was androstenedione.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.500]   And I actually recall long ago
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.540]   when you could buy androstenedione in the health food stores
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.100]   and so it was sold over the counter.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.100]   So a lot's changed since then,
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.360]   but it's interesting that these hyenas
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.980]   with these highly androgenized genitalia
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:24.060]   accomplish that through high levels of androstenedione
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:24.900]   in the females.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.140]   Now, if that's unusual,
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.940]   what might be even more unusual
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.300]   is that a graduate student
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.260]   that I was working with at the time,
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.220]   alongside, we didn't share research,
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.500]   her name was Nicola Sipka.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:40.340]   She is actually a trained animal behavioral expert.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.780]   She had trained ferrets for that show, "The Beastmaster,"
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.660]   and she would train wolves for television shows
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.780]   and was a dog trainer.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.260]   She had these two large dogs that unlike my dog
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.340]   would actually listen to her
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.700]   when she would give them commands.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.080]   A remarkable scientist.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.340]   She was studying a species of mole
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.860]   that also lived in Tilden Park.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.740]   People are going to start to wonder about Tilden Park,
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.040]   what's in Tilden Park?
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.640]   But this particular mole that lived there
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.060]   had testes for part of the year
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.500]   and had the capacity to trans-differentiate its testes
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.400]   into ovaries in order to balance out the ratio
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.260]   of males and females in the population
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.440]   to keep reproduction at appropriate levels
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.260]   for that certain population.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.220]   So some animals are actually able to adjust
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.160]   whether or not they have androgenized
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.060]   or estrogenized gonads
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.840]   in order to adjust the ratios of offspring
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   or the males and females in there for promote offspring.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.960]   And the last little anecdote about this,
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.140]   which is also published in the scientific literature,
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.360]   which is weird, but I do find interesting.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.680]   Hormones are so fascinating.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.480]   They're just incredible to me,
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.900]   is going back to the marijuana plant.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.760]   The marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.740]   And I asked a plant biologist
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.380]   whether or not this was unusual.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.500]   And I asked because there's all this stuff out there
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.300]   about, oh, soy does this,
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:12.940]   and these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera,
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.920]   although we should probably point out
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.820]   that a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.020]   So this isn't a meat versus plants thing.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.280]   But this plant biologist told me,
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.620]   oh yeah, there are plants that make
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.000]   what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.500]   like pine pollen, it looks a lot like testosterone.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.340]   And there are other plants that make
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:33.020]   what is essentially estrogen.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.700]   And I said, well, why would they do that?
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.620]   And plants, at least as far as I know,
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.540]   don't have a consciousness, they don't have a brain,
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.180]   they don't have neurons even.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.220]   But his answer was fascinating.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:48.020]   He said that one of the reasons
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:51.080]   why some plants have evolved this capacity
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   to increase estrogen levels in animals that smoke,
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.680]   not smoke it, but then animals that consume them,
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.520]   I'm guessing that animals aren't smoking marijuana,
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.180]   although, I don't know, send me the paper
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.000]   if you've heard of this,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.840]   is that plants have figured out ways,
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.800]   they've adapted ways to push back on populations of rodents
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.060]   and other species of animals that eat them.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:17.640]   So plants are engaged in a kind of plant to animal warfare
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.980]   where they increase the estrogen of the males
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.160]   in that population to lower the sperm counts
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.420]   to keep those populations clamped at certain levels
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.300]   so that those plants can continue to flourish
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:33.140]   even if those animals are reproducing very robustly.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.180]   And I find this just fascinating.
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.760]   And hormones, therefore,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.860]   aren't just impacting tissue growth and development
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.340]   within the individual and between the mother,
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:47.360]   remember the placentas and endocrine organ and the offspring,
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.840]   but plants and animals are in this communication.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.360]   And today we're in this communication.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.520]   I'm telling you that there are certain herbicides
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.000]   that humans are using for which there's very good data
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.360]   are disrupting the endocrine pathways.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.160]   And so it's fascinating that humans and other animals
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.320]   were always in this interplay with plants
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.880]   and the other things in our environment.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.940]   And hormones and adjusting the hormone levels
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.040]   of animals and plants is one way
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.080]   in which the environment kind of pushes back
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.200]   or pushes forward, if you will,
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.740]   in terms of promoting their wellbeing and longevity,
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.960]   as well as you trying to promote
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.800]   your wellbeing and longevity.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.920]   If anyone wants to see the incredible paper
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.880]   by Steve Glickman and colleagues,
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.020]   it was published in the "Prosthetics of the National Academy"
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:33.400]   first in 1987, that's Glickman et al.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.880]   That was the hypothesis that it was androstenedione.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   And then if you just Google Glickman Hyenas Science Magazine,
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.200]   there's a beautiful cover article and feature
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.840]   all about that important discovery.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.240]   It's a fascinating one.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.320]   And I should mention also that those discoveries,
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.240]   both the moles and the hyenas weren't just impactful
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.480]   for the world of animal behavior and endocrinology.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.440]   They've also strongly impacted understanding
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.640]   of conditions that show up in the clinic,
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.600]   which we haven't talked about today,
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.040]   which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.120]   Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.200]   if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.900]   And this has a very important ethical and other issues.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.960]   Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:23.560]   It's not super uncommon for this to happen.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.160]   And there've been terrible cases where people have gone
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.160]   against the chromosomal sex and the person was very unhappy
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.920]   with the choice that their parents had made for them.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.620]   There were also cases where they've gone
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.080]   with the chromosomal sex and the person was very happy
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:39.960]   about the outcome.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.280]   There've been cases where they've been treated with hormones
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.120]   and there've been cases
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.620]   where they have not been treated with hormones.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   It's a complicated literature and it has to be sorted out
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.400]   on kind of a case by case basis,
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.040]   but it is something that does happen.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.960]   And the studies on androstenedione and hyenas
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.880]   and in these very interesting moles,
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.820]   pseudo hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.040]   have impacted not just the science,
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.280]   but the therapeutics around those important issues.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.520]   So now last but not least,
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.840]   I want to discuss the effects of hormones
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.560]   while you and I were separately in utero
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.280]   and the effects that that had on who we are,
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:28.960]   who we select as mates, so mate choice, sexual preference,
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.640]   and all other aspects
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.400]   of what you would call sexual development.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.600]   Now, this is something that's gotten a lot of popular press
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.960]   and it has to do with how exposure to androgens in particular
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.600]   while we were in utero impacted whether or not people report
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.600]   as homosexual, heterosexual, identify as male or female.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.220]   I'm very familiar with this work
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.120]   because I was a graduate student in the department
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.300]   that first published this work
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.580]   and I'm an author on the paper.
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.620]   I was not the main driver of the work,
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.540]   but I was involved in the work
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.040]   and I certainly know the people that did this work.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.420]   First, it starts with a story.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.760]   There was a researcher who's still going now.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.460]   His name is Dennis McFadden.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:19.060]   I believe it was at UT Austin back then.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:22.200]   And he was studying the auditory system
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.560]   and people would come into his clinic
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.700]   and he would, or his laboratory,
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.560]   and he would look at hearing
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.120]   and he would explore different aspects
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.720]   of what they call the psychophysics of hearing
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.300]   and understanding hearing thresholds
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.820]   and frequency thresholds.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.800]   And he made several observations
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.960]   and those observations were that young males
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.060]   tended to have what are called autoacoustic emissions
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.800]   more often than young females did.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.160]   Autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.620]   are the ears actually making sounds.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.400]   Now these sounds have to be picked up by a special apparatus
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.880]   'cause they can hear into that frequency,
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.440]   but it turns out that your ears don't just take sound waves
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.200]   and convert them into these things that we,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.280]   this thing we call hearing,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.520]   but they also, in some cases, make sounds.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.360]   So your ears are making sounds, strange, right?
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.420]   So it turns out that there's a sex difference
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.740]   in autoacoustic emissions.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.480]   Turns out also that people that self-report as lesbians,
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.580]   they also have autoacoustic emissions significantly more
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.480]   than females that don't self-report as lesbian.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.520]   And Dennis noticed this and published this,
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.340]   and it was an important discovery
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.360]   because it was one of the first discoveries
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:43.360]   that pointed to the fact that there are sex differences
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.920]   in biology that are independent of sex.
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.120]   I mean, this is hearing and autoacoustic emissions.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:54.120]   And just to really illustrate what the former problem was
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.600]   and why this study was so important,
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.640]   a lot of people had explored, for instance,
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   whether or not homosexuals had lower testosterone,
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.720]   for instance, in males.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.760]   And actually the result often was the opposite,
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.000]   that gay men or men that self-report as gay
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.440]   often had much higher testosterone.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.040]   And those studies then became controversial
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.580]   because people said, well, sexual behavior
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.460]   can relate to testosterone, et cetera.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.240]   And so it became very controversial.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.420]   And then there were some studies that attempted to look
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.440]   at the equivalent phenomenon in people
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.260]   that self-report as lesbian or self-report as heterosexual.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:31.820]   And so it became very complicated,
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:36.160]   but this was an identification of a phenomenon,
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.020]   autoacoustic emissions, that was independent of anything
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:41.520]   that had to do with sexual or even social behavior.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:48.120]   1998 rolls around and I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.880]   and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove,
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.000]   kind of an ironic name given that he worked
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.320]   and still works on sexual dimorphism in the brain
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.380]   and in the spinal cord and nervous system.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.360]   And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist,
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.600]   comes running down the hall, I'll never forget this,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.960]   and he said, "Give me your hands."
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.200]   I was like, "Give me your hands."
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.560]   And he pulls out a ruler and he starts measuring my fingers
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.880]   and he takes down a couple of measurements
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.600]   and then he goes away.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.500]   And I'm like, "What was that?"
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.320]   Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.320]   at that point, and soon after we did a study
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.920]   that Mark directed exploring the finger length ratios,
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.040]   and I'll explain what those are, of males and females
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.780]   and people that self-reported
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.480]   as homosexual or heterosexual.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.780]   So let's just get to the basic,
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.520]   what we'll call sex differences first.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.360]   These are averages I want to point out.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.000]   Anytime you get into this kind of topic,
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.360]   people assume it's causal, but it's not causal.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.600]   These are averages that I'm about to report.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.520]   It is the case that the ratio
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.000]   of what's called the D2 to D4 digits.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.100]   So the D2 is your index finger, so your thumb is D1,
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.560]   then D2 would be your index finger that you would point with,
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.280]   middle finger is D3, which you whatever with,
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.500]   and then D4 is the so-called ring finger, okay?
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.760]   And D5 is the pinky.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.840]   It is the case that the D2 to D4 ratio
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.060]   is greater in self-reported females than it is in males.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.440]   What does that mean?
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   It means that digit D2 and D4 are more similar in length
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.680]   in females than in males.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.760]   And the effect is particularly, excuse me,
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.160]   pronounced on the right hand, although not always, okay?
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.440]   And it does not have to do with handedness.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.800]   This D2 to D4 difference has to be measured correctly.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.680]   You can't just look at somebody's hands and say,
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.960]   oh, their ring finger and index finger are very similar
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.280]   and therefore they are female
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.880]   or they were exposed to very little testosterone in utero.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.560]   You can't look at somebody and see that their index finger
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.040]   is much shorter than their ring finger and say,
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.740]   oh, they must've been exposed to a lot of androgen.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.920]   You have to actually measure it
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.880]   and you have to measure it correctly.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.380]   You have to measure it from the base of the finger
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.240]   where there's that first crease all the way to the tip,
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.680]   past the, you can't include the fingernails
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.560]   if you're growing fingernails,
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.160]   it would be logical here, folks.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.940]   So you can't normally see it from the back of the hand.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.900]   Although I don't know if this will show up here,
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.260]   but if you look at the back of the hand,
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.600]   sometimes you can see it.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.000]   In my case, for instance, let me see if I can do this.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.720]   So my D4 is a little bit longer than my D2.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.400]   In some people it's more pronounced
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.280]   and that's on my right hand.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.120]   On the other hand,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.640]   the difference actually is far less pronounced.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.160]   It's a little bit pronounced there, but not so much.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.600]   So that's sort of the typical ratio that you would see.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.740]   Turns out that in mice and in humans,
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.180]   the more androgen that you were exposed to in utero,
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.980]   the smaller the D4, D2 ratio,
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:05.780]   meaning that the ring finger tends to be slightly longer
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.460]   than the pointer finger.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.440]   And in females,
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.040]   because they're exposed to less androgen in utero,
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.320]   typically, then those fingers tend to be more equal in length
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.040]   and these are subtle differences and these are averages.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.920]   I invite you to look up the paper.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.800]   This was published in Nature in 2000
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.400]   and it's been replicated six times.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.760]   Now here's where it gets even more interesting.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.540]   And potentially precarious,
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.440]   so we're going to step cautiously here.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.260]   If you look at the finger length ratios
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:40.640]   of men that self-report as homosexual,
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.320]   they have either the typical male pattern
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.600]   of D2 to D4 ratio
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.200]   or a hyper-masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.600]   Now this can't be something that's established
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.700]   or modified by behavior.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.040]   This has to be something that was established in utero
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.660]   and in fact, it's present at birth.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.720]   So it completely divorces the interactions
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.260]   between hormones and behavior.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.140]   And that's an important theme that we've been talking about
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.900]   and we're going to talk about even more next episode
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.400]   is that hormones impact behavior,
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.100]   but behavior also impact hormones.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.860]   But this is a case of hormones impacting
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.340]   what really should be considered
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.780]   a primary sexual characteristic
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:20.260]   because it doesn't show up in puberty,
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.380]   it shows up before puberty,
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.900]   it's actually established in utero.
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.020]   And in people that self-reported lesbians,
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.260]   and I remember going out there
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.300]   and collecting these data with these,
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.860]   with the collaborators on this work.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.620]   Again, I wasn't the main driver on the work,
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.220]   but I participated in some of the analysis.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.140]   People that self-report as lesbians
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:43.140]   also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.380]   So this is consistent with the autoacoustic emissions study
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.220]   that Dennis McFadden had published.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.860]   And it points to the fact that early exposure to androgens
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.620]   may have an impact,
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.180]   not just on androgenization
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.540]   of the body plan,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:04.540]   but also separately on sexual preference.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.940]   Now, this raises all sorts of interesting questions
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.980]   about biological basis of sexual preference.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.800]   I'll tell you about another study,
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.780]   a guy named Simon LeVay, who was at UCLA,
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.540]   who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.740]   If any of you remember early episodes on plasticity,
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.260]   David Hubel and Torrance and Wiesel,
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.860]   my scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.620]   for discovery of critical periods for brain plasticity.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.580]   They defined some of the most important aspects
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.620]   of how we see and brain plasticity.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.840]   Simon LeVay trained with them.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.300]   And then Simon went on to discover
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.620]   that in the brains of people that self-report homosexual,
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.420]   there is a brain difference.
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.940]   And the brain difference is in an area
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.520]   called the interstitial nucleus
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.580]   of the anterior hypothalamus.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.300]   So it's the INAH.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:54.740]   And so there are published reports
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.340]   that was published in Science.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.140]   The other work I refer to as published in Nature
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.700]   and then replicated no fewer than six times.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.140]   And the McFadden results
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:06.740]   that point to strong biological correlates
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:11.560]   of mate choice of sexual preference.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.560]   And these tie directly to things like androgenization
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.880]   or estrogenization,
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.940]   meaning we could call it maleness or femaleness,
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.620]   but that's sort of tricky territory
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:24.700]   because of the way that we described the huge range
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.000]   in which sex can be defined earlier.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.780]   So if you want to measure D2, D4 ratio, you're welcome to,
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:33.940]   but you also have to understand
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:36.700]   that it's not predictive of anything, right?
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:39.980]   It's just a window into the possible androgen exposure
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.560]   that you had early in life.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.660]   There are plenty of men who report themselves
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.380]   as heterosexual who are out there
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.300]   who have similar or have D2, D4 ratios to females.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.780]   And there are plenty of females whose index fingers
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.480]   are shorter than their ring fingers.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.760]   And they're perfectly happy
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.540]   or they say they're perfectly happy
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.100]   and we are inclined to believe them being heterosexual.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.060]   So there's variation.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.060]   In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.980]   If you want to know whether or not
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:09.060]   somebody is homosexual or heterosexual,
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.780]   simply look at their hands,
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:15.220]   look at their D2, D4 ratio and guess heterosexual
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.520]   and you'll be right 96% of the time.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.100]   Because 96% of the time,
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:21.980]   people report themselves as heterosexual on average.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.660]   Those numbers might be changing.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.120]   So the joke really is a joke on science
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.420]   because that falls within the realm
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:29.960]   of statistical significance.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.820]   And yet it really illustrates the fact
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.800]   that none of this is causal.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.600]   But it's nonetheless very interesting
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.840]   because it means that hormones are organizing
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.280]   the brain early in development
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.340]   in ways that can potentially impact
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:45.940]   same or opposite sex partner choice later in life.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.100]   Now, of course, there are other things
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.780]   that can impact opposite sex
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.180]   or same sex partner choice later in life.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.580]   The study did not look at people who reported bisexual.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.740]   There hasn't been a lot of studies on that yet.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.420]   One thing that's very interesting
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.940]   for which there are some good scientific data
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.740]   but there's also some controversy
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:07.580]   is that it appears that the probability
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:11.860]   of a male human self-reporting as homosexual
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.420]   increases with the number of older brothers that he has.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.220]   Now, that doesn't mean if you have an older brother
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.800]   or even if you have 10 older brothers
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.860]   that you are sure to self-report as homosexual.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:26.840]   But statistically, it becomes more likely
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.360]   that somebody will with each successive older brother
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.520]   that they have.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.160]   And the idea that's starting to emerge
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:37.120]   in the developmental neuroendocrinology landscape
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   is that there's a record within the mother
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.380]   of how many male fetuses she's carried
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.380]   because male fetuses are secreting certain things,
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:50.500]   dihydrotestosterone, other things that can feed back
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.860]   onto the genome.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.380]   So these could be epigenomic effects
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.700]   or onto the placenta itself
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.620]   so that there's a higher probability
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.480]   in subsequent pregnancies
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.880]   that offspring will self-report as homosexual.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.060]   So it's a fascinating area of biology.
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.500]   And as you've noticed today,
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.680]   none of this deals with the current controversies
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.980]   around gender and how many genders and sex, et cetera.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:17.080]   That's a separate conversation that is by definition grounded
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.700]   in the kind of concepts we've been talking about today
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.400]   and needs to take place,
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.980]   taking into consideration all of the aspects of sex
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:28.580]   and the effects of hormones, both on the body, on the brain.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.980]   We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord,
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.120]   but we will in the next episode.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.700]   But we can just say on the brain and the periphery,
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:38.060]   early effects, late effects, acute effects,
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:40.140]   meaning effects that are very fast
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.220]   of levels of hormones going up or down,
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.700]   something that absolutely happens
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.340]   during and across the menstrual cycle,
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.920]   as well as long-term effects,
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.700]   like the effects of these hormones on gene expression.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.460]   So today, as always, we weren't able to cover
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.660]   all things related to sex and hormones
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.820]   and sexual differentiation or development.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.120]   There's no way we could,
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.340]   but we have covered a lot of material.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.340]   We talked about some effects of environmental toxins.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:12.900]   We talked about potential effects of cell phone radiation,
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.700]   something I never thought that I would be talking about,
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.380]   especially not in a podcast,
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.420]   but for which there are interesting emerging data.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:23.340]   We talked about considerations about evening primrose oil
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:24.580]   and its estrogenic effects,
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.140]   about creatine and its pro-DHT effects,
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.140]   about cannabis, alcohol,
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.760]   about plants exerting warfare on animals
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.180]   by increasing aromatase,
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.140]   the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.380]   We talked about hyenas with giant clitorises,
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.800]   and we talked about moles that convert from having ovaries
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.300]   to testicles, and throughout this,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.500]   Costello has been snoring nonstop.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.000]   He missed all of it,
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.300]   although he might be learning it in his sleep
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.820]   for all I know.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.980]   And I do understand it's a lot of information,
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.800]   a lot of detail.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.300]   As always, I just want to remind you,
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.060]   you don't have to absorb all the information at once.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.660]   Next episode, we are going to be talking about
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:06.700]   the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction.
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.500]   We're also going to be talking about effects of hormones
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.700]   on various aspects of behavior
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:14.140]   and ways to modulate hormones
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:19.140]   through the use of behavior, supplementation.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:22.020]   Also, we'll touch on diet and nutrition a bit,
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.040]   and we're going to talk about interactions
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.140]   between those things and behavior
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.240]   as they relate to important themes,
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.280]   like sex and reproduction, like workplace performance,
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.860]   like motivation and drive, and even anxiety.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.820]   There's a very interesting relationship
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.180]   between hormones and anxiety
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:42.400]   and the desire to explore novelty.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.260]   So just remember as we go forward
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.400]   that hormones affect behavior
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.760]   and behavior affects hormones,
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.020]   but that doesn't mean that cutting off your index finger
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:53.140]   will increase your testosterone.
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.940]   Many of you have asked how you can help support the podcast,
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.700]   and we thank you for the question.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.020]   There are several ways to do that.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.100]   The first one is to subscribe on YouTube.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.060]   If you haven't subscribed to the YouTube channel already,
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.300]   please do so.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.020]   As well, please hit the subscribe button
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.400]   so you're sure not to miss any of the episodes.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.500]   We do release episodes every Monday,
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.400]   but we also occasionally release short clips in between.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.720]   As well, if you could subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify,
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.780]   that's very helpful.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.500]   And on Apple, you have the opportunity
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.660]   to leave us up to a five-star review
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.380]   and to leave a comment.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.580]   On YouTube, please do leave us comments
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.580]   and suggestions for future episodes.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.100]   We really appreciate the feedback
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.200]   and we appreciate those suggestions.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.820]   Also ask us any questions you have
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.100]   about the material.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.780]   Those questions help guide our office hours,
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.420]   this discussion about your questions
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:40.860]   that we hold from time to time,
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:43.420]   as well as inform future content.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.500]   Also, if you could tell people about the podcast,
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.040]   please tell your family, your friends, your coworkers,
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.460]   anyone that you think might benefit from the material.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.700]   That really helps us get the word out.
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.180]   As well, if you're interested in supplements,
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:58.860]   we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:36:59.940]   and we've partnered with Thorne
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:02.380]   because Thorne has the highest level of stringency
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.120]   with respect to the ingredients
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.820]   that they put in their products,
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.460]   as well as the precise amounts of those contents.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.840]   A lot of supplement brands out there
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.480]   claim to have X amount of some supplement,
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.980]   but then when people have measured the amount
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:16.980]   in capsules and tablets,
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.140]   it's turned out to be very different.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.540]   Thorne is very precise about this.
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.160]   They partnered with important and stringent institutions
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.260]   like the Mayo Clinic, all the major sports teams,
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.300]   so that's why we partnered with Thorne.
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.160]   If you want to try any of Thorne's products,
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.380]   if you want to see what I take, you can go to Thorne,
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:36.380]   that's T-H-O-R-N-E, .com/u/huberman.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.540]   And if you do that,
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.060]   you can see any of the products that I take,
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.500]   you can get 20% off any of those,
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.800]   as well as 20% off any of the other products
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.040]   that Thorne makes.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.720]   So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.460]   Please also check out our sponsors,
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.660]   check out the sponsor links.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.420]   That's perhaps the best way to support us.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.060]   And of course, I want to point out
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.160]   that any of the ways that support us,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.420]   whether or not they are cost-free,
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.940]   like subscribing and leaving comments,
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.200]   or whether or not you're interested in the products
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.860]   that I've referred to, those all help us,
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.900]   and so we really appreciate it.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.540]   So once again, I want to thank you
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.140]   for embarking on this journey through neuroscience,
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.140]   and today, neuroendocrinology with me,
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.760]   and as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.340]   [upbeat music]
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:22.920]   (upbeat music)
