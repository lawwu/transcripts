[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020]   I think people should send out as many messages as possible.
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.840]   There's this entrepreneur who I've invested in Matt.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.200]   Matt reached out to the real founder of Netflix, Mark Randolph, and
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900]   he got a fricking response back.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.340]   And then Mark Randolph became his advisor.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.260]   And then in the book that talks about the story of how Netflix was
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.660]   really founded by Mark Randolph.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.260]   There's a reference to Matt in the fricking book.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.660]   And then I asked Mark Randolph, the founder of Netflix.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.700]   I said, is Matt Morales really like, how do you connect with him?
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.260]   Is he someone who you really are advising over the years?
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.720]   He said, yeah, he just reached out to me and I care about entrepreneurs.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.780]   So I responded back to him.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.460]   And in fact, I invested in his latest business Oasis and he's a good person.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.260]   I go from one fricking email out of the blue, I think people are too
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.980]   intimidated to reach out and it's a problem.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.520]   We should also be reaching out to strangers whose work we like on the
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.700]   internet and tell them why we like it because they're trying to establish a
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.380]   relationship with their audience too, and with people they care about.
