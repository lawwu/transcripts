[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.080]   When people drink, no matter who you are,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.480]   initially there's that shutting down
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.500]   of those prefrontal cortical circuits.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.280]   There's a gradual shutting down of the circuits
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.540]   that control memory,
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.940]   but then people divide into these two bins.
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.280]   And these two bins are the people who,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.160]   after more than a couple of drinks, start to feel sedated.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.300]   And the people who, after more than a few drinks,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600]   do not start to feel sedated.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.020]   Now, of course, there's going to be differences
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.340]   created by how quickly people are drinking,
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.200]   whether or not they're combining different types of alcohol,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   the types of alcohol, et cetera.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.320]   But in general, that can predict whether or not
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.680]   you're somebody who has a predisposition
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.340]   for alcoholism or not.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.680]   One also very interesting finding
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.920]   is that alcohol changes the relationship
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.360]   between what's called the hypothalamus
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.980]   and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.220]   Now, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.800]   about the size of a large gumball
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   that sits above the roof of your mouth.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.020]   And it houses neurons that are responsible
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.200]   for some incredible aspects of our behavior and our mindset.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440]   Things like rage, things like sex drive,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.080]   things like temperature regulation,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.120]   very primitive functions,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.640]   including appetite, thirst, et cetera.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.920]   Alcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160]   remember, it's water and fat soluble,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.360]   has effects on the hypothalamus.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.760]   The hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   to what's called the pituitary gland.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320]   This is a little gland that actually sticks out of the brain,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.220]   but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.420]   And then the pituitary releases hormones
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840]   into the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.700]   Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.980]   in your lower back.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.860]   And the adrenals release, as the name suggests,
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.420]   adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.820]   and also a molecule called cortisol,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.740]   which is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.660]   has some healthy effects too on the immune system.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.580]   Okay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.740]   I know that's a mouthful.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.220]   You don't need to remember the names,
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.660]   but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.640]   maintains your physiological balance
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.240]   of what you perceive as stressful
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   and what you don't perceive as stressful.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.220]   People who drink regularly.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.840]   So this, again, could be just one or two drinks per night,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.360]   or it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.800]   or just on Saturdays, or maybe just on the weekend,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.120]   two to four drinks.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.840]   Well, those people experience changes
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.080]   in their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.980]   that result in more cortisol,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.400]   more of this so-called stress hormone being released
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   at baseline when they are not drinking.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.960]   This is really important.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.100]   People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit,
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.320]   I don't mean one or two sips
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.800]   or even a glass of wine every once in a while.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   I mean, again, people that are maybe having
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   one drink a night with dinner
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880]   and maybe on the weekend, a few more.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.480]   Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.200]   to explain how it could also be
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720]   two or three drinks on Friday
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.840]   or six drinks only on Saturday.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.260]   Well, all of those groups experience increases
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.220]   in cortisol release from their adrenal glands
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.540]   when they are not drinking.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.340]   And as a consequence, they feel more stressed
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.660]   and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.180]   This is a seldom-talked-about effect of alcohol
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.420]   because so often we hear
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.420]   about the immediate effects of alcohol, right?
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.280]   And we've been talking about some of those effects,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.520]   effects like reducing the amount of stress.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.740]   I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say,
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.500]   "Oh, I need a drink," and then they have a drink,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.700]   and they're like, "Calm down."
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.740]   Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.120]   They can start to think about things
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360]   in a maybe more grounded or rational way,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.500]   or at least they believe that,
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.360]   or they can somehow just relax themselves.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.120]   Well, while that very well may be true,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.380]   that it can relax them,
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.380]   when they are not drinking,
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.060]   that level of cortisol that's released at baseline
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.280]   has increased substantially.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.700]   Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.780]   between brain and body,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.320]   and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.980]   to some of the other hormones
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.100]   involved in the stress response.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.660]   We'll provide a reference to the study
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.300]   that describes how all of this works
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   for those of you that really want to delve into it.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.580]   But let's go back to this issue
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.600]   of those who are prone to alcoholism
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.100]   versus those who are not.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.940]   Remember, there are people who have genetic variants,
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.860]   meaning genes that they inherited from their parents,
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.980]   that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.140]   But there are also people who drink often,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.000]   who start to experience this increase in alertness
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.820]   the longer they drink across the night.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.980]   Part of that effect, we think,
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.300]   is because of changes
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.040]   in this hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520]   So alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.400]   It's causing changes in our brain circuitry
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.520]   and neurochemistry that,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.040]   at the time in which we're inebriated, are detrimental,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.220]   and it's causing changes in neural circuitry
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.000]   that persist long past the time
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.760]   in which we're experiencing the feeling
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.820]   of being tipsy or drunk.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.100]   Now, again, I don't want to demonize alcohol.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.200]   I'm not saying, oh, you know,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.760]   if you have a glass of wine now and again,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.960]   or you drink a beer now and again,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.400]   or even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   or a shot, that that's necessarily terrible for you.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.720]   I certainly do not want that to be the message.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.220]   What I'm saying is that
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.420]   if people are ingesting alcohol chronically,
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.240]   even if it's not every night,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.180]   there are well-recognized changes in neural circuits.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.900]   There are well-recognized changes
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.020]   in neurochemistry within the brain,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.240]   and there are well-recognized changes
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.680]   in the brain-to-body stress system
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.200]   that generally point in three directions.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.340]   Increased stress when people are not drinking,
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.340]   diminished mood and feelings of well-being
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.380]   when people are not drinking,
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.380]   and, as you'll soon learn,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.540]   changes in the neural circuitry
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.200]   that cause people to want to drink even more
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.900]   in order to get just back to baseline
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.340]   or the place that they were
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.080]   in terms of their stress modulation
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.320]   and in terms of their feelings of mood
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.520]   before they ever started drinking in the first place.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.240]   So again, I don't want to demonize alcohol,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.940]   but I do want to emphasize
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.380]   that there are long-term plastic changes,
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.200]   meaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.880]   that across a period of several months,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.480]   and certainly across a period of years
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.600]   of the sorts of drinking patterns I described,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.280]   which I think, for most people,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.520]   are going to sound pretty typical, right?
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.920]   I mean, nothing that I described so far
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.400]   was about drinking a case a night
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.520]   or about binging on alcohol
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.640]   in the way that we often hear about it in the news.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.760]   These are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.880]   I mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.280]   or actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.600]   in a sunny area of the US,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.000]   and people are having three, four, five,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.720]   six beers, et cetera.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.960]   Again, personal choice is personal choice.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.140]   I'm not telling you what to do,
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.800]   but it's very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.280]   are changing neural circuitry
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   and they're changing hormone circuitry.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   And I'd love to be able to tell you
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.420]   that they're changing them for the better,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.180]   but they simply are not.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.680]   They're actually changing them for the worse.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120]   And worse is defined as making people
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   less resilient to stress,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.280]   higher levels of baseline stress,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.600]   and lower mood overall.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.180]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.560]   (upbeat music)
