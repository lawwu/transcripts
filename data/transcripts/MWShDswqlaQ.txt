[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.660]   - Speaking of preaching, we have another question
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.660]   on the topic, this one from a podcast listener
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660]   named Caleb who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.200]   Pastor John, the teaching style of look at the book
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.240]   is extremely helpful as you mark up a Bible text
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960]   on a screen on videos available at DesiringGod.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380]   Would you ever consider adopting this method
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.540]   for when you preach a sermon?
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.100]   Why or why not?
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.540]   What would you say to Caleb?
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.140]   - I will probably lose this battle
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.160]   but because of how omnipresent visual media are in our day
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.580]   and I love to use them in their right place
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.400]   but I suspect I'll fight this battle till the day I die.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   No, I don't encourage the use of any visual media
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.520]   in preaching including what I do in look at the book.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   Look at the book for me is an exposure for others
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.720]   to see of what I do in private to get at the meaning
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.080]   of texts and to get ready to preach or teach.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.640]   It's not a replacement for preaching
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   and I do think there is a place for it,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240]   namely look at the book type analysis of text
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.900]   with an overhead projector or some kind of media.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.360]   I do think there's a place for that in the church
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.120]   and I would encourage pastors and Sunday school teachers
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640]   to do it in classes and other settings
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.640]   that are not considered the heralding of God's word
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.760]   but rather the more informal explaining of texts.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.920]   In other words, I don't think preaching
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   is the only important form of communication
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.400]   in the New Testament or in the church.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.140]   There's a place for visual analysis like look at the book
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.900]   and a place for discussion and a place for Q&A
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.020]   and a place for poetic expression and song,
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.320]   et cetera, et cetera, but none of these is preaching
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.540]   and I wanna preserve the integrity
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.720]   of preaching as preaching.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   I think it has a special place in God's design
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.740]   and God's purposes for the church.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.740]   Now, before I say why that is,
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.820]   let me just make clear that in all my 40 plus years
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.420]   of preaching, I've never in my own church
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.540]   used an overhead projector or a slide or a picture
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.060]   or a movie clip or a skit or anything else.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.140]   I know that this is almost taken for granted
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.420]   nowadays by preachers and I don't expect everybody
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.300]   to follow me in this regard,
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.740]   but it might have a leavening effect for good
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.100]   if I just at least give my opinion
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   for why minimal or zero media in preaching is better.
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.020]   It has to do with my understanding
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.860]   of the very nature of preaching.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.200]   When Paul says in 2 Timothy 4, to preach the word,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.220]   he uses a word, keruso, which implies heralding
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.700]   like what a town crier does.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.020]   Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, the emperor has a message
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.980]   for all the people of the empire,
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.340]   all who were involved in the recent insurrection
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.860]   will be granted full amnesty if they lay down their weapons
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.020]   and swear allegiance to the king.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.780]   That's what a kerux does, he heralds,
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.320]   he announces, he proclaims.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.460]   Now he might have to circle back and explain
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.540]   for somebody on the front row what amnesty means,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.980]   like, ooh, excuse me, preacher, amnesty,
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.140]   what are you talking about?
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.060]   But he'll never speak as one who is indifferent
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.420]   and he knows he carries great news
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.180]   of utterly important things from an infinitely important
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.100]   king, and so I've called preaching
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.100]   expository exaltation with a U, E-X-U-L-T-A-T-I-O-N.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.020]   Preaching exalts over the truth that it explains
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.020]   and this exaltation is a work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.940]   or it's unreal.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.940]   It's an act of spirit-anointed worship.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.780]   It's experience of the truth as glorious
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.420]   and beautiful and precious,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.180]   even while the truth is being explained,
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.380]   and therefore preaching is a work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.020]   It carries in it a power, the old-fashioned word unction,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.400]   an anointing from God for the accomplishment
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.140]   of his miraculous purposes in preaching,
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.140]   and my experience is that the intrusion of other media
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.640]   into this moment of spirit-anointed heralding
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.960]   does two negative things.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.480]   One, it signifies a loss of trust
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.680]   in the preached word itself,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   and two, it distracts from the actual spiritual dynamic
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.940]   of the flow of the power of the spirit
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.260]   from the word to the preacher to the people.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.960]   It starts to create an atmosphere of the classroom
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.280]   or the lecture hall or the theater,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.000]   and all of those atmospheres are contrary
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   to what I call the atmosphere of expository exaltation,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   the very atmosphere of worship.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   This preacher is worshiping over the word,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.080]   and a sacred mediation of divine truth
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.180]   is happening into the minds and hearts of people.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.520]   Preaching has its own dynamic and its own atmosphere.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.120]   It's a kind of incarnation in the preacher
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.120]   of the beauty and the value of the truth
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.980]   of God's word in Scripture.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.980]   So I say again, I doubt that I will win this battle,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.480]   but it seems to me that preaching of this kind
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.280]   was not a temporary phenomenon
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.360]   for the first 2,000 years of Christian history,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.660]   followed by something more technologically arresting
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.640]   for the remainder of church history.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.360]   I suspect that for those who have really tasted
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.960]   the nature of true preaching,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.000]   there will always be a pull away
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.160]   from technical media intrusions
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   into that sacred, precious, powerful hour
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.600]   called expository exaltation.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.000]   If they know it, there's nothing like it.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.560]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.360]   I can imagine some listeners familiar
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   with Bethlehem's multi-campus model will ask,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   how does this priority not conflict
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   with preaching on video and using video
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.700]   of the preacher's preaching, either live or recorded?
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.840]   What would you say to that?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.560]   - Well, I've done it for many years at Bethlehem
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.080]   because we have campuses.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.940]   I regard it as not ideal.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.360]   It seemed to be the best solution,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.620]   given our options 13 years ago.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.720]   That is a little different than what I was talking about
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.420]   in the sense that the video is an attempt
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.020]   to capture the moment of preaching,
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.440]   not intrude into the moment of preaching
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.920]   with something different from preaching.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   You see the difference?
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.760]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   - So I would much rather be encountering the people
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.240]   face-to-face because of the living dynamic
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   between the preacher and the people,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.000]   but all the arguments that I just gave
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   are not mainly arguments against duplicating
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.400]   the authentic moment of preaching
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.720]   by showing it on a screen in another place
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.640]   or even in the same place, like when I preach at Passion,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.680]   you know, they got a screen up there
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.820]   because they can't see me from a quarter mile away
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.880]   up in the bleachers.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   So I don't think anything I've said is undermined
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   by the use of the replication of the moment
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.020]   in another place by the video.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.400]   Nevertheless, I would say that in the fullest,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.200]   most wonderful moment of expository exaltation,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.020]   it is an incarnation of a real person
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.600]   and a real people connecting in a real room.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760]   - Very good, thank you Pastor John.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.560]   And if you want more information about,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.240]   look at the book and the style of teaching
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.300]   that we've been talking about today,
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.160]   go online and check them out at DesiringGod.org/labs,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.360]   L-A-B-S.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   And we're gonna return tomorrow and look at how
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.760]   and why Christians who float in the Christian life
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   will actually drift.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.720]   The sobering warning from John Piper,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.360]   drawn from 2 Peter 1, verses 5 through 11,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.840]   a very necessary warning we need to hear.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.680]   That's tomorrow.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.080]   I'll see you then.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
