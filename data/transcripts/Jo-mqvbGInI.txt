[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   [music]
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.560]   Pastor John, let's talk about the Puritans and personal holiness.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.440]   One of the great points that they see in Scripture is this connection between
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   happiness and holiness, and they obviously developed this in
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.840]   their theology of who God is. His happiness and his holiness are all
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.240]   interconnected. And then they worked that out in the
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   Christian life so that in the end, to be perfectly holy would be to be
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.720]   perfectly happy. Pastor John, how would you
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.160]   articulate this connection between happiness and holiness?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.080]   I'm going to come at it a little differently, because
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.520]   the longer I have thought about Christian hedonism,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.840]   and God being most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.400]   the more careful I have become in talking about the relationship that
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.880]   way. And here's what usually doesn't get
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.920]   said when that relationship between holiness
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   and happiness is being described. I think happiness is part of
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.000]   holiness. So that if you try to describe for me what it means to be a holy
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   person, leaving out happiness in God,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.240]   so that I will, in response to that holiness, become happy in God,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   you can't do it. You can't do it. There is no such thing as
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   holiness minus happiness in God. Happiness in God is the, I'll risk it,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.680]   essence of holiness. So step back and let me define
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.120]   my understanding of what God's holiness is.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.360]   And we had a whole conference on holiness and sanctification here
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.280]   last year, and I tried to develop this, but I think God's holiness
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.160]   is God's supreme value, being supremely valuable, the most
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.640]   glorious, valuable, precious being in the universe, and His acting
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.520]   in ways that accord with that supreme value. That's His holiness.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.560]   So God infinitely delights in His infinite delightfulness, because
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   otherwise He'd be a liar. He'd be unrighteous. And so His holiness
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.320]   is being infinitely delightful and delighting infinitely in His infinite
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   delightfulness. That's His holiness. Now our holiness
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.480]   is then seeing and agreeing with and treasuring
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   that. That we see God as infinitely valuable,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680]   infinitely precious, infinitely worthy of trust and delight and admiration and
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.600]   praise, and we not only see it, but we savor it,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.120]   we trust it, we treasure it, we embrace it, we
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.400]   enjoy it, we're satisfied by it, and we act in accordance with our
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   esteeming Jesus above all things. And that's our holiness, which means once
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   you set things up like that, oh, you've just defined the essence
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.000]   of holiness as seeing God as infinitely valuable and
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920]   savoring God as infinitely valuable, and then everything flows from
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.040]   that. But now your question still is valid because there is--
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.640]   happiness is like a spiral in the Christian life, I think.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   You see God, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." So you
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.000]   see God and you're blessed by it. You're blessed
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.320]   by that beatific vision, especially in Christ, in the cross, loving you, dying
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.600]   for you, rising for you. You see that, and joy
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.480]   floods your soul because of what you see of God.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.520]   That seeing enables you then to do things that God says we ought to do,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.200]   like love your enemy. When you love your enemy,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.560]   that fruit circles back and makes you happy. There's a
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.040]   happiness of conscience that when you-- what is Paul saying in
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.120]   Romans 14? "Blessed is the man who does what he has nothing against." He
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.680]   only does what his conscience doesn't command.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.560]   So when you lay down your head at night, having acted in ways that your
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.480]   satisfaction in God has enabled you to do, there is another level of happiness
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.080]   that comes, a kind of a circling or a spiraling up
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.000]   of happiness, and that happiness then increases your
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.760]   your joy in God, and that frees you to do more acts of love,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.960]   and that makes you happier. When we say God is most glorified in you
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.880]   when you are most satisfied in Him, we are saying, therefore, the
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.240]   essential warfare of holiness or sanctification
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.440]   is the warfare to be satisfied in God. It's a fight to see Him as beautiful
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.480]   and to savor Him as beautiful. That is the
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.840]   number one fight. So if you take pornography, or theft, or
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.640]   desire for applause, any of those sins, the fundamental way that you sever the
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.040]   root of those sins is by striving for
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   the power of a superior satisfaction, namely in God. Thank you, Pastor John.
