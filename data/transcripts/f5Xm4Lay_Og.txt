[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Well, should we study catechisms or memorize scripture?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.160]   It's a really good question that comes to us
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.040]   from a listener named Sarah in North Carolina.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.480]   Pastor John, I'm a stay-at-home mom
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.600]   with three young children.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.580]   We currently homeschool, and I love the opportunities
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.560]   the kids and I have multiple times a day
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.480]   to talk about the glory of God
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.780]   in our adventures and education.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.900]   It truly is a joy to point them to Christ every day.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.040]   My question is this, what are your thoughts
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.360]   on teaching children a catechism?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.880]   Is it worth the huge amount of time
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.200]   that we would spend on it,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.780]   or would our time be better served
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.640]   only in memorizing scripture that points to the same truth?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.160]   Pastor John, what would you say to Sarah?
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540]   - Well, it sounds like a wonderful home to grow up in.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.440]   Talking about the glory of God
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.080]   and concerned about whether scripture,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.480]   memory, or catechism is to be chosen.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.000]   When we think about the time
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600]   that we have with our children,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000]   and I'm talking about a family
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.160]   where a child's born, grows up, goes away to school.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.680]   There are other kinds of families,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800]   but let's just address this one.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.280]   When we think about that time with our children,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   we need to be realistic and remember
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.020]   that Bible memory and catechism could start
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020]   about age two, say, or three,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.920]   until they leave at about 18.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.480]   And so we've got roughly 15 years.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   So when I pose myself the question,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.480]   catechism versus Bible memory,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.800]   I say, there's plenty of time here.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.000]   We can do this.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We can do both of these.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.960]   This is not an either or.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.000]   So my encouragement to all families
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.480]   is that they definitely read the Bible together every day.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.160]   Real scripture, real reading, real discussion,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.440]   real prayer from the heart,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.800]   connected with real life every day.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.160]   Yes, Bible has priority.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.080]   The question is, what's the role of a catechism
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.520]   in that process of Bible saturation?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   And I would describe the role of the catechism
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   in four words, interpretation, selection,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.600]   organization, and completeness.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.560]   And here's what I mean briefly.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400]   A catechism is tremendously valuable
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   by providing overall interpretation
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.760]   for the sweep of scripture.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   We all need the particularities of texts.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.720]   Yes, we do.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.600]   I need concrete texts in my mind
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.360]   in order to fight the fight of faith.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   But we also need a sense of what those texts mean
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   in the larger picture.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.740]   And catechisms are one means that God,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.360]   over the centuries, has brought about
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880]   through the wisdom of the church,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.240]   which he's given, to provide interpretation
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   for how the texts fit together
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.720]   in a larger, coherent meaning.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   Second, catechisms provide help
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   in selecting what things in scripture to prioritize.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.280]   There's thousands and thousands of verses in the Bible,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.440]   like 31,000 plus.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.560]   Most of us need some help in knowing
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.200]   which of these 31,000 verses are most important
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.900]   for knowing God and living a life of faithfulness.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.680]   Catechisms are the distillation,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640]   the collective wisdom of the church
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.780]   as to what parts of the Bible need to be emphasized
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.000]   for the health of believers.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.360]   Third, it really helps the mind of a child,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.900]   and adults, I would say,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.640]   to have the vast array of ideas in the Bible
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   brought into some sense of organization.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.160]   What is foundational?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.120]   What's built on the foundation?
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.380]   Where's it all going?
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.440]   Some kind of flow, some kind of order.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   Our children can be left in a great confusion
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.720]   if they only learn random Bible verses,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.080]   'cause that's 10,000 times better than not learning them.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960]   But they can be left in some confusion
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.240]   if they just learn random Bible verses
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.480]   that are never brought into any particular order
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.640]   or sequence or progression of thought,
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.420]   and catechisms are a great help in this.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.560]   And the last function, I would say,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.000]   is the idea of comprehensiveness or completeness.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.480]   And here's what I have in mind.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   When Paul addressed the elders of Ephesus in Acts 20,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   he said their blood wasn't on his hands
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.920]   because he had not failed
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.000]   to deliver the whole counsel of God.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.800]   He uses the phrase in Romans 6.17
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   that you have all received a type of teaching,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.360]   or even clearer, in 1 Timothy 6, verse 20,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.000]   he talks about the good deposit
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.840]   that Timothy should deliver to the people.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.040]   So you got these phrases, whole counsel of God,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.080]   type of teaching, good deposit,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   all of them suggesting that in the bigness
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.040]   and detail of the Bible,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   there is a core, unified, comprehensive body of truth
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.680]   that we need to make sure,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.840]   as a pastor we deliver to our churches,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.600]   as parents we deliver to our children.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.560]   And I think catechisms are an effort,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.480]   no doubt not perfect,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.240]   an effort to try to fulfill that mission.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.040]   So what I'm saying is don't neglect the Bible reading
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.100]   and don't neglect Bible memory,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.840]   but somewhere along the way in those 15 years,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.240]   build the catechism into your instruction.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.120]   Maybe she's thinking,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.800]   oh, you got to do catechism all of those 15 years.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.840]   Oh, no, no, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   Noel and I used a catechism for our kids some years
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.300]   and not other years, some school years.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.080]   That's what we did mainly in the evening.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.120]   We did it twice at least,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.160]   a little simple one and then a more complicated one.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.280]   So I'm not saying it has to have a big part of every day,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.060]   of every year of a child's life.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.320]   Just somewhere along the way that gets built in.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.960]   And I would just mention in closing
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.640]   a few catechisms to think about.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.360]   The Westminster Shorter Catechism
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.640]   from the Reformed Presbyterian Tradition,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.160]   the Baptist Catechism that I adapted,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.440]   and that's at, I checked,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   it's at the Desiring God website,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.480]   118 questions that I adjusted and put my comments on.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.740]   So that's available for free.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.520]   There's a little simple one,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   a child's catechism I think it's called
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.960]   or something like that.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.760]   It's a little yellow book
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.860]   and it has like two or three word answers
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.940]   for little tiny kids, you know?
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.800]   Like who is God?
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.100]   Little tiny answers.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.980]   And we used that very early for Talith
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.640]   and shifted over.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.680]   And then more recently there's the New City Catechism
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.260]   that's promoted at the Gospel Coalition website
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.240]   and it's got its own website.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.560]   Just type in New City Catechism and you'll find it.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's got video helps and lots of things online.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.240]   So that's a good one too.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.360]   So my answer basically is not either or, both and.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.880]   - Excellent, great strategy, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.120]   And I should note that the New City Catechism
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.320]   and this app, which is really excellent,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.120]   it's both adaptable for little kids too.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.320]   So the whole project,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.560]   what they've done with the New City Catechism
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.320]   is pretty impressive for its flexibility
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.480]   to serve really any age demographic.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.040]   So grateful to TGC and for their work in it.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.560]   And if you want links to those catechisms,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.040]   you can find the transcript of this episode
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.720]   at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.400]   There we host the full manuscripts

[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.680]   along with links to resources
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   that are mentioned in each episode.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.060]   You can find all those links in those manuscripts.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.080]   Well, on Friday we're gonna talk about
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   Bible translation and missions and literacy
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.640]   in the realm of frontier missions.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.040]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.200]   I'll see you on Friday.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.360]   (upbeat music)
