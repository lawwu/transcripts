[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Hi, friends. Welcome back to another episode of The Everyday Educator. We are so excited
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.760]   that you're here with us today. And this time, we're going to be talking all about our homeschool
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.140]   routines. We know that getting in a rhythm, especially at the beginning of the school
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.400]   year, can be tricky. And so we've got some moms in every stage of the homeschooling journey
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.680]   who are excited to share their thoughts and what is going on in their lives right now.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.840]   As it regards to homeschool routines. If you have found us and you're not a part of Classical
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.000]   Conversations in a community, we would really encourage you to go and find a community because
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.980]   this is a great place for you to be encouraged. But the best place for you to get the encouragement
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.820]   that you need is actually shoulder to shoulder in a community with other homeschooling families.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.000]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you. Well, ladies, welcome to the
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.960]   show. Today, I've got Emily Phillip and Lisa Bailey. Emily, welcome.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.860]   Hi, thanks. Thanks for having me. If you guys don't know Emily from the Blessings and Motherhood
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.580]   episode that we did with her a couple of months ago, definitely go and listen to it. We will link
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.320]   it in the show notes for you. She is fantastic. Wealth of knowledge. But just in case they don't go
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.580]   listen to it, would you introduce yourself to our listeners? Just give us a snapshot of your family
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.180]   and your life.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.320]   Yes. And actually, we recorded that like almost a year ago. So I get to like update all the numbers.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.880]   Okay. So my numbers are, this will be my 11th year of CC, my ninth year directing, and I've been doing
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   Foundations Essentials that whole time. Love it. And so I have four kiddos. The oldest is going into
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.100]   Challenge 2 boy. Okay. So I've got three boys and a girl. Oldest is going into Challenge 2,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.240]   Challenge A, second year of Essentials. So he's Foundations and Essentials. And then my daughter
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   has one more year of only Foundations. So that's 15, 12, 10, and 8. That's super, super fun. And my
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.100]   husband works from home. So our house is just our base of everything. Life, everything. Yeah. Our walls are
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.080]   dinged up. They look nasty, but we're like some other season of life. That's right. That's right.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.880]   You are where you're supposed to be. We live in this house hard. That's right. That's right. And in
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.840]   every room, probably. That's right. Our school room is now our dining room, which is an update from a
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.460]   year ago. We moved into the dining room. Yeah. Nice. Well, I'm excited to hear more about that too.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.280]   Lisa, where did you guys homeschool when you were raising your girls? Was it a separate room?
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.080]   Oh, well, we lived in a very small house when we had very small children. And so we did not have
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.120]   any extra rooms. My husband, Emily, also worked from home. He's a pastor. And so the only extra room
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.560]   that we had was daddy's office because he did need a place to go where he could shut the door and be in
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.420]   the quiet. And so we had an eat-in kitchen. We did not have a separate dining room. And so we schooled
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.900]   at the table and there was a shelf along the wall. And, but each girl had a bin of school supplies
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.580]   and mama had a shelf of curriculum. Um, and we had, we had on the back of the kitchen cabinets,
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.660]   we had our big whiteboard and on the wall, we had our big map and we were up close and personal with
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.100]   all of our school work all the time. And it was great. It was fine.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.600]   Yeah. I think a lot of people are in your situation. Yeah. I think that is super, super common.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.900]   Yeah. Yeah. We were blessed. We, um, right at the beginning of our homeschool journey,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.180]   we moved, um, in the area. And so we were able to say, we want a house that can have a homeschool
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.560]   room that has an extra room for homeschool. And it was before all the real estate went crazy.
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.260]   So we could actually afford that. So we're, we're super, yeah, super blessed.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.300]   We were blessed after the girls were, um, I guess Stephanie was in challenge one and Sarah was
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.740]   in challenge a, when we moved to the house where we live now. And, um, it was a huge blessing. We had
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.420]   an upstairs and a downstairs and the downstairs has this big room that we converted half of
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:31.260]   to a big long, um, station. It was a big counter that we built with leftover materials, but it was
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.500]   a counter and they each had a computer station and a desk station and flanking bookcases. And that was
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.600]   really suitable for challenge. And then we had a table off to the side where when mom, when you have
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.060]   to sit with mom and do the check-in or when you and mom are doing chemistry or you and mom are doing
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.860]   advanced math, there was a space for that. So we were blessed. We, so I know what it is to be in both
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.480]   of those situations and they were both glorious. So. Yeah. It's definitely fun to explore, you know,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.120]   since I was homeschooled through high school, I have the reference of only what I've experienced.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.480]   So it's a totally different thing when you're like, okay, now it's my turn. What am I going to do?
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.740]   Like, what are the things that I've seen us do? Right. Our different houses growing up. What are
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.800]   we going to do? Right now we're mostly at the table, but I do find myself like defaulting to what I'm used
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.840]   to, which I think is a good, good way for us to get into this routine conversation today. Um, because
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.740]   there is a way that your life works naturally. Like I'm a bucket person, for example. So we've got right
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.200]   behind me. I could touch it. There's the school bin where this is the stuff I use daily. And there's
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.060]   the thing I don't want to forget that lives on the table. This is my kitchen table. And then what I'm
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.900]   used to is actually bookshelves in a separate room. So all the rest of my school supplies, it's not even
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.900]   in the room where we do school. So I'm just finding myself trying to reconcile these two things, like
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.840]   what's natural in me and what I was taught and which one works better. Um, and today, you know,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.800]   like I said, we're going to talk about routine. So I would love to know so that everyone knows who
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.900]   is speaking to them. Are you guys routines people? Would you call yourself a routine person, Emily?
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.440]   Yes, very much. So anyone who knows me would be like, yes, she is. I am all about some routines.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.200]   What about you, Lisa? Oh, yes. People would laugh. You know, if people were listening to this now,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.580]   they were like, oh, yeah, I mean, there's no, I have a plan. Um, I have a planner and I have a plan
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.280]   and I like a list. I'm the list woman. I have a book of lists. And, um, so yeah, I have always been,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.000]   it is comforting to me. Okay. So it's not so much that I demand that everything be in a routine.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.340]   That is comforting to me. Like I know what to expect. And especially the more plates you have
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.020]   to spin, the more you have to know which plate is ready to be touched at which time. And so that
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.960]   is just sort of how routine helps me not drop a plate. Not as often anyway. Totally agree with that.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.560]   Yeah. I couldn't agree with you more. And as a person who, maybe this is a pride thing. Like I never
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.580]   wanted to be described as a type A, even though people constantly describe me as type A, as a person
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.640]   who doesn't subscribe to that thinking. I do often find myself falling into those things because I
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.360]   don't know another effective way to keep the plate spinning. You know, I'm a full-time stay-at-home
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.080]   working mom. What is that? Right. That's the only way that you can do it. But even when I wasn't,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.220]   even when I was younger and, you know, either trying to organize my schoolwork or in college,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.480]   working through college, there's never been a time in my life where I didn't need the structure
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.880]   to survive. So if you are a person who doesn't need that structure to survive, we commend you. And
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:15.700]   I mean, everybody might not have a schedule, but everybody has a rhythm. You know, the more,
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.940]   the deeper you have a conversation with somebody, the more you hear, well, we don't really have a
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.980]   schedule, but we do. And then they start telling you the thing. It doesn't have a time attached to it,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:34.280]   it's almost always the same order or the same general time of the day or the same people are
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:41.200]   doing the same kinds of things. And so, yeah, I think that rhythm is better than schedule for
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.360]   describing most of what we all do. And I do think people can grow in it, especially just to survive
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.820]   certain seasons of life, not survive. I shouldn't say survive to thrive in certain seasons of life.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:01.020]   I think that everyone can grow in it. And actually it's funny because I am so routine oriented that I,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:10.240]   my learning and stretching is where I can ease up and be less regimented. So we all have things to learn.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.700]   What, Emily, you said, okay, so what kind of routines or schedules, if you want to say it,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:24.500]   help your family the most? Because almost, well, I have some, I have some personal thoughts about what
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.380]   people in general need, but, but what kind of routines help your family?
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:34.700]   Well, I guess I should, I can start off by saying, so I've got four kids, the youngest of which is eight,
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:40.620]   and they're all very sporty. So we do a lot of sports. So I would say during the school year,
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.140]   our evenings are almost all full. They're either full of sports or church activities,
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:50.000]   or we've all do trail life and American heritage girls love those programs.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.460]   So between all of those things, we are literally out of the house almost every evening of the week.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.840]   So my routines and our schedules and our rhythms have to do with accomplishing school so that we can
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.040]   be out of the house in the evening and not feeling like we didn't get things done that we needed to
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:21.200]   get done. So I, I have always had routines, even from when they were babies, like when we get up,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.820]   we get dressed, right? Just really simple things like that. We go, we go ahead and brush our teeth
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.280]   before we come downstairs, even though we haven't eaten yet, we're just going to go ahead and get
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   it done. And a lot of the, a lot of the scheduling and the things that go on in my brain and routines
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.700]   that I put in place for my family are, are to ease my own brain. Cause my own brain feels so full,
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.280]   especially with also directing, which is such a wonderful, I love directing and I love,
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:54.220]   um, you know, sacrificing my time and energy for my community because I love my community and I love
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.620]   this curriculum and I want it for my kids. So I'm super motivated to help make sure our community is
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.480]   healthy, but that takes a lot of my time. So I've got that going on in my head. I've got all the sports
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.060]   going on in my head and I've got all the school going on in my head and I'm trying to be a good wife,
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.240]   you know, and, and now I've started like baking my own bread and doing weird stuff like that.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.840]   All this stuff swirling around in my head. And so just so that we can thrive and not feel like
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.740]   we're drowning. Yeah. I have to put routines in place. Um, I don't know if I've gotten around to
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.900]   answering your question exactly, but, um, I don't know how nitty nitty gritty you want to get to at
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.200]   this moment. Definitely. Well, what I'm hearing you say is that most of your routines are either
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:41.020]   triggered by one action. So it's like this, it's like a domino effect or it's triggered by the goal
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:47.820]   of finishing school in time for X, which for me, I really resonate with that because I was thinking,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:53.740]   how do I describe our, our days are extremely structured because I do work full time. Um,
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.540]   and so that's been a gift to me. There was a time I said, Lord, why does everything have to be on a
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:08.740]   calendar? He said, you need this. You're going to find out you need this. Even if you didn't want
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:15.140]   this, you need everything to be structured in your life. And if, you know, my son is very routine. So
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.700]   that's the other reason why things ended up when in that season of my life, he needed his nap time to
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.740]   be at a very specific time. I thought that I could just do whatever I wanted. Well, he's not that kid.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:32.640]   So some kids are, but all that to say for us, it's attached to flags in my day is what I call them.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.960]   Yeah. So I have these markers that initiate a different rhythm, but those flags are kind of
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.640]   like pillars that keep the day structured. Yes. And most of them around either food or rest,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.300]   you know, especially when you have a little one, because that those are the two driving forces for a
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.260]   preschooler. Exactly. So it's either what happens before breakfast, you know, have we done all the
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:04.840]   before breakfast things? What happens after and before lunch? And then what happens before dinner
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.180]   and bed, you know? But Lisa, I'm also curious to hear from you because I'm sure your rhythms have
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.300]   changed over the years, but do you see a pattern? And what helped you when it comes to structure?
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:29.080]   Well, I am like you guys in that when my girls were little, I discovered that routine was our friend
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:38.140]   because children actually, most children thrive in a routine because even before they can verbalize,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:47.600]   they can normalize what a routine is. And so they know what to expect of their day and their
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.480]   surroundings. And they, I think it helps them have some control and some security, you know, everything,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:02.360]   this may look different, but I know that when I get up, this is what I do. And I know that
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:09.880]   this is when we usually eat. And I know that this is when we rest. And I know that this is the time
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:18.080]   when I will leave mama alone and play by myself and we'll all be happier, you know? And so that was
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.240]   great. And we homeschooled kind of like you, Denise, there were, there were flags. So like, okay, if it is
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:32.940]   getting to be 830, then we need to be moving on toward our family devotion or we won't get finished,
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.180]   you know? So it wasn't a hard and fast. I wasn't just looking at the clock saying, okay, now it's time
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:46.760]   to put this away. But there was a rhythm and a flow when they were little. But then I think as your
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:54.600]   children get older, especially as they move toward an end to challenge, that you have to,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.340]   well, you really do want to be working yourself out of a job. You really don't. My kids, when they
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.980]   were really little, they said, are you going to homeschool college us? And I'm like, that would be
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.340]   no. And thank you for wanting that. There will come a time, I promise you that you will not desire
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.660]   that. And we'll both be on the same page. And of course they didn't when they got to high school,
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:26.880]   but I wanted them to have a sense of how to set their own rhythm and their own schedule,
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.480]   because I wasn't going to college with them and I wanted them to know how to do it. And so we began
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:41.580]   to give them more autonomy, you know, not enough to hang themselves with, but enough to get tangled up
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:47.240]   and need to be rescued. And then that was my goal. That was my cue to step in and say, okay,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.980]   so how did it go off the rails? Where do you, where was the last time you felt like you had a handle on
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.100]   this? And how did it get screwed up? And how can we fix it? How can I be your partner? How can we fix
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.660]   it? And so what do you think would help you next time? And then as they got older and more verbal,
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:10.000]   I also discovered that my two girls, this is God's sense of humor. If you have two children,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.080]   they'll, they won't be alike. And so they had very different rhythms of work. I had one that would
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.340]   wake up early and she liked to get it all done and be done. And then one, especially as she approached
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:29.720]   the challenge years that she liked to get up later and she did not mind if she had to work into the
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:37.000]   evening. And so while that was not my personality, my personality was let's get her done because
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.580]   my husband's a pastor. I almost always had minister responsibilities in the evening and I really didn't
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:49.000]   want anybody to still be doing schoolwork because then I felt like I was still doing school. But I had
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.540]   to just kind of turn loose of that and say, okay, I mean, let's see how it goes. It was always that way.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:02.160]   Let's see how it goes. As long as you don't get really annoyed that your sister is done and you
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:10.180]   are not, then I'm okay with that. Cause we quickly got to a point where we started making a sort of
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:16.240]   schedule for them because then it became, if we made the schedule together, I could say,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:22.040]   like one of them could say, can I be done for the day? Cause you know, you do have days when you just
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:28.520]   want to be done. But when you're in challenge, there are things that need to be finished in order for you
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:38.320]   to be a good community member. And so I could say, what does your schedule say? And, and she knew that she
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.580]   had helped to make the schedule and she knew what it took. And so she would say, well, my schedule says,
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:50.440]   I need to finish this part of the nature journal today. And I said, well, then I guess you're not
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:58.360]   finished, but that puts some of the responsibility there. So I was not the mean mama. It was a schedule
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:05.480]   that we made together. So that's big. Hey everyone. We want to interrupt this show to tell you more
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.720]   about this semester's sponsor, Judson College. Judson College is an amazing fit for a CC student
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.860]   because they really do focus in on our three uniques, classical, Christian, and community.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:25.100]   Listen to their mission statement. They say, equipping students to give their lives for the cause of Christ
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:31.740]   in the church, among the nations, and in every aspect of society. Let me tell you a little bit about
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.880]   what they mean when they say every aspect of society. I know sometimes we think of a Christian
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.940]   college and we think, okay, you're just teaching me to go into vocational ministry. Well, guess what?
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.680]   We spoke with a representative from Judson College and he shared with us that it's more than just
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:52.460]   official ministry. They believe that every believer is equipped and needs to be equipped for ministry
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:58.640]   wherever their feet land. So whether that means the marketplace or someone's church. Judson College
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.480]   has a wide variety of degrees for students to choose from, including 25 majors, as well as five years
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.400]   bachelor's to master's programs. And each of these programs are taught by exceptional faculty who are
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.340]   experts in their field and passionate about investing in the lives of their students. They want their
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.940]   students to leave equipped theologically and professionally for whatever career God wants them to pursue.

[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.040]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:41.980]   Emily, I'm guessing you're probably right in the middle of what Lisa's describing because you have kids
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.780]   straddling those ages. What does that look like for you right now to help them have some autonomy?
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.340]   Yes. Well, it's interesting, Lisa, what you were describing, like letting them work into the
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:58.060]   evening, if that's, you know, but I, what I was thinking in my own head was I could only do that
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:04.020]   if, you know, first of all, if we didn't have evening activities. Second of all, I think what I would do
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.160]   just for my own brain is I would say, you need to make sure that you have accomplished the things that
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.180]   you might need me for before three o'clock or something like that. And then after that, you are
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:21.020]   more than welcome to order until 10 o'clock. I do not care, but you can't need me. I am going to be
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.780]   done being teacher mom at three o'clock. That would be what I know I would need for my own brain.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.920]   That's really smart. And there, and even into the challenge years, we continued to have a weekly
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.560]   meet in where I had to see the schedule because what I discovered as early challenge people,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:45.180]   they were like way ambitious and they would make these things just like, well, we have 35 pages of
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:51.620]   Latin in it and we have seven days so we can do five pages a day. And I'm like, okay, so A, you're not
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:55.920]   going to work on seven days because I know, and you know, we're not doing school on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:03.880]   And B, some of those five pages are nothing but a picture and some text and no exercises. So every
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:11.560]   page of Latin is not created equal. So let's first of all, just not plan to fail. So yes, we had to get
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:17.240]   to the point where we had to be realistic about the schedule. And I love that. And I had dancer girls,
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.040]   dancer and soccer girls. And so they knew, okay, don't, don't tell me that you're going to work from
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.060]   eight to 10. If you have dance from seven 30 to nine 30, cause that's not going to work.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:37.340]   Right. Let's all be real. Totally. Totally. So my challenge. So, and actually it's funny. I think
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.780]   that, I don't know that it funny is the right word. I do think something happens in the challenge years
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:49.340]   where a lot of times the moms are like, I've made it. Yes, you're off. And we forget that we really do
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:55.780]   need to continue to check in really all the way because we're still responsible. Like, okay. I'm,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:01.500]   I can't take credit for this charity minor who is on Instagram at a note for the future has always said
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:09.320]   you need to inspect what you expect. And that goes all the way through challenge four. So really there
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.620]   is no point at which we should be never checking in with them. So one of the ways that I check in with
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:21.680]   my, um, he's about to be challenged to student is, um, on day one. So I would say, you know,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:27.320]   it for challenge day five would be your community day. So on day one, he has already written his plan.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:33.200]   We learned to write our, he writes his plan for the week before day one, he writes it the evening
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.860]   before so that we're ready to roll. That, that was a, that was a game changer last year when somebody
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:44.500]   recommended that. Um, so I check over this day. Oh my goodness. Especially for those half a day for
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.760]   the toddlers. And our day one is Monday. So, you know, like getting back going for the week and you
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.360]   got to make your plan. Yes. So I check over the plan. We go through the email from the director
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.800]   together. A lot of directors email, they don't all, but we go through it. We make sure like everything's
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:07.640]   on there and then he rolls for the week. And then ideally I check back over his work the night before
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.280]   he goes to class or like the afternoon. And there have been many times where I'm like, where's this
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.820]   thing? And he'd be like, Oh, so really like, even though they've got it written down, even though they
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.980]   made the plan there, things fall through the cracks. And that is why we need to be there to be checking.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:28.540]   And also to say like, does the paper he wrote meet my expectations? Like, right. Or did he just
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:35.200]   check the box this week? So we really, we need to make sure we're continuing to inspect what we expect.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.840]   Thank you, charity minor for that wonderful phrase. Um, but I also, I also want to take this opportunity
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.060]   to just encourage challenge mamas to, I'm going to reiterate or add to what Lisa is saying. It really
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:54.280]   is a life skill to learn how to make a schedule. And these challenge years are such a, and the
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.360]   challenge workload is such a great opportunity for the kids to learn that. So I know there's lots of
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.540]   great plans out there for like, it'll break down all of the challenge, a work for you and tells you
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.820]   exactly what to do every day. I encourage people not to use those. Yeah, I know. Like maybe you've got
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.140]   a weird year, like, or maybe there's sickness or something like that and you need it. That's great.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.520]   But as a general rule for the average student, I would say, please don't use those because you
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.440]   want to teach your kids how to look at their own schedule, consider their own personality,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:31.140]   the things they love and don't love. Like one lesson that my son learned in challenge eight,
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.440]   he would save his least favorite things to the end of the day.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.580]   I know you got to do that at the first cranky all day, right?
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.440]   Cause we finally hanging over his head. So when we finally figured that I was like, dude,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.420]   you need to do the stuff you hate first, get her done. Not that he hates any bit of
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.340]   challenge. He loves it, but no, of course, you love in part. You don't love as much.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:01.280]   So that was a huge revelation. And then also like you were saying, like sometimes they might put
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.080]   just an inappropriate amount of stuff. I don't know, but they get better at that. And so they get
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.920]   better at it and figuring out like what works for them, how fast are they, how slow are they,
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.900]   what are they slower on because they don't like it as much or faster on because they really like it.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.880]   And they learn to make their schedule. It's beautiful.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.700]   It is really beautiful, but you know what? Sometimes they really don't do a good job of it.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.880]   And sometimes they intentionally don't do a good job of it. And sometimes they really
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:36.800]   just missed the mark. Like I had no idea it would take me X number of hours to do this. And so
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:46.340]   it is such a great opportunity to model grace and say to them, you know what? Yeah, bud, that is really
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:53.240]   hard. I can see that you never had an assignment quite like that before. And I sort of wondered if
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.040]   you were going to get it, but I decided to let you try. But here I feel your pain. I know you feel bad.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.540]   I can tell you feel bad about it. And I know you don't want to go into class. Let me help you.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:11.060]   Let's do a plan B. What can we do? What's the end around? And then help them over. I mean,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:17.420]   they fell in the ditch. Here's the good thing. They fell in the ditch while you were still in
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:23.800]   the neighborhood. So you can rescue them. It's not like they fell in the ditch at college or when
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:30.320]   they're half a country away in a job. Teach them how to fall in the ditch. Show them the grace to
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:36.160]   write the car. But then sometime the next week, have a deeper conversation. Okay, so
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.740]   what did we learn from that? All right. So how are we going to know to turn the wheel before we land in
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:49.580]   the ditch again? And when do you need to ask for help? And that's okay. They're just teenagers.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.400]   My life is a perfect example of what you guys are describing. Because I've never known anything
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:01.480]   else but homeschooling, right? So what you're describing is my story and a huge reason why
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.660]   I felt like it was so worthwhile. And it's funny when you see it from when you look retrospectively
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:13.920]   on your life, right? You see it through your adult eyes. But that was it. And there were multiple times
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.260]   things through our journey. And I know this is very common, which is the other reason I'm saying
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.980]   it, where I would say to my mom, what if I went to school? You know, because I'm the third of four
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.340]   children. What if I went to school? What would that look like? And you know how we landed on the fact
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:34.060]   that that didn't make sense for me? Because of the schedule. Because I would, my mom would say,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:41.080]   okay, show me how that would make sense for you, little girl who does and is the worship leader at
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.460]   church and works and homeschools and has her co-op day and et cetera. And she would say, sure,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:53.080]   just show me. And I would go through my schedule and conclude that I didn't want as much time
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.160]   caught up in a classroom when I knew that when I get my biology done is at 10 p.m. But when I get my
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.780]   math done is at 8 a.m. with my mom, and I just had my schedule set up in such a way that I could
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:11.200]   thrive in life. But I never would have known that about myself had I not been given the autonomy and
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.240]   trained how to create a schedule. So I just wanted to put that out there in case people were like,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:22.260]   oh, is this too hard for kids? It is difficult. However, it might help you with challenging parenting
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:28.920]   things if they know what it takes for them to live a life that they love. And I loved it. And
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.540]   therefore, I want to give my children what I was given. But I don't think I would have
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:40.400]   been able to draw that conclusion had I not worked through the scheduling part as well as the scholastic
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.680]   part. So I just want to put that out there. That's really smart. Yeah. That's really good. That's
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:54.400]   really good. And when you asked me the question, you said, how did your rhythm change? And it is
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   different. I mean, with younger children, like pre-challenged kids, you probably are setting the
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:08.180]   schedule for them because you do a lot of them. And here's the deal. People might think that everything
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:15.980]   in life revolves around children, but it shouldn't. And so there are other responsibilities that mamas have,
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:21.620]   that mamas and daddies have. And so they need their, when they're young, their schooling needs to follow
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:29.100]   your, not that you don't take their personal rhythms into account. And if they really can't wake up at
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:35.820]   eight o'clock, then maybe you guys start school at nine 30 and that's fine. But, but it does change,
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:43.700]   you know, the schedules that we make for little kids may become the rhythms that our older children
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.700]   follow. Um, so it is different for littles, middles and olders.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.920]   Mm-hmm. And I wanted to add to the discussion about the olders that, you know, as they're making,
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.040]   learning to make their own schedule, it's a good opportunity to let some natural consequences happen.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:04.760]   Yes. You know, to let them feel it. Yeah. Sometimes it does. Like sometimes they might need to miss
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.040]   their sports for that evening or their whatever, if they made a poor choice, you know, you don't have
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:16.900]   to beat them over the head with it. You just let it happen. And maybe when it's dust is settled,
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.640]   you can say, well, how can we prevent this from happening? Right. Yeah. That was sad. And I know you
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:28.060]   hated to miss it. I appreciate that, you know, you took responsibility for the work of being a good
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.760]   community member and you got your stuff done, but let's not let it happen again. What could we do?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.620]   Yeah. That's really smart, Emily. I love it. Very good. Well, I know this show is called Everyday
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.140]   Educator and we really do believe that learning is a lifestyle. It's not just something that we say.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:51.920]   So sometimes I find that people challenge, they find it challenging to wrap their minds around
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:59.140]   what is school, what is a part of our routine and what is not. So I thought maybe we could expand this
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:06.700]   conversation even beyond getting the academics done into things like chores or, you know, Bible study,
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.940]   just all of the things that happen in your day, because of course it's all centered around God.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.360]   Um, so what did you guys do for chores or what are you doing right now for chores? Do you consider
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.520]   that to be a part of your official homeschooling, Emily? I mean, it's, it's a part of our life is
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.120]   chores. And the thing about scheduling and routines is they do change so, so much. I know we've already
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.660]   established that. That's why we're all in different stages here on the same podcast to kind of
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.660]   demonstrate that, but it really does change so much. And so chores is one of those things that I'm
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.940]   constantly kind of reevaluating, like, how can I make this work? It's, it worked for a while and it
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:51.660]   doesn't work anymore. But, um, one thing that has worked for years for us is we have Saturday chores
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:58.380]   and that's when they, all the kids and it's age appropriate. And we've shuffled the different chores
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.060]   around some over the years, but they do the big chores, like the vacuuming of the house, the cleaning
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:08.880]   of the bathrooms, the, um, indexing of the windows, the washing the floors, that those things, they all
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.740]   have their things and they have to accomplish all of that before they have their weekend screen time.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:21.560]   So we, we limit screen time to the weekends. And so they're, my kids are highly motivated by
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:27.220]   screen time. So they, they do their chores, but they also, this is, this is something that surprises
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:33.360]   some people. My kids have done their own laundry since they were five. My daughter has been doing it
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.960]   since she was about three. So we do have front loading machines, but I, I tell you, I think even if our
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.820]   front loader craps out and we get a top loader, I would just get a step stool and a grabber.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:50.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It does work beautifully, but they take care of their own laundry. So they each
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.020]   have a day that they do their laundry and that's a chore every week that they do. And also I, I don't
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.980]   care how they fold. I just, they need to get into the drawers. It needs to get somewhere. They can
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.660]   stuff them in. I do not care. We don't separate colors. I know some people that are like their minds
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:12.120]   are blowing right now, but not just everything in one load. We don't buy clothes that are,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.740]   that are so fussy that we need to pull them out because of this, I want my kids to be able to do
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.400]   their own laundry. Right. And they wash them and then they stuff them back in their drawers. They
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   get 24 hours to complete that cycle. And it is wonderful. Will you bring that down? For those
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.100]   younger girls in the room, I haven't, I have an idea of what you could have done. This is one of my
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:40.500]   goals for Leo next year. Okay. Okay. There'll be four in the fall. Yeah. How did you train it?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.960]   That's what I want to know. How did you? Yeah. Cause that's earlier than I did it. So yeah,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.420]   let me, let me hear it. So everybody has their own laundry basket in their own rooms. That's one thing
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.680]   they're collecting their own laundry all week and having it also be like the same day of the week means
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.820]   that I know you only need eight pairs of undies, you know, like one extra because you're going to do it
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.900]   every week. And that, so it really helps me know how many, how many pairs of clothes they need also.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.780]   But so on that day of the week, sometime in the morning, I used to have to remind them that they
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:16.020]   pretty much all remember at this point. They, so how do you train them? I, you said, I would walk in
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:22.180]   there with them with their laundry basket, you know, help them shove it in, show them how. So for a lot
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:28.320]   of years I would have to do the soap. They'd be like, mom, so because they couldn't manage the giant
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:36.500]   jug. Um, they can all do that now. So they put the soap in, they start. So, Oh, I had, um, I had cut
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.760]   out little arrows and taped them to the thing. So these are the buttons that you push. And if there would
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.800]   have been a specific order, I would have numbered them. There wasn't, there's not a specific order on
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.860]   mine. So I had, you know, the stickers, they know all that now, but I had forgotten because
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:58.920]   they're gone. All those, they're gone. But yeah, stickers to know how to do it. And then, um, they
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   would move it moving. It's the easiest thing and starting the dryer is super easy. The harder, the
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:11.060]   harder part was folding. Yes. Because some, my daughter used to want to fold, but it would exhaust
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.720]   her. It was so much work for a three-year-old, you know, like I have some adorable pictures of
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.280]   folding her clothes and she's got these beautiful little piles, but she peters out after 30 minutes.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:27.040]   Who wouldn't? Peter out folding clothes for 30 minutes. Um, so then I just started teaching her
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:34.240]   kind of quicker folding methods or just stuffing. Um, and my, it's so funny. My third born is excellent
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:40.380]   at folding clothes, but he just doesn't want to take the time. He's actually like meticulous. If he's
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:46.040]   slow, but he is my shover, man, he barely gets the stuff in the right drawer. I don't care.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.740]   You let him decide what's important to him. If it's important enough to them, they'll figure it out
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:36:01.080]   and they'll spend the time. Otherwise you can't make them care. So just let that go. Yeah.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.000]   That's so good. I love it.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.960]   Were chores part of your homeschool day? Like, is this?
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:12.340]   Um, yes. Everybody had certain things that they had to do every morning. We had a dog. And so
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:18.300]   somebody is always feeding the dog. Somebody is always, um, um, clearing the breakfast dishes and
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.900]   loading the dishwasher. They had, I, we are make your bed every day people. And so they were expected
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:31.480]   to make their bed and the floor has to be, well, the things have to be put away every night. So we
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.140]   all did that. But in the morning, um, don't leave your clothes. Do not leave your clothes. If it took
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.960]   you four tries to find the outfit you wanted, the other three better be put away. Um, and so then they
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.600]   would come down, um, um, and they did their own laundry from about double digits. When they hit
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.520]   double digits, they had to do their own. And it, for me, it was because they started getting picky
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.800]   about, well, I don't want this to be washed with this. And I said, well, then you need to be in charge
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.620]   as I'm out. Cause I'm not, I'm not going to be that picky. I'm going to do mine and daddy's
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:13.040]   and you do yours. Um, and so I, they did have chores that they had to do every day. And we did
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:19.760]   the Saturday chore thing too. So your big chores, the big clean the bathroom, um, vacuum and mop
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.000]   help daddy in the yard. Uh, cause he didn't have a boy. So we all helped with the yard work. Um,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.100]   but I will tell you this. Um,
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:38.020]   when I can remember when my oldest graduated from high school, Lee was doing a podcast and she said,
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.780]   I want you to come on and tell me all the things that you were happy that you did and all the things
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:50.960]   that you regretted. And what I told her then I said, I regret that I did not make a bigger deal
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:59.640]   out of learning how to do some of the big chores. Like, I don't think my oldest really learned how to
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.460]   iron. Now, lots of people now are thinking, Oh yeah, I don't iron. I don't iron. But there's
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.880]   some situations where you need to be able to iron something. So, and, and there were, there were big
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:17.400]   cooking. There are certain, um, big things that she didn't know how to cook. And, and so I look back
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:29.520]   and think, I wish I had spent more intentional time on home maintenance and on big chores. Now I did at
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:39.120]   one point when my younger daughter, um, was about 11, I was traveling some for CC and my husband,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.980]   he loves to eat, but he, he could also take it or leave it. He loves everything that I cook and he's
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:51.700]   always very appreciative. But I mean, his mom was not a big cook. And so he was just like, I mean,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.000]   a sandwich or soup, that's fine. My older daughter would rather do almost anything than eat. It's not
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.260]   that she doesn't like food. It's that she likes a lot of other things more. So when I was gone,
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:09.240]   I would call home and my younger daughter would say, they don't feed me. And I'm like, honey,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:15.320]   I mean, this can't be the truth. And so she would say, I go and say to daddy, what are we having?
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.860]   And he says, I don't know. What do you want? And so I would ask Stephanie, what do you want? And she
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:27.300]   never knows. And so, and so I'm like, okay, so a, I know daddy's not starving you, but I do believe
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.320]   that daddy doesn't care and that sister doesn't care. And so I said, I'm going to teach you. I was
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.640]   never gone from home more than three days in a row. So I taught her to cook three things. And I said,
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:44.360]   look, when you're getting hungry, you go and fix it. And when it's ready, you tell them and they will
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.020]   come. They won't like it. They will. They don't have to fix it. They don't have to decide. They just
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:56.360]   come. And so she, right. And so something good, plenty of it, hot and on time. That's what I used to hear
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:06.640]   lots. Um, and so I did, I did teach my younger daughter to cook earlier. Um, and it was self
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:14.340]   preservation for her. And, and, and so that, that is one of the ways that we did chores. Um, I think
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.380]   chores are important. I think it's important for kids to know that I think it's important for them to
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.180]   know how to take care of themselves, but I also think it's important for them to know that they have a
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:31.940]   responsibility, um, to the family. And that's part of, of loving your family. Well, is serving them by
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.520]   doing something on behalf of the family. Yeah.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:46.420]   Hey, parents, are you interested in your challenge student earning college credit while they are doing
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:54.160]   the work of the classical conversations challenge program? The concurrent enrollment program might
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:01.620]   be just what your family is looking for. You do challenge coursework and earn college credit.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:09.260]   It's a flexible opportunity from an accredited Christian university that honors our homeschool
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:16.640]   families and the program parameters of the challenge guide. Your student can remain in community
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:23.920]   while earning college credit for the work they're already doing, which means community and mentoring
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:31.900]   stay in place while they continue to practice the skills of learning through college. The students
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:39.960]   are assessed by assessors with Rubik's classically minded standards for study and assessment. There's some
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:47.100]   flexibility in number of credits or courses, and there's the potential for earning an associate's degree
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:56.460]   during your students' challenge years. Meet with a dedicated CC plus advisor and personalize this program for your

[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:56.460]   And it's such an integral part of honestly, not to make this sound too dramatic, but just to be honest with you guys, it's such an integral part of what it is like to be human and human in the way that God intended. Like when you go all the way back to Genesis, he gives you dominion over things. That's like the first meeting that he has with them is, hey, I want you to name this stuff. I want you to care for this stuff.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:12.460]   And it's been fascinating with, just for me to watch my son and the way that he responds when he knows how to do something, even if it is, especially actually, especially if it's a very difficult thing that most people would consider a chore.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:32.660]   It gives him this sense of ownership and he's so proud. And the other day I wanted him to clean up his toys and I realized, okay, you really got to frame this well. I mean, sometimes it's just do what I say. But I told him to clean up. And that's one of his choices that he clears the floor because we're not having tripping hazards.
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:49.820]   And I'm pregnant right now. A lot of it is like, hey, remember, we're practicing brothers here. Can't be anything on this floor. And he was just giving me a little bit of resistance over it. And finally, I forgot. I remembered our mantra, which is don't give up.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:56.660]   And so he started saying from the other room, because I got my own chores to do. I started saying, don't give up. I believe in you.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:18.580]   And it flipped a switch in his mind. And suddenly it was this thing to achieve rather than this thing that my mom wants me to do. And he was so proud. But I guess I want to highlight that to say that the mindset behind why we have our children doing things or why we do things is so powerful.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:35.060]   If it's just, oh, we have to X, Y, Z. You're not going to nurture a person within yourself or outside of yourself and your children who really takes that ownership and wants to continue that trait or whatever that thing is on.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:45.340]   But if they have a good reason behind it, even if it is as simple as, hey, I want the satisfaction of a job well done, that is so much more motivating.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:52.600]   And it just spoke volumes to me. I said, okay, I'm going to watch the way I talk. It was so easy. It took no energy for me.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:59.740]   You know, but it got the job done. In five seconds, we were done and we were moving on. And I had been working on that for 10 minutes, you know.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.940]   Wow. Nice.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.580]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.120]   That's really smart.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:12.200]   You learn. You learn to frame things. You learn your children and their mindsets and how to frame things
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.420]   in such a way that you are setting them up for success.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:24.680]   You know, my grandson is three and he actually likes to know a plan.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.760]   Like most little kids melt down at transition.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.820]   So for homeschoolers, it's always the transition times where things go off the rails.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.280]   You know, you're having a great day, but now we need to move from math into reading and things hit the skids.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.480]   And so he, if you say, okay, Gideon, this is the plan.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:50.560]   We are going to play with these blocks and then we're going to have a juice break and then we're going to clean up the blocks.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.300]   And then Lolly's going to read you a story and then you're going to have to go home.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:46:00.140]   Then that gives him all these things and he doesn't whine about it's time to go home.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.220]   I don't want to go home.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.700]   What was the plan?
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.360]   Okay.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.900]   So if you will say, or I want my juice now, but what is the plan?
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.280]   And so he'll go back to that.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.480]   And that's what I was saying earlier about the comfort and having some control.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.200]   Yes.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.900]   Yes.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:26.120]   And when it comes to school time, having like a written visible schedule of some sort or plan or checklist or whatever works for your kid that they can see visually.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.440]   Here's where we are.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.640]   Here's what still needs to happen.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:35.000]   And that's another place to give kids lots of independence and move them towards that.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:43.020]   And also, Delise, what you were talking about was just reminding me of wanting to give our kids every opportunity to learn independence.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.200]   And Lisa, you were talking about wanting them to learn how to cook.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:58.580]   One thing I think that those of us who are really scheduled and regimented have more trouble with is inviting people to see what we're doing so I can show you how.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.340]   Because we're so like, I need to get it done.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.340]   I need to get it done.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.300]   I need to get it done.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.780]   You know, you're going to slow me down.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.900]   So as much as we, you know, and other people have are super great at that.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.560]   My dad is incredible at being like, hey, I'm doing this.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.340]   Come watch.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.220]   Let me show you how I'm doing this.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.400]   He is so amazing at that.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.200]   I love that.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.260]   So we all have different strengths and weaknesses.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:30.460]   But those of us who don't have that as a strength, we need to work harder at slowing down and looking for places where we can invite them in to just see what we're doing.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:38.920]   You know, and how amazing if our kid asks or gives an opening, like your daughter, like, you were like, I need to teach you how to cook three meals.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.840]   And my daughter came to me one day and said, I want to learn how to make cookies by myself.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   And I was like, that sounds fabulous.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.780]   Because then I don't have to do it.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:56.320]   So we worked, I like wrote up a recipe for her that had extra notes in there so that she could follow it verbatim because it was like her first recipe to ever follow.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.700]   And it's fabulous.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.780]   She makes the cookies for the family now.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.420]   It's fantastic.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.200]   That's so awesome.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.760]   I know.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.840]   That's really awesome.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   So just looking for ways where they can be independent, giving them more independence.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.060]   And throwing yourself down and up.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:10.840]   Yes.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.060]   I will say, this is really funny because this is just the stage of life I'm in.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.420]   I just, I'm going to own it.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:26.960]   I was not real good at that as a young mama because what you said, Emily, I'm, I just need to get her done.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.440]   We have like 15 things in a day that probably could really only have handled 12.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.560]   And so I'm just moving and I don't want to step on you.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.220]   Okay.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.020]   As a grandmother.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.940]   So I'm speaking.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.280]   That's exciting.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.820]   I want to speak true.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.120]   I want to speak life to you.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:49:01.500]   As a grandmother, I have not, I know now that probably nine of those 15 things, none of us remember now.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:14.700]   And, and it was the six, it's a couple of those six that if I had slowed down would have made the memory that my children hold on to.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:20.480]   And, and, and with my grandchildren, I'm now slowing down.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.900]   And so I'm like, I was making, the last time they were here, I was making cookies and Gideon said, I want to help.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:32.820]   And I'm like, okay, this is not going to go well because he's going to want to touch all the ingredients and it's going to be everywhere.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.100]   And, but you know what?
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:39.920]   I thought, but then I would get to spend more time with you because you would be standing up on the stool.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:50.400]   And so we talked about what, what's, what's called this, you know, that's a tablespoon, that's a teaspoon, that's a spatula.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:50:11.420]   But I just, I know I'm going to look back one day and I won't care that on, you know, June the 10th, I had a really clean kitchen floor.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:19.840]   But I will remember that when Gideon was three, he helped me make cookies and he was proud.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.640]   So let me just, let me just encourage you, slow down.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.840]   It'll be okay.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:37.860]   And what a great thought as we are wrapping up this show to really bring to the forefront of our minds, because we both want to be people of, of rhythm and structure responsible.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.980]   I think that's really where this is coming from in our hearts.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.960]   We want to be good stewards of our time.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:50.320]   And being a good steward of your time also looks like choosing to slow down.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:50.960]   The better thing.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.900]   Reemptively deciding to have margin in your day.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.140]   Yes.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.440]   You haven't even touched on that yet, but that's an undercurrent in a lot of the things you heard us say.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:06.080]   Just like, don't pack it so tight that if you drop one thing, the whole thing goes kapow.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.100]   You gotta know how to do that.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.740]   And, and, and that is a holy thing.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.920]   That is something that the Lord has modeled for us.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.520]   He always had margin.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:21.280]   Like I love, I just finished reading Mark and I love looking at the way Jesus managed his time.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:27.220]   Cause it's like, he both gets up early, but then he has space to turn around and say, hang on, who touched me?
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.740]   You know, and he's headed somewhere that says he has a plan.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.620]   He has to go here.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.600]   He's got to do that.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.180]   Their structure, the prayer times at the tabernacle, we're at a specific time.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:37.820]   They're on time.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.780]   They're making it, you know?
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.500]   So it's not as though everything's just so loosey goosey.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.220]   However, I know he's the God of the universe.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.720]   We also call ourselves Christians and we're modeling our lives after him.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.720]   And, and I think he can teach us to do that.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.440]   I believe he can teach us to do that.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.740]   So I love that there's room for both a plan and the flexibility.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.580]   Ladies, as we close this conversation down, I have a feeling that there could be a mom listening
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:12.580]   who is feeling very overwhelmed and she knows she's drowning and she knows she needs to, you
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.980]   know, take the whole thing down to the studs and she's hoping to do that, but she doesn't
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.840]   know where to start.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:23.380]   What would you say to a mom who needs just a little pep talk because she's got to do tomorrow
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.380]   and she's going to do tomorrow.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.840]   But what would you say to that mom, Emily?
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.120]   I would tell her that, that it's going to be okay.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.440]   Every season is different.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:38.160]   And some seasons feel really crazy, even to those of us who appear to be scheduled and
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.800]   regimented.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.980]   And I think I just, I like to encourage people who say that maybe being scheduled or routine
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.540]   oriented is not natural for them.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:52.120]   I encourage them to kind of look, look at their days and see, figure out what, what are
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:57.320]   your priorities and how do you need to adjust things to make sure that those things happen?
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.500]   And then you can let the other things kind of fill in the spaces.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.660]   So that being a starting point, and you're not, you're not going to go from feeling like
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:12.940]   a hot mess to super routine, you know, there's got to be some slow baby steps.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:19.480]   So maybe it's even getting yourself out of bed first before the kids wake up.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.940]   I don't know how many moms I've heard say, I hate it when the kids wake me up because then
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.700]   I already feel 10 steps behind.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.500]   Right.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.900]   So, you know, it may be as small as getting up 30 minutes before your kids get up so that
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.680]   you feel like you have a head start on the day.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:42.060]   So doing one little step at a time, I think, to move towards some sort of routine for your
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.280]   normal days.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.100]   We all have weird days, but for your normal days.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.380]   That's great.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.080]   What would you add to that, Lisa?
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:54:02.980]   I would just remind all of us that we actually do have time in every day to do everything
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.800]   that the Lord calls us to do.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:13.420]   So on the days when I am just foaming at the mouth because I don't have time to do all of
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:19.640]   these things, I frequently have to remind myself, so what is it that I'm doing that was not the
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.040]   Lord's plan for me?
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:28.480]   Because if 10 things are too many, he must not have wanted me to do all 10 of those things.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:39.700]   And I would also remind young mamas, be gentle with yourselves and realize the same thing is
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.720]   true for you that you preach is true for your children.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:50.300]   Anything that's worth doing well, you're going to do badly first.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:57.880]   You're not going to be great at managing the rhythm every day right out of the gate.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:06.300]   Like Emily was saying, give yourself time and permission to grow into that and to let your
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:14.220]   children grow into that and to realize that the most important thing that they want is your
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.320]   time and your attention.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:23.120]   It's not a perfect house or a perfect schedule or every checkbox filled in.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.660]   They want to be with you.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.460]   And why did you begin to homeschool anyway?
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.560]   It was to be with your children.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.520]   That's so good.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.520]   Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.580]   I can't even tell you how many times I heard my mother say that.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.860]   And it's so true.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:44.000]   And a world full of, quote, experts.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.060]   We need to be reminded of that.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:54.860]   Well, you guys, I hope that you enjoyed just listening to us chat about the reality of trying
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:01.100]   to frame our lives and that it encouraged you that you got some wind in your sails this
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:01.360]   week.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:07.600]   If this show did encourage you, we would love for you to give us a review wherever you listen
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:11.460]   to your podcast and also to share the show with a friend.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:17.040]   Everyone is navigating this conversation of scheduling and rhythms.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.140]   And so send this to a couple of mamas who you know could use a little pep talk.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.260]   And make sure to go and find us over on YouTube.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.800]   We do videos now.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.460]   And we are on the Classical Conversations YouTube channel.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:34.420]   So we would love to hear from you over there, connect with you, hear your thoughts.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:39.220]   Let us know in the comments something that you do schedule-wise that has really changed the
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.100]   game for your family.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.740]   We'd love to encourage one another and keep spurring each other on.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.760]   And we will see you again back on the show next week.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.620]   Thanks for listening.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:54.440]   I'll see you again back on the show next week.
