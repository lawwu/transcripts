[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What are some of the signs of a high conflict personality?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.740]   Because in an ideal world, we avoid these people.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740]   And again, we're not trying to say that they're bad people.
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.860]   Some of them are bad people, some of them aren't.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.180]   But since I'm not a clinical psychologist, you are,
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.500]   you can make the assessment certainly better than I can.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.280]   What are some of the ways to avoid these circumstances
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.060]   besides the first year rule?
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820]   And then let's talk about some ways to disentangle
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.420]   from these people based on their unique phenotypes.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.140]   So is there a question or set of questions
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.700]   one should ask themselves when they are potentially
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.380]   dating someone, potentially becoming friends with somebody,
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.860]   potentially becoming coworkers with somebody, and so on?
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.820]   - Yeah, so what's interesting is often your gut feeling
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.620]   tells you something's up here.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.360]   Like the person suddenly has a shocking opinion
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.260]   of somebody else, and they say, you know,
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.060]   that person's a total jerk, and yet you know that person,
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.300]   and they're not a total jerk.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.220]   They suddenly, something's disproportionate.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.220]   I think disproportionate emotions is often a trigger.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.160]   I put in a lot of my books now what I call the web method,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.220]   is pay attention to their words, your emotions,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.060]   and their behavior.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.320]   So starting with words, do they use a lot of blaming words?
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740]   You know, it's all that person's fault.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.720]   Do they use all or nothing words?
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.420]   They seem to see things through a narrow lens,
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.140]   that you know, there's all good, there's all bad.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.360]   Unmanaged emotions, which they may or may not show,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.500]   like I explained.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   Some people are good at hiding all that,
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.120]   even though it drives them inside.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.540]   And the extreme behaviors, do they do things
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.860]   90% of people would never do?
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.420]   And I'll give an example here.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280]   And this is, I won't say the city,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.980]   but there was a mayor, there was someone who worked,
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.860]   who was a congressperson, and they decided to run for mayor
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.900]   in their city, instead of flying to go to Congress.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.940]   But when they were flying to go to Congress back and forth,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.260]   this is in California, I'll say that much.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.900]   People can easily research this.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.860]   So this person, flying back and forth,
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.700]   one day, one night, standing, you know,
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.300]   there was a line to get your bags at the airport
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.600]   after you got off the plane.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.700]   And he was told to wait in line to get his bags.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.780]   And he said, "Don't you know who I am?"
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.340]   And he pushed his way to the front of the line,
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.460]   and had an argument with the person behind the counter,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.420]   said, "Don't you know who I am?
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.780]   "I want my bag right now."
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.340]   And she said, "You don't have it now,
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.020]   "you can't have it right now."
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.780]   And he pushed her and knocked her over.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.940]   He shoved this airline worker behind the counter
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.140]   and knocked her over.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.540]   - This was a mayor of a major--
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.220]   - Not yet, he wasn't mayor yet.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.920]   He was a congressperson.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.300]   Anyway, so that means he's--
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.740]   - Sorry, no knocking.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.200]   I know some very decent congresspeople, but like, okay.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.100]   Whoa in any case, right?
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.140]   This person could be any number of different professions.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.980]   - Yes.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.100]   - Yeah, this is antisocial behavior.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.660]   - But this is a high profile person.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.020]   So this is all over the news the next day.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.780]   This is 20 years ago, maybe, 15 years ago,
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.060]   something like that.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.000]   - Goodness.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.220]   - Anyway, so it's in the newspaper the next day.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.860]   And newspaper says, "Congressman so-and-so
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.700]   "gets into physical altercation with airline worker."
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.700]   Knocks her over.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.620]   Half the people said, "That's terrible."
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.040]   And the other half the people said, "Wait, wait.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   "He was sleep deprived.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.180]   "He was flying across country.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.460]   "You have to understand that he was stressed."
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.660]   And here's where my web method comes in.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.220]   90% of people would not have done that
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.380]   even if they were sleep deprived.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.660]   And I fly back and forth a lot.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.380]   And I'm not, I don't do that.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.940]   - I would like to think 99% of people wouldn't do that.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.580]   - I think you're right, 99%.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.700]   - To get physical with an airline person over a bag.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.420]   The cutting to the front of the line is egregious.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.300]   The shoving the airline person is like beyond the pale.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.300]   So this is, so anyway, so he's running for mayor
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.380]   and I'm going, "This guy's a high conflict person.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.500]   "If he gets elected, he's not gonna be a very good mayor.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.020]   "He's gonna have a lot of trouble
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.860]   "with the people close to him."
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.740]   And so guess what happened?
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.020]   He gets elected.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.660]   Within, I think it's eight months, he is,
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.900]   and this is before the Me Too movement got started,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.780]   but people are reporting he's harassing women,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.240]   sexually harassing women.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.500]   Women come into his office to meet with him,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.180]   professional, experienced, important,
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.340]   and he's like wanting to touch them a lot.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.060]   Inappropriately, they don't wanna be touched.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.760]   Anyway, so women start complaining about him.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.700]   Word kinda gets out, yeah, this happened
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.080]   with a lot of different people,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.260]   that he's not sexually assaulting them,
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.900]   but he's treating them badly.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.900]   - So it cuts across domains.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.220]   It's like in-- - Yes.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.900]   - So it's not just in the office, it's there,
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.020]   but it's also at the airport.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.860]   It's basically any time he's not getting what he wants,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.340]   he throws a tantrum.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.060]   - And that's the thing with personality disorders,
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.700]   is a narrower range of behavior
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.220]   that's repeated in a variety of settings.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.960]   So he's fitting all of that.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.800]   So which personality disorder, I'm not gonna diagnose him,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.620]   but it narrows down to one or two.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.740]   - So it's not context-dependent, it is--
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.700]   - Right.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.180]   - It's pervasive.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.300]   - Pervasive, and that word is in the diagnostic manual,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.060]   that it's pervasive across, I think, several settings.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.500]   I think that's the words, but let me just finish.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.340]   - Yeah, please, please.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.820]   - 'Cause the end of the story, (laughs)
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.820]   the end of the story is, he's also got committees
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.100]   and people that are supposed to accomplish things.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.540]   He doesn't want them to think, he wants them to,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.980]   he wants to do the thinking and tell them what to do.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.540]   So he goes around alienating a lot of people.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.540]   Within eight months, he's out of office,
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.500]   because enough people were upset.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.860]   And the way he got out of office is,
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.460]   some of the heads of government told him,
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.900]   I think it was the city attorney or something,
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.820]   "If you quit now, we'll help you with your legal expenses,"
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.580]   'cause he's starting to get sued for some of this stuff,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.520]   suing the city, suing him,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   "We'll help you with your legal expenses if you quit now."
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.280]   And there was starting to be a petition movement for some,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   I don't know, the mechanics, like a special election
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   or something to get rid of him.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.400]   Anyway, within eight months, he was out of the office.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.760]   And now you don't hear about him in that city.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.600]   - It's a very interesting, literally high-profile,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.840]   although still anonymous, based on this conversation, case.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   I wonder if on a more subtle or typical level,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.680]   the following is informative or not.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.160]   I'm not looking for a validation of the example
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   I'm about to give, but I've been very surprised at times
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.360]   how a person who I'm with for the first time out on a meal
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.920]   will behave towards the wait staff.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   - Yes.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.800]   - Not explicitly disparaging of them,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.280]   but sometimes mildly disparaging of them.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.160]   Or feeling as if the amount of liquid
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.500]   poured into their glass was somehow an indication
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.720]   of how the waiter felt about them or didn't feel about them.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.200]   Like reading into these things
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.300]   where you're just thinking to yourself like,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.640]   "Whoa, life must be really tough for you.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.800]   Like who's paying attention to this stuff?"
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.140]   And so that's one that I've noticed in people.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.440]   And it's proved informative.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.320]   - It's really a useful thing to see.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.360]   That's part of what you see, their behavior,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.520]   and their behavior towards other people.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.160]   This was a brilliant thing.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.440]   I don't remember the name of the program,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.940]   but there was a guy who was head of a company,
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.960]   and he used to, when he was interviewing people
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.920]   for high-level jobs, he pretended he was a taxi driver
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.760]   or something, would pick them up at the airport
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.680]   as the taxi driver and see how they treated him
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.960]   as the taxi driver.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.620]   And then he gets in the interview room,
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.820]   and he's the guy interviewing them.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.860]   And in some cases, people treated him really disrespectfully.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.080]   And it's like, now I know this is not someone I want.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   - Clever.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.800]   I made the decision to not work for somebody years ago
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.480]   when I was on a very different stage in my career
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   based on how that person treated a janitor.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.880]   And it was amazing because it was one
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.920]   very brief interaction.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.980]   And it wasn't like this person yelled at the janitor.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.840]   It was the dismissiveness.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.720]   - Yeah.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.840]   - And I remember it was this, your web approach.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.760]   It was his, I guess I just revealed,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.980]   it was his words towards the janitor.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.760]   It was my emotional response was sort of like,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.800]   I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.000]   I was like, hey, that was...
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.960]   It just felt like a very,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.280]   what I would call like the football play,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.660]   unnecessary roughness.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.500]   - Yes.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.920]   - It was mild from the perspective of like,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.120]   no one got physical or called anyone names,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.240]   but I remember thinking like, oh, like that sucked.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.080]   - Right.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.460]   - And then their behavior was just to just go right back
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.200]   to what they were talking about.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.360]   And I knew in that moment, I was really crestfallen
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.900]   because in that moment I knew, oh my goodness,
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.760]   I can't work for this person.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.600]   - Yeah.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.420]   - Like I just can't.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.320]   And I made the decision not to.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.420]   And actually their response to my deciding not to
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.320]   for a variety of other reasons too,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   confirmed everything that I suspected
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.240]   in that one little interaction.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080]   - Yes.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.460]   - But it's interesting because we're trained
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.460]   to collect data rather carefully.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.040]   You know, and we don't wanna make snap judgment.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.880]   Somebody could truly be having a bad day,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.080]   but in this case it was the right decision
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.920]   to not work for them.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.740]   Thank goodness.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.840]   I thank my lucky stars.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.060]   Made some really bad decisions about people in my life.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.540]   That was a really good decision.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.300]   I never spent a day regretting it.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   And I went to work for someone else
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.640]   who was terrific instead.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.480]   - Right.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.080]   - So, but as you said, these things sometimes hit
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.980]   at a somatic level, as opposed to some sort of,
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.380]   wait, did, you know, some like very cerebral analytic thing.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.060]   It kind of hits at a, what must be a very primitive circuit.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.820]   I can't help the neuroscientist in me wants to say,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.020]   like, it's gotta be something at the level of the body
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.520]   where we go, wait, that was messed up.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.460]   - And you can't really point to a specific word.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.980]   And then you start to question yourself.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.820]   That's the problem.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.060]   You wonder was, well, maybe their tone wasn't,
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.780]   maybe it's my own perception, but I don't know.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.960]   Maybe the body doesn't lie.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.340]   Maybe it knows.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.460]   - I think the body is like a first responder
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.820]   and that we should pay attention to that.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.220]   And especially with high conflict personalities,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.300]   especially the con artists,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.220]   which is part of antisocial personality,
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.480]   and the ones I've dealt with are very good at this,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.060]   is their words are just right.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.740]   And your brain is like soothed by them.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.180]   You go, this person gets it and I'm totally comfortable.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.060]   They're charming, all of that.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.900]   And your gut goes, wait, they're out of sync.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.300]   I have this cold feeling.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.740]   Why do I have this cold feeling?
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.740]   And I think that they're aimed at your cerebral thinking
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.300]   and that your guts kind of gets it
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.420]   because they're in a way predatory,
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.020]   like antisocial tend to be predatory.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.560]   - Those people have dead eyes.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.860]   I've known a few.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.420]   I've known a few men and women and their eyes are,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.800]   I can only describe, and I'm a vision neuroscientist.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.060]   That's like what my career has been.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.780]   And those are two little pieces of brain right there.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.180]   And there's something about the deadness.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.060]   And I don't have a science to support what I'm about to say.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.180]   There's something about the deadness in their eyes.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.220]   Maybe their pupils don't change shape
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.460]   with levels of arousal the same way other people's do,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.900]   'cause we know that happens in healthy,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   people with an unhealthy autonomic nervous system,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   but there's something lacking.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.740]   - Yeah.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.660]   - And people make up all sorts of theories online.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.580]   Like I'm not a big blinker.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.420]   I don't blink.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.840]   When I'm concentrating, blinks break up my flow.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.340]   And this is actually a way I can remember things.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.340]   People have these theories about blinking, non-blink.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.220]   The research doesn't support any relationship
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.380]   between blink frequency and personality.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.020]   They had this whole theory about Zuck too.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.320]   Like he doesn't blink, therefore he's whatever, he's a robot.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.700]   None of that holds up.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.400]   What does hold up, however, is this mismatch between words
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.220]   and the affect that it creates in us.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.060]   - Yeah.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.140]   - It's sort of like it sounds right,
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.500]   but it doesn't feel right.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.020]   I wish we understood more about this at the level of science.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.640]   There are a lot of theories, not a lot of tools.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.300]   - Someday, I think, yeah.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.380]   - Yeah, the tools for measuring this stuff
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.420]   are getting better.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.340]   I wanted to ask you about other ways of just knowing
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.180]   if you're interacting with a high conflict person
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.580]   when the cues are more subtle.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.020]   Are there other things or examples of the web method
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.760]   that come to mind?
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.940]   - Well, for me, of course, dealing with court especially,
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.140]   there's a lot of stuff in writing.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.260]   And so being able to look at what's written
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.580]   and a lot of blame words, the all or nothing words.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.900]   She did this and she did that.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.120]   And disparaging words, she's stupid or whatever.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.420]   Or he's a bully, he's this and that.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.100]   Which triggers for me, maybe he is,
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.140]   or maybe the person saying it is,
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.880]   but it heightens my attention.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.460]   - Yeah, how do you disambiguate between projection
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.300]   and a real thing?
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.780]   Like online now?
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.120]   - I mean, one of the fastest ways
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.140]   to get a popular social media account
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   is for somebody to give advice
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.740]   about how to avoid bad people.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.460]   You know, name calling, gaslighting, narcissist,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.340]   sociopath, psychopath, history on it.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.020]   Like these are clinical terms
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.340]   that now the general public can leverages
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.940]   to like, you know, sort of amplify community.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.820]   And then in part, I understand
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.060]   from talking to people on the tech side
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.500]   is that social media is social.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.340]   - Right.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.160]   - The accounts that grow fastest
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.020]   are the ones where you don't need much language
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.700]   to convey what you're trying to convey,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.300]   like a sport or dance or an animal.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.340]   And among the others that grow very quickly
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.020]   and therefore rewarding to people
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.020]   are ones where you're recruiting these negative advocates.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.340]   - First of all, I wanna make sure
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.740]   that I get this point across.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.780]   And that is, there's a lot of temptation
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.340]   to label people with like the mental disorders,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.460]   the personality disorders.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.060]   And it's absolutely essential that people don't do that.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.180]   If you think somebody might be a narcissist
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.260]   or might have borderline personality or be antisocial,
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.500]   keep that to yourself and adapt how you work with them
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.900]   to be more effective or be more cautious, whatever.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.020]   But the worst thing I think is people say,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.900]   oh, and everyone agrees that person's a narcissist.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.500]   So we kind of gang up on that person.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.540]   That's not helpful.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.660]   The goal is not rejecting people.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.340]   The goal is adapting what you do
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.580]   to either manage the relationship,
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.440]   decide, okay, that's not someone I'm gonna get close to,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.380]   but I can still work with them
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.020]   or have them as neighbors or whatever.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.540]   So I wanna emphasize that 'cause I think you're right.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.820]   There's a lot of that today.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.860]   And people come to me with that concern.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.520]   They say, Bill, you teach about personality disorders.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.580]   Yeah, so people understand patterns of behavior
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.940]   and how to adapt your own behavior.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.020]   I'm not teaching people to label other people.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.760]   So that's real important.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.500]   - Yeah, people go to school for many years
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   and do 3,000 plus clinical hours
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.340]   to learn how to do that, to do that properly.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.740]   It's like saying, it's like diagnosing anything, right?
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.700]   I mean, a dermatologist might be able to help diagnose
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.580]   a skin patch for potential cancer,
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.740]   but we're taught that we're not supposed
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.580]   to do that ourselves.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.420]   - So we have to be cautious.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.500]   But on the other hand, aware.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.300]   And the more you're aware of patterns,
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.040]   like being aware of someone with an alcohol abuse issue
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.240]   is to go, okay, I'm not gonna be serving him alcohol
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.060]   with dinner, he's a great person,
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.720]   but I'm just gonna leave that out of the evening meal.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.860]   Adapt to what we do rather than judging them.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.220]   And I don't see people with personality disorders
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.780]   as lesser beings.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   I see them as having a different set of behaviors
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.980]   that they acquired pretty much in childhood.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.260]   So I don't hold it against them.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.060]   I may dislike their patterns of behavior,
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.300]   but I really don't hate people like that.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.780]   I've been a therapist with clients like that.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.340]   So I think our awareness needs to be there
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.240]   so we adapt how we work with people.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   But I think the gut feeling is so important.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   And as a therapist, I was trained,
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.760]   pay attention to your gut 'cause that's gonna help you
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.860]   with your clients.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.040]   And that's why the web method.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.600]   Their words, their behavior,
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.520]   but how I feel often gives me tips.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
