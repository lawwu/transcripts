[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Okay, let's talk clothing and gear. It would be hard for me not to start with Viore gear.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.160]   Right now I'm wearing three pieces of it and that was not intentional. It just happens to be what I
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.480]   wear all the time. I've got a pair of Sunday Performance joggers. I've got a Strato Tech T
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   and a Ponto Performance half zip hoodie. Love all these products. I was actually at a conference
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.920]   recently and a couple people ended up touching my shoulder, my arm or something and they were like,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.960]   "Wow, this is so soft. What is it?" I was like, "Oh, it's Viore." I felt like I was a walking
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   billboard for this company and I don't even get all of my Viore clothes for free. I actually pay
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.520]   for them. I just love them that much. Amy is as big of a fan as I am. So many great products,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.440]   leggings, sports bras, shirts, jackets, everything.
