[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.400]   And before we look at today's question,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   just a note of update, Pastor John speaks Wednesday night
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900]   at the Pipeline Conference,
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.160]   which is a gathering of pastors in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.200]   He'll be speaking on the topic of ministry succession.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.320]   And I look forward to hearing that message.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.280]   Please keep him in your prayers
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.700]   as he finishes up his message prep today
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.640]   and travels out to Tennessee.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.280]   And now onto today's question.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.120]   As you know, Pastor John,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.880]   new listeners are coming to our podcast every day.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.700]   And many of them don't know what lies behind your answers
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.560]   to the questions that people are sending in to us.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   And for example, your view on God is important.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.920]   It's foundational, Jesus Christ, the Bible,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   the human condition, the future,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.960]   all of those things are really foundational.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.400]   And so we thought maybe it'd be helpful now
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.440]   and then to include a podcast,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.260]   not addressing a question per se,
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.880]   but talking about a foundational reality,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.120]   part of the deepest convictions
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.440]   that shape the way you think
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920]   and approach all the many questions about life
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.480]   that our listeners send in.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.160]   So Pastor John, you've said many times before
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.880]   that you believe in the absolute sovereignty of God,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.120]   that he finally and decisively controls all things,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.700]   from the farthest galaxy to the smallest subatomic particle,
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.300]   including all the actions of human beings.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.080]   I think what our listeners would like to hear from you
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.520]   is not only why you believe that,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.400]   but mainly how does this truth make a difference
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.920]   in our daily lives?
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280]   - Well, that's right.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.520]   That is precisely one of the foundational,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.960]   pervasively influential convictions
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.560]   that I have behind everything I do and think.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.080]   And let me give just one passage of scripture as to why,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   and then four really practical ways
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.920]   that this makes a difference in our lives.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.080]   I just spoke recently to the new students
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.800]   at Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.460]   and I shared with them what difference it would make
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.820]   in their lives as students this year,
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.240]   as they pursue rigorous studies, if they believe this.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.000]   So this is fresh on my front burner.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So the text that gives a glimpse into why I believe this
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.400]   is the book of James 4, verses 13 to 17,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.520]   where James says, "Come now you who say,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.620]   "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.580]   "and spend a year there and trade, make a profit.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.460]   "Yet you do not know about tomorrow, what it will bring.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.860]   "What is your life?
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.080]   "You are a mist that appears for a little time
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.380]   "and then vanishes.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.340]   "Instead, you ought to say,
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.340]   "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.620]   "as it is you boast in your arrogance."
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.820]   So there it is.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.780]   You ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live."
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.920]   So I conclude from that, if the Lord doesn't will, we die.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.540]   If he does will, we live.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.700]   The Lord is absolutely in control of everything
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.220]   that determines our life and our death.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.140]   We don't live a second longer than he wills.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.860]   We don't die a second sooner than he wills.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860]   And I believe this brings amazing stability and strength
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.300]   and courage and boldness and risk-taking
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.940]   into the Christian life,
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.180]   if we believe that God is good and sovereign.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.180]   And then he says, "Not just we will live,
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.340]   "but rather we will do this or that."
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.480]   That's James' way of saying everything.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.300]   And he's referring to practical things like,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.660]   "Tomorrow we will go into such and such a town
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.780]   "and spend a year there and make a profit."
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.540]   Then he says, "No, no, you should say,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   "If the Lord wills, we will do this or that,"
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.220]   which I conclude means we won't do this
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.500]   if it's not the will of the Lord.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.460]   And we won't do that, or we will do that,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.460]   if it is the will of the Lord.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.340]   So there's a text, that's especially verse 15
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.120]   of James chapter four, which I think tells us
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.100]   to practically believe and govern our lives
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.860]   by the conviction that God is completely sovereign
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.180]   over all the details of life and death
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.420]   and whether we do this or that.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.040]   Now, does that make a practical difference in our lives?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.720]   It is so amazingly practical.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.320]   Let me give you four glimpses of why this undergirds
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.080]   everything I say on "Ask Pastor John."
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.740]   Number one, well, let me just list them off for you.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.740]   It has to do with gospel joy and sacrificial love
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.260]   and fearless witness and confident planning.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.840]   Those are my four practical glimpses
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.020]   into how this is so personally relevant to our lives.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.580]   So let me just take them one at a time
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.740]   and give one text and a brief word.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.500]   So gospel joy, every day John Piper needs the gospel.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.420]   That is, I need fresh assurances that my sins are forgiven,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.520]   that God is for me and not against me,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020]   that I'm not destined for wrath, but everlasting joy.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.020]   I need the gospel preached to me with assurance every day.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.620]   I need confidence that when Jesus died on the cross
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.180]   under Pontius Pilate, this was not a fluke of history.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.140]   This was not random.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.140]   This was God's sovereign plan to save John Piper.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.260]   So here's the text that connects the sovereignty of God
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.900]   down to the details of sinners' doings and the gospel.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.100]   Acts 4:27, "Truly in this city,
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.860]   there were gathered together against your holy servant,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.100]   Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod, Pontius Pilate,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.580]   the Gentiles, the peoples of Israel,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.540]   to do whatever your hand and your plan
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.700]   had predestined to take place."
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.300]   Amazing.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.440]   Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentile soldiers,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.700]   the crowds crying, "Crucify him, crucify him,"
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.820]   all of them doing what God had predestined to take place.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.540]   Or to paraphrase, using the words of James,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540]   "Since the Lord willed, they lived and did this or that."
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.180]   Jesus' death, down to the details of the fulfillment
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.980]   of prophecy, like the throwing of dice
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.060]   for the choosing of his clothing,
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.140]   was under God's sovereign control.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.900]   It was not a random event, which gives to me
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.900]   the strong assurance God was totally in charge
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.180]   saving John Piper's soul.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.380]   I need the gospel, and I think that text says,
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.620]   "No sovereignty, no gospel."
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.680]   Here's number two.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.620]   I am called upon, as a Christian now, to love people,
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.860]   to love even my enemies, to do good all the time
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.500]   to those who don't do good to me,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.580]   to make sacrifices to my life and inconvenience myself
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.660]   and not be a selfish person.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.660]   Where in the world do you get the resources in your soul
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.700]   to do good to others when they're not doing good to you?
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   In fact, when it may cost you tremendously
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.340]   to suffer in order to do good for other people.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.140]   The New Testament is filled with summons to live that way,
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.120]   and here's 1 Peter.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   This is Peter's argument or counsel or wisdom
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.320]   for how we are going to be able to do good
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.480]   when we are suffering, and his answer is,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   we must remember God's detailed sovereignty
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.960]   over suffering as we do good.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.800]   Listen to these two verses.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.360]   1 Peter 4, 19, "Let those who suffer," here it is,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   "according to God's will," suffer according to God's will,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.080]   "and trust their souls to a faithful creator
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.520]   "while doing good."
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.560]   Here's 1 Peter 3, 17, "It is better to suffer
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   "for doing good, if that should be God's will,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.120]   "than for doing evil."
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.320]   In other words, suffering is going to come,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.000]   especially to those who are committed to doing good,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.100]   especially doing good to those who don't do good to them.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.640]   But Peter says, take heart, God is sovereign
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.260]   over your suffering.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.920]   No suffering befalls you apart from the will of God.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   He's your father, 1 Peter 1, 17, and your maker,
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.680]   1 Peter 4, 19.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.960]   He's faithful, and trust your soul to him,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.060]   and get on with the tough, hard business of doing good,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.520]   even to those who don't do good to you.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.460]   That's number two.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.900]   No sacrificial love without sovereignty,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.420]   as the Bible sees it.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:34.340]   Number three, sovereignty, the sovereignty of God
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.500]   over my fearless witness.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.220]   I'm called upon to bear witness to Jesus,
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.860]   no matter what the fearful circumstance is.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.860]   How can I overcome fear and be a faithful witness?
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.680]   And here's Jesus' answer in Matthew 10, 28 to 31.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.920]   Watch how sovereignty figures in.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.640]   Do not be afraid of those who kill the body,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.800]   but cannot kill the soul.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.280]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.920]   And not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.960]   apart from your father.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.860]   Fear not.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   Therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.220]   The absolute sovereignty of God
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.220]   over which bird falls dead to the forest floor
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.820]   is the foundation of my fearlessness in my witness.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.780]   And I am precious to him,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.660]   more precious than all those birds
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.660]   whose lives are in God's detailed sovereign control.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.060]   How much more then is God watching over me
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.320]   in all my witness to take care of me
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.760]   and only let me fall dead to the forest floor
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   precisely when it is best for me
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.320]   to fall dead to the forest floor.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.600]   And finally, number four,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.340]   the sovereignty of God and confident planning.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.620]   Planning.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.960]   Not much happens of any use in this world without planning,
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.500]   and yet a lot of people think
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.800]   that planning might be pointless
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.200]   if God's will is always holding sway.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.680]   That's not true.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.000]   When you make a plan,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.040]   which would you rather say?
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.280]   Something like this,
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.820]   if I'm lucky, I'll live and do this or that.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.140]   Or by chance, I may live or do this or that.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.620]   Or as fate may have it, I'll live or do this or that.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.700]   Or would you rather say,
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.700]   if the Lord wills, I will live and do this or that.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.860]   Luck, chance, fate, they're nothing.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.340]   They're just words describing emptiness.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.780]   But when you make a plan that says,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.060]   I plan to do this, not that,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.820]   if the Lord wills, you are building your life
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.460]   on an unshakable foundation, the sovereign will of God.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.180]   The wise man in the Old Testament says,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.440]   the heart of man plans his way,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   but the Lord establishes his steps, Proverbs 16, 9,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.540]   or Proverbs 19, 21.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.340]   Many are the plans of the mind of a man,
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.780]   but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.280]   So it's right to plan.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.620]   We don't accomplish things without a plan.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.340]   So if you rest in the wise, good sovereignty of God
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.180]   in all your plans, you will be a confident,
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.180]   peaceful person because you'll know
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.080]   that whatever details of your plan don't happen,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.060]   God's will always happens.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.260]   And that's part of your plan.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.220]   And that's the most important part,
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.860]   and therefore you can rest in sweet peace.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.880]   So there it is, Tony.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.020]   Joyful, gospel dependence every day.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.900]   Sacrificial love every day.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.760]   Fearless witness every day.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.980]   Confident planning every day.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.980]   Those are daily, practical realities
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.660]   every Christian lives with and needs help with.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.060]   And those texts that we just looked at,
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.860]   all of them point to the absolute,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.260]   detailed sovereignty of God,
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.340]   that he's in full control so that we can say,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.060]   if the Lord wills, I will live and do this or that.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.540]   That conviction informs everything I say
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.460]   and everything I do on this podcast.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.020]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.640]   And may those four realities become four priorities
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.240]   in each of our lives,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.700]   and all with a sturdy foundation under it
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.700]   of God's sovereignty.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.680]   This has huge ramifications for the Christian life.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.060]   Pastor John, thank you for taking us
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.860]   into this one foundation.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.520]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.660]   part of your day and commute.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.460]   And three times a week we publish,
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.420]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.480]   and search our past episodes in our archive.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.180]   Even reach us by email with a question of your own,
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.740]   especially if you have a question about the very foundations
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.420]   of what we do on this podcast.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.900]   We'd love to hear that.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.260]   Do all of that through our online home
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.500]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.780]   Well, is racism the product of nature or nurture?
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.380]   Are we born racists?
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.700]   Or is prejudice something that we learn?
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.060]   This is a question that came up recently
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.100]   based on something President Obama shared on social media
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.660]   in the wake of Charlottesville this summer.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.160]   And it will be our focus when we return on Friday.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.660]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:16.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
