[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   and uh but hopefully at the end i'll relieve that stress a little bit with some ideas and solutions
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.120]   for you so i need everybody to just think for a second reflect on the past 45 days and think about
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200]   all the possible things that have gone on in our industry and all the product launches
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.240]   let me highlight just a few for you but none of that matters none of it matters unless you
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   answer this question what do i build and why will it win your competitive advantage will come from
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.760]   what is uniquely yours these three things your data your functionality and your understanding of
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.000]   unmet customer needs not the ai itself so to recap to win an ai besides being stressed out right is to
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.280]   answer what are your unmet customer problems that's always been a part of product right the second is
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.360]   what ai capabilities can solve those problems in novel ways what proprietary data can power those solutions
