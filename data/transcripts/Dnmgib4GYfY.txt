[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Are rich Christians commanded to downgrade their living standards?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.240]   It's a question from Kevin, a listener to the podcast in South Dakota.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.800]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast and for your ministry, and thank you for preaching
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   against the prosperity gospel and for your personal model of contentment and generosity.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.480]   All of this is prophetically needed in our age.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.960]   But I also have a remaining question on wealth, specifically about 1 Timothy 6, verses 17
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   and 19.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   I am a middle class American, not fabulously wealthy according to the cultural standards
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.600]   of my day, but in the global perspective and historically, I am wealthy.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.560]   Whenever I hear you teach on Paul's text, I hear you imply that the Christian wealthy
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.800]   are called to intentionally downgrade their lifestyles.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.880]   They should live in smaller homes than they could manageably afford and enjoy the simpler
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   pleasures of life.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.280]   There's a wonderful warning here about trusting in wealth that we should all be aware of.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.640]   However, Paul does not seem to say in this text that the wealthy should downgrade their
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.560]   personal lifestyles.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.960]   I read Paul and presume that a wealthy Christian today could live in an 8,000 square foot,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.280]   2 million dollar mansion, drive a new BMW, and still also have their hope set on God,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.280]   the giver of all these gifts, as they magnify Christ in their honest business dealings.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.640]   But in that situation of abundance, Paul would tell them, don't be proud, die to self-sufficiency,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.160]   enjoy it all as a gift, and never set your hope on riches.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.320]   Instead, be rich in good works and be generous and ready to share.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.400]   Verse 18.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.000]   I can see him discouraging the rich from seeking greater wealth accumulation or barn building,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.640]   as Jesus called it.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.960]   But Paul also does not seem to be too concerned with calling the wealthy to purposefully downgrade
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.920]   their own living conditions either.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840]   Am I missing something here?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.760]   Well, let's start by saying something controversial.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:08.440]   Not only does Paul not seem too concerned with calling the wealthy to purposefully downgrade
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.000]   their own living conditions, neither does he seem too concerned with calling slave owners
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480]   to account for holding slaves.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   Yeah, that's controversial.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.240]   So there you go.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.920]   Now that ought to get everybody feeling defensive.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.080]   No, I'm not equating wealth holding with slave holding.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.360]   The point of that comparison is this.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.680]   If Paul chose to explode slave holding, not with direct indictment, but with theological
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   dynamite like 1 Corinthians 7.23, "You were bought with a price.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.280]   Do not become slaves of men," could it be that he might take the same theological explosive
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.600]   approach to weaning people away from luxury?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.280]   Now, before I illustrate what I mean by that, let me clarify something that I'm very aware
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   of.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.440]   I am aware that any warnings or admonitions that I might give to someone who lives a life
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:29.640]   10 times more lavish than my own, someone could give to me, whose life is one-tenth
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.440]   as lavish as my own.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   And I am aware, as an American, that this latter group globally who live lives that
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   are less than one-tenth as lavish as mine are 99% of the world.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.840]   Now here's the implication of that awareness.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:03.040]   Whether I am a first-class hypocrite, which is possible, or I am a culturally conditioned
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   voice trying to let the Word of God call Western affluence to account, including my own, in
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:23.200]   the light of Scripture, without specifying precisely what degree of affluence is destructive
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.920]   to spiritual life and witness.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.360]   So then, how does the New Testament address the issue of luxury and opulence and lavishness
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   and riches?
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.800]   Kevin, of course, is right that Paul does not speak to the wealthy in his churches with
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   condemnation or to the slaveholder either, by the way, with condemnation.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.880]   The text, Kevin, first, who is this, "As for the rich in this present age, charge them
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.320]   not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertainty of riches, but on God, who
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.640]   richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.120]   up treasure for themselves as good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.200]   of that which is truly life."
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.380]   That's 1 Timothy 6, 17 and 18 and 19.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.920]   So here's the question.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   When these wealthy Christians have reckoned with the uncertainty of riches, set their
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:49.960]   hope in God, have done good, have been rich in good works, have been generous, have been
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.680]   ready to share, have taken hold of life that doesn't consist in possessions, what do
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.520]   you think is left for them to live on?
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:07.640]   Well, right, it doesn't say, which is why I have never precisely specified what degree
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.520]   of luxury is destructive to spiritual life and witness.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:22.400]   On the other hand, as I read the New Testament, I think it is my job as a biblical voice trying
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.560]   to be faithful to what's there to disturb the wealthy, including John Piper, especially
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   him, by drawing attention to the ways that the New Testament relentlessly pushes us toward
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.920]   simplicity and economy for the sake of gospel advance and away from luxury and affluence
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.080]   and finery.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.440]   So let me push in the other direction from Kevin when he says this, "I presume that
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.560]   a wealthy Christian could live in an 8,000 square foot, $2 million mansion, drive a new
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.640]   BMW, and still have their hopes set on God, the giver of all things, as they magnify Christ
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.200]   in their honest business dealings."
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.800]   Now my response to this is to push in the opposite direction, knowing that there are
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:30.460]   far more powerful ways to magnify Christ than through honest business dealings, as good
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:38.600]   as that is, and knowing that there are many other passages of Scripture that ought to
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.760]   get under the skin of those of us who want to surround ourselves with vastly more than
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.600]   we need.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.720]   So here's one way to show what I mean.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.800]   Jesus said in Luke 18.24 how hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.220]   kingdom of heaven.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.680]   He did not say how hard it will be for those who love riches to get into the kingdom of
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   heaven.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.520]   In other words, it's a warning about the danger of being rich, not just wanting to
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.240]   be rich.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   Now why would that be?
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.960]   Why would Jesus say that?
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.440]   Why does wealth make it hard to get into heaven?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.800]   Why is being wealthy dangerous?
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   And let me mention four biblical pointers to why that would be.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:33.760]   Number one, the parable of the soils says, or Jesus warns in Luke 8.14 in the parable,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.880]   "People are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures are not neutral."
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.600]   They have a tendency to choke the vitality of radical Christian living.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:54.080]   So the word to the rich, like me, should never be merely, "Oh, you're okay if you're
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   honest."
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   Well, actually, you're not necessarily okay.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.840]   You're in danger.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:08.260]   Number two, Jesus said in Luke 14.33, "Whoever does not renounce all that he has cannot be
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.260]   my disciple."
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.720]   Now, of course, from all the other texts, we know this doesn't mean that Christians
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.400]   don't own anything.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.960]   It means they are radically free from the control of possessions and always ready to
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.840]   do the most life-threatening acts of obedience.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:36.360]   But the more accustomed we become to the lap of luxury, the more difficult this is, and
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.120]   the less it looks to outsiders as if we are, in fact, that free from things.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.960]   And that ought to matter to us.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.800]   It ought to matter to us what inferences people might be drawing.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.680]   Number three, in Philippians 1.20, Paul said that his goal in life was that Christ would
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.640]   be magnified in his body, whether by life or by death.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:09.200]   In other words, he wanted to live and die in a way that would appear to the world that
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:17.840]   Christ was magnificent to him, more satisfying than possessions or life.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:25.600]   And to that end, he said in chapter 3, he counts everything as lost rubbish because
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.840]   of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.160]   In other words, we don't just magnify Christ by being honest in our business dealings.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:44.500]   We magnify Christ by living in such a way that communicates to the world that Christ
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:51.960]   is more valuable to us than houses and cars and lands and life itself.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.840]   Which brings us finally to the fourth pointer to why it's hard for the rich to enter heaven,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:08.240]   namely that the motives for pursuing symbols of wealth, whether we think of them that way
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:15.720]   or not they are, whether those motives are pure.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.540]   It is difficult to keep them pure, very difficult.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:28.280]   So back to the $2 million mansion or a house here in Lake Minnetonka that yesterday went
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:38.540]   on sale in my area for $15 million, why would a Christian whose treasure is in heaven and
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.160]   whose life is devoted to doing as much good as he can and whose desire is to show the
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:53.200]   world that Christ is more precious than things, why would a Christian want to look like riches
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.700]   are his treasure?
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.360]   What would be the motive for buying such a mansion and surrounding yourself with more
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.520]   and more and more than you need?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.400]   Maybe I should end with just one more question for the mansion owner.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.740]   Who are you going to leave it to when you die?
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:21.880]   I mean, if you have experienced the miracle of treasuring Christ above all things and
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:30.080]   of living for the good of others, do you think that handing off all this wealth to others
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.120]   will help them experience that miracle?
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.640]   Do you think it will do your children good to make them wealthy or to put a palace in
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.840]   the hands of some ministry?
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.800]   My position is this.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:55.060]   Without specifying what measure of wealth is destructive to the soul or to our witness,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:02.720]   the New Testament relentlessly pushes us toward simplicity and economy for the sake of the
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   gospel and away from luxury and affluence.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.080]   Thanks, Pastor John, I appreciate it.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.740]   And Kevin, thank you for the honest question.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.580]   Those are really helpful to us in the podcast that they make it possible, right?
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.940]   And thank you all for joining us today.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.120]   You can ask a question of your own.

[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.480]   Well we are hardwired to root our happiness in our circumstances.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.960]   We are happiest when things are going well.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.240]   We are saddest when things are going badly.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.720]   Our mood is determined by our circumstances.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   It shouldn't be that way.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.480]   So how can we escape from this emotional rollercoaster of circumstances?
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.160]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:50.520]   See you then.
