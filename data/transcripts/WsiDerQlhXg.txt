[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Verses 12 and 13 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   We are still considering this great statement in which we are reminded
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   that the Son of God came from heaven to earth, the Word was made flesh,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   the incarnation took place and all that followed it,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   in order that you and I might be made and become the sons or the children of God.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   It is the most wonderful thing.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   There is nothing we can ever hear that rises beyond this statement.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We are not merely forgiven as Christians.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   We are not only reconciled to God.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We are adopted into the family of God.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We are the children of God.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And we are destined to enter into a great and a glorious inheritance
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   of which we are now the fellow heirs with our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And what we are trying to do these Sunday mornings is to bring ourselves to a realization of that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   This is no mere statement that is made to us.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We are meant to know it. We are meant to believe it.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We are meant to be assured of it.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We are meant to rejoice in it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And that is why we are taking all this time to try to bring this truth home.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It seems to me it still needs to be brought home to us.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We don't sing as if we believe this.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Do you really know that you have been taken up from a miry pit,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   a horrible pit and a miry clay?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Do you really know that that's true of you?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, if we do believe these things and if we know them, we are bound to express it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   If you've had some narrow escape in a car accident,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   if you were desperately ill and your life was just saved,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   well, you let everybody know about it, don't you?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And you speak with any mission. There's a thrill in your voice.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Is there a thrill in our voice as we realize this still greater thing?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We are not meant to mourn as Christians. We are meant to be rejoicing people.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   "Rejoice in the Lord always," says the great apostle.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And again I say, "Rejoice."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But my dear friends, it's not my business to make you rejoice.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   If our rejoicing is only something that I or anybody else can produce,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   it's not true rejoicing.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What produces rejoicing is a realization of the truth.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And therefore our state and condition spiritually is a measure of our realization of this most wonderful truth.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That is why, you see, we have to spend all this time in going through all this.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   A church which is languishing and mourning is a travesty.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's an insult to the name of God.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's not surprising the masses of the people are outside the church.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   They seem to have all the thrill and the laughter.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   They seem to have all the excitement.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Listen to them at the football matches or at their races.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   How keen they are on what they've got. How excited, how animated.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And look at us.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Now, my friends, these things ought not to be so.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The church is giving the impression to the people outside that she's uncertain of her truth,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   uncertain of her faith.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   We give the impression that we are a burdened people looking for something,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   not people who've been given the gift of eternal life and sonship of God
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and heirship of the eternal bliss.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Very well, then, this makes it all very necessary that we should be spending this time
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   in making sure, as we're trying to do, that we are the children of God.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This isn't just a phrase, a statement. We are to know this.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And we are to let everybody else know it.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We're always ready to boast, all of us, aren't we?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   We boast of our birth, we boast of our family, we boast of our brains,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   we boast of our achievements, we boast of what we call good luck
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   or something wonderful that's happened to us.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And here's the greatest thing of all.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And we seem to be doubtful and hesitant and almost apologetic.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I'm concerned about all this, as I'm trying to say,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   not merely that you and I, my dear friends, may enter into the riches
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   that are put at our disposal by God in Christ,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   but the whole situation of the church and the world should rouse us,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   every one of us, to a sense of our responsibility
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   at this grievous, evil day in which we find ourselves.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Now, then, let's go on with this.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And we are trying to know for certain whether we are being led by the Spirit of God.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   If we are sure that we are being led by the Spirit of God,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   well, then there's no doubt about it, we are the children of God.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So, this is a very good way of examining ourselves.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And we've been looking at the various ways in which the Spirit does lead us.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And we've arrived at this particular way, namely,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   the work of the Spirit and the leading of the Spirit
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   in the matter of what the Scriptures call the mortification of the deeds of the body.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We are no longer debtors to the flesh, says the apostle,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   because if we live after the flesh we shall die,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   but if we through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   then shall we live.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And we are looking at this great subject.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We've looked at it negatively and we are now looking at it positively.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And we've been doing that also for two or three Sundays.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And we've arrived at this point now that we see that there are
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   certain things that we have to do in practice and in detail.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The most important thing of all, of course, is to realize the truth about ourselves.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Reckon ye yourselves therefore to be dead indeed unto sin,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and alive unto God through Jesus Christ.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That's not a bit of cohesion, that's a fact.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Realize it.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   This teaching which says you've already believed that Christ has died for you,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   now then take a second step and die with him.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's not scriptural. We have died with him.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's what Paul is saying. Realize that you have died with him.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You don't have to be crucified. You have been crucified.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Don't try to crucify the old man.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   If you're a Christian, the old man has died with him, has been crucified with him.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   What we are exalted to do is to realize that these things are true.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   To make certain that we do grasp that, reckon it, realize its truth.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You have been crucified. You have died to sin.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And you are risen to newness of life with him in the presence of God.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Very well. But then you have to apply all this, I say, in detail.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And we were looking last Sunday at this whole question of the very surrender of the body.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Present your body as a living sacrifice.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Every faculty, every power, that every propensity that you have
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   is to be given to the glory of God and in his service.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   There it is. But now we must proceed from that.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The next great principle, it seems to me, in this matter is
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that we may finish this whole matter of the mortification of the flesh of the deeds of the body.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The next great principle in connection with it is
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   the importance of realizing that we must constantly practice these things.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   That this is something that we've got to go on doing.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And it is very necessary that that should be emphasized.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Now, I can put this matter to you most conveniently, it seems to me, this morning
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   by just opening to you again the two portions of Scripture
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   which we've read together at the beginning.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And we'll take them in the reverse order from that in which we read them.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Let's look first of all at what we are told by the apostle Peter
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   in his second epistle and in his first chapter.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Here is the precise doctrine which you've got in Romans 6
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   put with Peter's own characteristic emphasis.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You see, he starts off by telling them in the first four verses
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   of who and what they are and what is possible to them.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He says, "You've received like precious faith with us
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Very well. What else?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Well, he says, "According to his divine power he hath given unto us
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   all things that pertain unto life and godliness
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Now then, here you see is what we are told.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Everything that is necessary to our life and godliness
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   is already available for us in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   That was our last point last Sunday morning.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   That the power is already given us.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The power of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling Christ.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   That is true of all Christians.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Very well then, we have the power.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Then he goes on, "Whereby he says are given unto us
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   exceeding great and precious promises
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Now there it is, you see, always the first thing.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   We have already escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   The world is corrupt as the result of lust.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And the world is corrupt.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Is there anybody who doubts that any longer?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Is there anybody who thinks that life is wonderful and this world is wonderful?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   The world is corrupt.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And it is corrupt as the result of lust.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And there it is shouting at us, "But," says the apostle,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "you've escaped all that.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You've been taken out of it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The power and excellency of God has delivered you out of that
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and you are now in this new realm and in this new kingdom."
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   That's our position, you see.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   As Paul starts with the position,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   "Reckon ye yourselves therefore to be dead indeed unto sin."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   You're no longer there in that mess of corruption.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   You've been taken out of it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You're alive unto God.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Here it is, "partakers of the divine nature."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Very well.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now then, there you see is the point we've been making each Sunday,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   that we start with the realization that there is the truth about us,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   that is our spiritual condition, that is our spiritual position.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   What about it?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Now then, "And beside all this," verse 5,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   which means, "because of all this, in the light of all this,"
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   you see that's only the beginning.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It's an essential beginning, but you don't stop at that.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   He says, "Because that is true."
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   What are you to do?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Oh, well, having received Christ for your justification by faith,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   all you've got to do now is to take the second step.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Take your sanctification by faith in exactly the same way.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   As you didn't struggle for your justification,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   you mustn't struggle for your sanctification.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You mustn't do anything.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   You just let go.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You let God do it all.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   You hand it all over.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Is that it?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Listen, "Beside all this, giving all diligence,"
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   concentrating all your powers,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   taking yourself in hand and making yourself do it,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   you giving all diligence,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   "add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and to brotherly kindness charity."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now, that is what you and I have got to do.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You don't just go to meetings and wait for it to come to you,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   or something to happen to you.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   No, no.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   "Giving all diligence, add."
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And that means, of course, "furnish out with, supplement with."
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We needn't bother about the word.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It's an interesting word used in connection with the Greek drama.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   You had your drama.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Well, then they came to the stage when they felt this must be furnished, as it were, elaborated.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So they introduced the chorus.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And that was the whole origin of the Greek chorus in the drama.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   You furnish out your play, your drama.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Fill it out, as it were.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Make it more artistic, more presentable, not so bold.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's the notion behind this word.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So you must add to your faith or furnish out your faith with these various qualities,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   which he goes on to enumerate.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Now, I'm not concerned so much this morning with looking at these things
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   which we are to add to our faith or to work our faith out in respect of.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   That's the meaning.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I'm concerned, rather, to show the importance of our doing this
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and the realization that we must do this.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   What the apostle is saying, in other words, is this.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Very well, here you are.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You are a Christian.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You've received this like precious faith
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   through the righteousness of God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Now then, here you are. You are no longer in the world.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   You are no longer in that corruption.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   You are a new man in Christ Jesus, and you are in this new life,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   which is a life of faith from beginning to end.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Very well, now then, he says, don't stop at that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   You don't stay there.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Well, what do you do?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Well, he says, work that out. Work it out.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You've got to work your faith out now with this diligence,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and it does need diligence. You've got to pay attention to it.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It doesn't happen to you. Nobody can do it for you.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Preaching can stimulate you to do it, but it can't do it for you.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   The preacher can't give you the experience. You've got to do it yourself.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You've got to add, giving all diligence, you've got to work this out.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   The business of preaching is to stimulate us and to urge us to do that.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Now then, this has got to be worked out, he says, in terms of virtue and in terms of knowledge.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   How little we know, how little we know of the Scriptures.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Well, very well, study them. Get books which will help you to study them.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Read them. Digest them. Grapple with them.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Don't say you haven't got time.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Don't think that because you've read just five or six verses and a little comment on it,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   that you've done everything.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   That doesn't take much diligence, does it?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   No, no, this means application. It means thoroughness.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It means real hard work.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   You've got to take yourself in hand and discipline yourself.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You've got to curb yourself. You've got to do anything you like that wakes you up.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Put a wet towel around your head if necessary.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Read your Bible standing rather than sitting. Do anything.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Give all diligence, only that you add to your faith virtue and then knowledge and temperance,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   control, to temperance, patience, to patience, godliness, and to godliness,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity, or love.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   What he means, you see, is this, that all along we've got to be exercising this faith of ours
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and working it out along various lines and constantly practicing it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Very well, let's go on and follow his argument, because he knew the people to whom he was writing.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "For," he says, "if these things be in you and upon,"
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   in other words, if you do this, if you do show this great diligence,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and if you do furnish out your faith with these other qualities,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   "if these things be in you and abound, then they make you
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   What does that mean? Well, it means this.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   He says, you know, it's possible for you to be a Christian, but rather a useless Christian.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   You can be a barren Christian. You can be an unfruitful Christian.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   It's got to be granted that you are a Christian.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You are in God's orchard, as it were. You're no longer in that wilderness where you were.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   You've been transplanted. You're in the orchard, but you're a very poor specimen.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   There isn't much fruit on you, and you're not much help, nor much use to anybody else.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   You're barren. You're unfruitful. Yes, you are a Christian,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   but nobody else derives very much benefit from that, nor much encouragement from it.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   A miserable-looking tree in an orchard, many of the trees bearing wonderful crops of fruit,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   of great value and of great help to others. Now look here, says Peter,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   if you are a barren and an unfruitful Christian, there's only one explanation.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   You are not giving all diligence to furnish out your faith as you should do.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You're sitting down and waiting for something to happen to you.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You're waiting, and you've been doing it all your life,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and you're as bad now as you were twenty and thirty years ago.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   You think you need a new experience. That isn't what you need.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   You need to shake yourself, to pull yourself together, to begin to apply yourself,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   to begin to be diligent in the furnishing out of your faith. That's your trouble.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But if you do this, he says, you'll no longer be barren or unfruitful
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the most wonderful thing.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You see, the more you know, the more you do these things,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   the greater the blessings you receive. It's inevitable, isn't it?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   If that old tree there isn't bearing much fruit, well, you begin to examine it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   You say, what's the matter? The other trees are bearing very well.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   What's the matter with this one?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And then you look, and you see perhaps that the ground, the earth,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   around the base of the tree is too hard.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Well, you say, I must get hold of my fork, and I must dig this up and loosen the soil a bit.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's what you do. You're giving diligence. It'll take effort.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   You may perspire as you do it, but it doesn't matter.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   You want the tree to bear fruit, so you do that.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And if there's anything wrong with it, well, you apply the appropriate remedies,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and you may add a little manure. Probably it needs a little,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   or some artificial salt or chemical or something that's necessary.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You find that there's something wrong in the conditions, so you deal with them.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You dig it and put in your manure, and you begin to find the old tree lifting up its head, as it were,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   and it'll bear fruit in the following seasons.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   That's precisely what the apostles say.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   But you see, my friends, it's you and I who've got to do this.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It isn't done for us.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The whole emphasis of the New Testament is that the Christian has got to do these things.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Of course, the unbeliever can't justify himself. The unbeliever's dead.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You don't ask him to do these things.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But here is a man who's been given life into the exceeding great and precious promises,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and he's a partaker of the divine nature,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and all things that pertain to life and godliness are already given to him.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And there he sits, waiting for something to happen.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It's a denial of the New Testament teaching.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   No, no. You go on and do this, says Peter, and you'll no longer be barren nor unfruitful
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   The more you do, the more you'll get, the more you'll know him,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   the more you'll manifest it in your life, and the greater benefit you'll be to others.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But then he goes on. It isn't enough just to leave it like that.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   But he that lacketh these things,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   that's to say the man who doesn't show the diligence and furnish out the faith,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   he that lacketh these things, he is blind,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and he cannot see afar off,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   He's forgotten that.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   He's forgotten that he has been purged from his old sins.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Not only that he doesn't realize where he's going,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   he's content with the fact that he's now what he calls a believer,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and he believes his sins are forgiven.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And there he's stopped.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   He hasn't realized the full meaning of salvation.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Salvation includes being purged from your old sins,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   being taken from the corruption that is in the world through lust,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   a translation from the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Salvation includes all that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   This man's forgotten that.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And there he is, as it were, living just outside the realm of corruption,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   as near to it as he can.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   He doesn't want to be in it, of course. He doesn't want to go to hell.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   No, no. But he stops just outside the realm of corruption, the world.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   He hasn't realized that he's been taken right out of it.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   But he doesn't see afar off. He's blind.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   He doesn't see what he is in Christ.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   He doesn't see the glory of the kingdom of God.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   He doesn't see the wonderful things that are being prepared for him in heaven.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   He's blind and he cannot see afar off,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   My dear friends, this is the whole secret.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   We will persist in living from day to day and from hour to hour.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And we consult our feelings and our moods and our states, and they govern us.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And so we spend our days in shallows and in miseries.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   We've got to pull ourselves up, I say, and say to ourselves,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   "Look here, you've been delivered from the corruption that is in the world through lust.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   You've been purged from your old sins, your dead sins.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Not only that, don't you see where you're going?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Don't think of just today. Don't think in terms of time.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   In a sense, you're out of there.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   You are now a citizen of the kingdom of God. Heaven is your home.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Our citizenship is there. Very well, then.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Live as a man who's got his eye upon that.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Open your eyes. Don't be blind.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Don't look into some perpetual mist.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   See the eternal glories gleaming afar. Look at them.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Set your affections upon things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Make yourself see them, because they're there.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And they're there for you.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Don't be blind.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Don't be like somebody who's short-sighted.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Realize that in Christ there is this power to cleanse your eye,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   give power, as it were, to your optic nerve,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   and enable you to see the things that are invisible.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Be like Moses.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   He endured as seeing him who is invisible.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   That's it. The paradox.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   The glorious paradox of Christian living.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Very well, there it is. That's how he goes on.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You see, he's trying to show them the utter reasonableness of all this.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's an argument. Peter can argue as well as Paul.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I say by, what I mean by that is that he argues in the same way as Paul argues.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's a much simpler argument always with Peter, but it's the same essential argument.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Very well, let's go on.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   What else does he say?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Wherefore, the rather.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Don't be blind. Don't be short-sighted, he says, but rather brethren.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Back comes the same word again.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Give diligence.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Give diligence.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   To make your calling and election sharp.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And that doesn't mean that you've got to save yourself.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   What he means by making your calling and election sure is this.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   You have been called by God, you're elect of God.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Very well, he says, if you do the things I'm telling you, you'll know that.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That's what he means. You make it sure to yourself.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   You don't make your calling and election sure.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   If our eternal destiny depended upon us,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   well, not a single one of us would ever reach heaven.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Is it likely that we would reach heaven?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Are we giving diligence to get there?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Thank God what guarantees my heaven this morning is that I'm called and elected of God.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   But I'm meant to enjoy that knowledge. I'm meant to know it.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So I make my calling and election sure to myself
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   by giving this diligence and adding to my faith, virtue, and knowledge and so on.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And it's the only way.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Wherefore there are the brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   For if you do these things, you shall never fall.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   You've got to do them, remember.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   If you do them, you shall never fall.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But not only that.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   It all means the same thing.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It means that when you come to lie on your deathbed,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   you won't be filled with doubts and uncertainty.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   You won't say, "I wonder where I'm going.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Am I truly a Christian or not?"
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   You won't die in an agony of doubt and of uncertainty and just hoping.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   No, no. You do these things and an abundant entry.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   The flags will be flying.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The hooters will all be sounding.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   It'll be a glorious, triumphant entry into the everlasting God.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Our people die well, said John Wesley, and he was right.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Because the great doctrine of Methodism in all its sections was the doctrine of assurance.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That was the keynote of 200 years ago in the great evangelical awakening.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Whitefield and Wesley and all the others who worked with them,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   they were always preaching assurance, certainty.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And the result was that when their people came to die,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   they didn't die in fear and terror and doubt and alarm,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   hoping that they were saved.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   They knew, "I know whom I have believed,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   An abundant entry shall be ministered unto you
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Now then, my friends, that's the argument of the great apostle.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   That we've got to realize these things and then we proceed to put them into practice.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And it calls us to exercise this diligence and to furnish out our faith in that particular way and manner.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Well, there's the argument as it is presented by the apostle Peter.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Now then, let's go and look at the argument as it's presented by the apostle Paul.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It's almost exactly the same thing, but it's put in different language.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And I say again, the important thing for us to grasp here is the principle.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Work out the details at your leisure.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Get hold of the principle.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Here it is.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Now, he starts off in the 16th verse of the 5th chapter of the epistle to the Galatians
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   by a general exhortation.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   "This I say to you," here it is, "here's your principle.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Walk in the Spirit and you shall not, you will not, fulfill the lust of the flesh."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Now, there's a categorical statement and it's absolutely right.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   The whole secret, he says, is this.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Walk in the Spirit, which means live in the Spirit.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Be occupied with the Spirit, it's a general statement.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Spend your life in the Spirit.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Live your life in the Spirit.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   You see, it's just another way of saying, "Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Ye are no longer in the flesh, but in the Spirit."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Same thing, exactly the same thing.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   But now he says this is a great principle.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And he says it works in a very interesting way.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He says this is inevitably true for this reason.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And these are contrary the one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Very well, it means this.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Realize, he says, that you are now as a Christian in this position. This is how you are, as it were, constituted.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   You're a new man, you died with Christ, you're dead to sin, you're dead to the law.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   You have risen to newness of life with Christ.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   You are indeed seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus at this moment.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Nevertheless, you are still in the body, you are still in this world.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And because you are still in the body, the flesh is still left.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   The flesh means the wrong use of the body.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   That's a good definition of the flesh.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I was dealing with that last Sunday morning, I needn't go back over that again.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   All that we have in the body, all our instincts, etc., are given to us by God.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   They are not sinful. Sex is not sinful.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   None of the instincts are sinful.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   It is the wrong use of them that is sinful. That's the flesh.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Very well.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   He says, "Now that is true of you, there is still the flesh remaining in you."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   "And that is something that will always militate against the life of the Spirit who is also in you."
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And he says, "These two things are contrary, the one to the other."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   "They fight against one another."
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   "The Spirit is there to uplift you and to bring you to God."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   "The flesh tends to hold you to earth."
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "And reminds you of the corruption out of which you've been delivered."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Now then, says the apostle, you've got to realize that these two things are opposites.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But that in some strange sort of way, they're connected together.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And so it works like this, he says,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "If you give way to the flesh, the flesh will be prominent and the Spirit will be out of sight."
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "But if you walk in the Spirit, the flesh will go back and be out of sight."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Now the obvious illustration is that of these little weather indicators,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   weather glasses, call them what you will, which you can buy in the shops at the seaside generally.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   You know they have a little cottage and there's a little man made of wood and a little woman made of wood.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And they're on the same piece of wood.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And the woman comes out when there's fine weather.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   The man comes out when there's bad weather.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And they're never out at the same time, it's impossible.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's either the one or the other.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   They're on a pivot, you see.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And the one's out, the other must be in.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   But if the other's out, well then the first must be in.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   There it is. The apostle's saying it's like that.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   If you walk in the Spirit, well you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   But if you fulfill the lust of the flesh, the life of the Spirit in you will be correspondingly out of sight.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   These two things are opposites.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And they cannot go together.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   The Spirit lusteth against the flesh and the flesh lusteth against the Spirit.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And it's a question of warfare and of strife.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   That is always true of the Christian.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   The New Testament never tells you anywhere that there will be an end to that warfare while you're in this world.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   What the New Testament tells us is how to deal with it.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And the way to deal with it is to walk in the Spirit.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And then you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Ah, but you say, I've been waiting for years for an experience which will take the flesh out of me.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   My friend, you'll go on waiting.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   You may get some psychological experience that will relieve you in one or two respects perhaps.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   But you'll never get rid of the flesh.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   The body is not going to be delivered until the end, the resurrection.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Then there shall be glory even for the body.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But while we are here, it is there.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And we've got this struggle.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And we overcome by walking in the Spirit.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   So he says what you've got to do is to realize that this is the position.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And the moment you realize it, you then walk in the Spirit.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And so you will not be fulfilling the lust of the flesh.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And don't we all know this to be perfectly true?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   When you are walking in the Spirit and giving diligence to do the things that Peter tells us to do,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   you don't get worried so much by the flesh, do you?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   When you're in a spiritual atmosphere,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   when you're reading your Bible and reading good books about the Bible,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and you are uplifted, these things seem hateful and abhorrent.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   But if you neglect these things, the flesh seems attractive again.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   This is just simply experience. It's inevitable.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   It works on this pivot, this swivel.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And there it is, as long as we're here, flesh and Spirit.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Very well, he says, walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Not only realize that, but realize the opposite also.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   And then he goes on to make a very interesting statement.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   But he says, if you be led of the Spirit,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   see, this is the fundamental text, leading of the Spirit,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   but if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   What's he mean by that?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Well, that's a very profound statement.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I can only give you the essence of the meaning of it this morning.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   But whoever has gone thoroughly through the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   knows exactly what it means.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   What it means is this.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   When a man is under the law, and he's only under the law as long as he's not a Christian,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   when he's under the law, he's very much under the domination of the flesh.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And the law, as the apostle points out in Romans 7, even seems to aggravate the whole problem.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   The motions of sin that were in me, stimulated by the law, he says,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   in the fifth verse of the seventh of Romans.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   The very law of God, he said, I found to be death unto me.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   In other words, while you're under the law, well, it's a hopeless contest.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   The flesh always wins while a man is under the law.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   That is why mere morality is finally always defeated.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   In this country, for the last fifty years, they've been trying to teach morality without Christianity.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   They've dropped the gospel and the doctrines of the gospel,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and they say, we want the ethics and the moral teaching of Jesus.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   It can't be done.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   You are under the law, and under the law you will always fail,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   because it always stimulates the flesh.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But, he says, you are no longer under the law.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   You're in a new condition.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And therefore, there is no inevitable failure.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   You've been taken out of that realm.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Not only that, but the power of the Spirit is in you.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And the power of the Spirit will give you strength.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And he puts this in an interesting way at the end of verse 23.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Giving there the list of the fruit of the Spirit, he says,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   against such there is no law, which is wonderful.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Do these, he says, and there'll be never any condemnation.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   There'll be joy and abandon and release and fullness.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   There's no law against things like this.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And he says, you are not under the law. Realize that.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   You're out of the realm of the flesh.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   To be under the law is to be in the flesh.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   To be in the Spirit means that you're no longer under the law.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Realize this. And realize the power of the Spirit that is in you.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   And then in order to drive it right home, he puts it like this.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Now he says, if this argument, he says, about the flesh and the Spirit is too much for you,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and if you say you can't follow this doctrine about being under the law and so on,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   well, very well, he says, let me come right down to your level
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and let me put it very simply and plainly and bluntly to you.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   He says, don't, don't live that life after the flesh. Why not?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Well, for this reason, the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Look at them. Works of the flesh.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   hatred, variance, emulations, rot, strife, seditions, heresies.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Well, we are beginning to learn something about heresies, aren't we?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Look at the ugliness of heresies. Look at them.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Mathematics is God. Heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, revelings and such like.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   They all belong to the same family. Have a look at them.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And then he says, having looked at them, can you go on doing things like that?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   You who are born of God and who are heirs of eternal bliss and who are citizens of the kingdom of heaven,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   look at the thing, look at the ugliness, the foulness of every single one of them,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   and they are all the same. They have got the family mark upon them.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   They are of the devil. They are of the flesh. Works of the flesh.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   See them for what they are, says the apostle, and you won't be able to go on doing them.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   But thank God he doesn't leave it at the negative. But, he says, look at the other side.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Oh, let me finish my quotation. Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And people who are guilty of those things, and don't forget that heresies is here amongst them.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Heresies as bad as adultery. A man who says that God isn't a person is a heretic.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He doesn't belong to the kingdom of God, whatever his position may be in the Christian church.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   He is a liar. He is a heretic. Such, there you do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   How can they? But he says, have a look at the other side.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Look at the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   faith, meekness, and temperance. You know, a Christian who is in any doubt as to how he should live,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   must be terribly blind. Look at that, look at this.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   There's no law against these. There's nothing here but the approbation of God.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Very well, then, he says, winding it all up.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   We dealt with that last Sunday. Now then, here's the final word.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it's so typical of Paul. Starts with a general statement, works out his argument, ends with a general statement.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Inevitable logic. If we live in the Spirit, and we do, we're Christians.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Well, then, let us also walk in the Spirit.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   You know, it really is as simple as that, but we don't seem to realize it, do we?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   If you live in the Spirit, well, then, walk in the Spirit.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Now, let me bring this right home by showing you an interesting thing.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   You notice in verse 16, he says, walk in the Spirit.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Here, again, we've got in the authorized version, if you live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   But in a most interesting way, the apostle used a different word when he came to verse 25.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   It's translated by the word "walk" in both cases here.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   It isn't quite right. It's very difficult to get a better word, I agree.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   But let me tell you the difference in the meaning of the two words.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   The word translated "walk" in verse 16, as I said, is a very general word.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It means "live in, be occupied with." In general, there you are. Do that.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   But here, it's a more particular word, a more detailed word.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   The word the apostle used here means this, to march in military rank, to keep step, to conform,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   to walk in an orderly manner. It was a military term.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   And you see the obvious character of the analogy, walk in step.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Don't be ahead or behind the men marching next to you. Keep the line, keep the column.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   March in military rank, keep the step, conform to the pattern, walk in an orderly manner.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   In other words, it's this whole question of discipline and of application.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   You see, the other was, well, live your life in general, in the Spirit, and you'll then not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   That's right, that's the general exhortation. But then, having taken us through all the details,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   he says, well, very well now then, in the light of that, keep your eye to the right and to the left,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   this man, that man, keep the line, keep the rank, be orderly, and watch and march with a steadfast,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   firm step, knowing what you're doing, with the band of heaven accompanying you and thrilling you as you go along,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   you're marching to Zion. Very well, keep the line. Don't look in the wrong directions.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Don't flag, don't be slack. Brace yourself up, all that is implied here.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   If we live in the Spirit, very well. Let us also walk in the Spirit.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Let anybody who happens to look on, standing on a pavement as we pass along, say, look at him,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   he's one of them. Look at all of them, how wonderful it is to see them.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Who are these people? Well, these are the Christians. There they are, marching, with heads erect,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   with a bright step, with a glory on their faces. They're the children of God, and they're marching to Zion.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Children of the heavenly King, as ye journey, sweetly sing, that's it.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Let it be known who you are. And in order to that, you've got to exercise this discipline,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   you've got to show this diligence, you've got to furnish out your faith,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   you've got to realize the nature of evil, you've got to realize the glory of the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   you've got to know who you are, you've got to keep your eye on the recompense of the reward,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and ever keep that as your first and your chiefest interest.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   May God enable us to grasp and to implement this inevitable logic of the Kingdom of God. Amen.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
