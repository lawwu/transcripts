[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Now, obviously, I don't like headlines of the market crashing.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.680]   I'd rather the market be up 10% or 20%.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.620]   However, one of the principles I adhere to is that all of the money that I have invested
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.060]   in the stock market is money that has at least a five-year horizon.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.620]   So if I have money that I need for a down payment, a tuition payment, anything really
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.000]   that I'm going to spend in the next five years, I keep that money in cash and not just 0%
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   cash, but cash in a bank account or money market fund or treasuries, anything in the
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.620]   market for me has a five-plus-year horizon.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.900]   That means that unless the market doesn't recover over the next five years, it being down 10%
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.320]   right now or 20% or 30% or whatever that number ends up being doesn't have a huge impact on
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.220]   my life other than whatever emotional toll I let it take on me while it's happening.
