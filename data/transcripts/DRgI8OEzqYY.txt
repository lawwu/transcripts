[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   So one of the biggest complaints I hear from people
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.440]   when it comes to the struggle to live and work deeply
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.460]   in an increasingly distracted world
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.880]   is that they don't feel like they have enough time
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.200]   to accomplish the things that are really important to them.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.480]   Maybe for example, you want to master
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.800]   some sort of difficult new skill in work,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.240]   which would then allow you to switch over to freelance work,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.200]   which would then allow you to work eight months a year
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   and take the other four months and travel the world
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280]   and surf, or maybe you're trying to get back
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.040]   in your non-professional life into excellent shape.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.280]   You want to start competing again
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400]   in amateur athletic competitions,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.720]   but you just don't have the time,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.420]   these key moves that could really unlock a deeper life.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.900]   You just never feel like you have the time
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.420]   to actually get them done.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.120]   Today, I want to talk about how to fix that problem.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.740]   All right, so what I'm going to do is identify three,
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.480]   what I call time destroyers.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.800]   So forces you might not be aware of
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   that is sapping your ability to find time
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.360]   for important priorities in your schedule each week.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.440]   We'll explain how they work
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560]   and then offer concrete advice for how to combat them.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.720]   All right, let me just say before we get going,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   a lot of these ideas actually come from my new book,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840]   "Slow Productivity."
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.800]   If you haven't gotten this book,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.520]   you probably should because it goes into more detail
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.000]   on a lot of the stuff we're talking about.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.900]   All right, time destroyer number one, overhead tax.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.440]   See, one of the biggest things
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.320]   that's making your schedule difficult
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.520]   is not the work you're doing
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.580]   on your projects and commitments.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.320]   It's the administrative overhead
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.600]   generated by those projects and commitments.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   Now, what I mean by administrative overhead is the emails,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.800]   it's the instant messages, it's the meetings,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.420]   it's the quick check-ins that surround your work
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.360]   on your projects and initiatives.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   These are the things that grab your time
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.920]   in a way that is much more destructive
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.720]   than just say concurrent hours spent cranking
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.260]   on a particular problem.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.400]   So when you have enough overhead tax,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.240]   so you're working on enough things
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.320]   that you should read overhead tax.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.840]   When you have enough overhead tax
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.760]   that it crosses a certain threshold of your day,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.560]   so a certain percentage of your time now
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.580]   is just servicing projects instead of working on them.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.680]   There's a threshold I call
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.360]   the excessive overhead threshold.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.280]   When you pass that, disaster follows.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.600]   Your work becomes mind numbing,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.180]   it becomes fatiguing and it becomes exhausting.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.440]   So if you have a sufficient amount of overhead tax
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.080]   in your day and you pass the excessive overhead threshold,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.880]   it becomes very difficult to make progress
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.360]   on non-urgent but important priorities.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.040]   All right, so we have to make sure
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.840]   that you do not cross the excessive overhead threshold.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   A lot of ideas about what you can do about this.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.560]   I'll go through this really quickly.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.220]   Number one, say no to more things.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.820]   Everything you say yes to brings with it
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.400]   some overhead tax.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.640]   This aggregates.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.920]   If you do not want this sum
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.160]   to get past that excessive threshold,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   you can't add as many things onto your plate.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.440]   So you have to be more confident saying no to things.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.600]   I think we often overestimate in our mind
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.360]   what's gonna happen when we say no.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240]   We often, in our mind's eye,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.360]   imagine that this colleague who just came to us
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   to ask if we would jump on this committee or whatever
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.640]   had just spent the last six hours
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.560]   desperately wanting, thinking about it,
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.200]   desperately saying like, what's gonna happen?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.160]   I hope Cal says yes.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.240]   My whole life depends on this.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.560]   That when he left work for that work this morning,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.160]   he said to his wife, wish me luck,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.580]   or we really need Cal to say yes to this,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.720]   that on the way to work, everyone he saw was like,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.640]   hey, good luck today getting Cal to say yes to this.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.880]   So if you say no, it's gonna be some disaster.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.920]   The reality is he remembered to ask you
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.880]   that two minutes before,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   and will forget you said no two minutes after.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.040]   So say no to more things.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   Two, have quotas.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.880]   For certain types of work that's important that you do
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.920]   and it comes up again and again, have quotas.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.480]   I do this, but I don't do more than this many.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.960]   I speak, but I don't do more
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680]   than one speaking event a month.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.280]   I do reviews, but I don't review
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.680]   more than four papers a semester.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   I can join working groups at my company,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.320]   but I only can be on one working group at a time.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.200]   So you set quotas.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.680]   So you're still doing the things that are important,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.080]   but you're not doing too many of them.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.960]   Because it's very easy,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.240]   if you say one of these activities is important,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.080]   it's easy then to never say no.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.040]   'Cause you say, well, wait a second,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.880]   it's important that I sit on working groups.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.680]   It's important that I review papers.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.040]   So how can I say no?
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.480]   And then you say yes to so many
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880]   that the overhead tax overwhelms you.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.720]   So quotas is a way to still do the things
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.560]   that are important,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   but do it at a level that is reasonable.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.920]   A big idea we've talked about several times now on the show,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.000]   and I really detail in "Slow Productivity"
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   is differentiate between projects
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.160]   that you're actively working on
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.040]   versus projects that you're waiting to work on.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   So these are the things you've said yes to.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   But among the things you've said yes to,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   only designate two or three
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000]   to be actively receiving your attention,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.920]   everything else you're waiting on.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.960]   Only tolerate overhead tax for the active projects.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.440]   You'll do emails and meetings and calls and make progress.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.600]   The other things are waiting.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.160]   And when you finish one of these projects
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.400]   that you're actively working on,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.520]   you pull in something new from the waiting list.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.680]   So you may have said yes to 10 projects,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.000]   but only two or three of them
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.040]   are generating overhead tax at the same time.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   So you don't have to say no to people,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.480]   but you can prevent tripping
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.080]   over the excessive overhead threshold.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.920]   Now, the key is,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.440]   if someone tries to generate some administrative overhead
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.680]   for something that's in the waiting queue,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.520]   you just say to them,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.200]   "Oh, I'm not working on that yet."
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.280]   In fact, you can point them towards your queue,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.360]   put it in a shared document.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.920]   Here's the things I'm actively working on.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.240]   Here's the ordered queue of things I'm waiting to work on.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.200]   You can see exactly where you are in that order.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.920]   And as soon as it gets to the top of the list,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.320]   I'll pull it over and I'll let you know.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   We can have calls and meetings, we'll take care of it,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.440]   but I only do overhead on the stuff I'm actively working on.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.960]   So it's a way that if you can't say no,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080]   you can still reduce overhead tax.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.400]   Finally, here's a new idea.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.580]   Consider dedicating different roles to different days.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.900]   A lot of people in their job
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.800]   implicitly have multiple roles that they do.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.580]   There's maybe some managerial role,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.840]   there's a project lead role,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.440]   there's a role they do with an unrelated responsibility
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.240]   around client management.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.920]   You have multiple roles at your job.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.020]   Professors often have roles as researchers, teachers,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.880]   and service-oriented department members.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.860]   These are like different roles with different types of work.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.880]   Consider dedicating different days to different roles.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.760]   Wednesday is my day, I work on this role.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.640]   So I'm only dealing with administrative overhead
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   related to that role on this day.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.000]   A lot of professors, for example,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.360]   will make the days they teach,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   days that they dedicate entirely to the teaching role.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.560]   So they'll answer emails and have meetings and get into it,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.280]   but they don't engage in administrative overhead
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.380]   related to their courses on the other days.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.300]   So by just consolidating administrative overhead
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.920]   to particular days,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.140]   you prevent any one day
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.240]   from having everything fall on your head.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   Again, you're kind of hacking
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   the excessive overhead threshold here.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   You're not reducing the number of things
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   that are generating overhead,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.220]   but you're preventing all this overhead
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.720]   from hitting you all at once.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.520]   All right, time destroyer number two.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.780]   Schedule fragmentation.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.840]   So we often think that the key resource
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.080]   for getting things done,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.940]   for making progress on things that are important to us,
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.000]   is the amount of time we have available to do it, right?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680]   So you would think what matters is when I look at my week
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.040]   and I've already got a bunch of stuff scheduled,
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.320]   I should just count up the minutes that are unscheduled.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.760]   And if, as long as I have enough time there,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.280]   I can dedicate that to making progress on non-urgent,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   but important priorities,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.880]   the stuff that you need to make your deep life deep.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.160]   That's not the right metric though.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.240]   Once you understand how the human mind works,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.880]   you realize the right metric is actually
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.080]   non-trivially length blocks of undistracted time.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.260]   That is the key unit that transforms the useful progress.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.080]   You give me an hour of uninterrupted time,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   I can make progress on something.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.880]   You give me six, 10 minute blocks that are highly distracted
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.820]   and in between other things going on, that's useless to me.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.320]   That doesn't add up to the same
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.080]   as having 60 uninterrupted minutes
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.240]   to actually work on something.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   So the actual, the fragmentation of your schedule matters
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.120]   just as much as the amount of free time
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.500]   that you actually find in that schedule.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.340]   So the problem,
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.580]   why do we end up with schedules that are fragmented?
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.680]   Well, we tend to have no constraints
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.560]   on how we schedule things.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.000]   If there's an incoming request,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.620]   we typically think about this as here's the game.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.720]   There's an incoming request.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.160]   The game is won if we can find a time
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.920]   that works for both of us.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.880]   So any time that is currently free
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.440]   when an incoming request comes in
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   is fair game for scheduling that request.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.120]   As a result, you're essentially simulating
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.360]   a random distribution of meetings and appointments
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.760]   on your free time throughout the week.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.000]   It's as if, for example,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.240]   you put up a big calendar on your wall
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200]   with a space for every free hour
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.600]   and you started throwing darts at it.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.520]   And where those darts hit is where you're putting meetings.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.400]   You're getting a sort of uniform distribution
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.900]   to use a statistical term.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.560]   Well, the thing about uniform distributions
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.540]   is you're unlikely to have lots of long swaths
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.980]   of uninterrupted time, right?
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.360]   Because things are gonna be more evenly spread out.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.600]   So if you have no constraints about how you schedule things,
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.840]   you're gonna really fragment your schedule.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.240]   And so the free time you do have
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.220]   is gonna be highly unusable.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.460]   So what's the solutions here?
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.680]   One, you have to constrain that spray.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   Do not make every free minute equally available
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.360]   for scheduling meetings.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.520]   You need more constraints on it.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   There's lots of ways to do this.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.620]   Here's one way.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.560]   I don't schedule meetings
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.440]   during the first two and a half hours of the day.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.720]   Okay, now you know that time will always be free
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.040]   for making progress on things.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.880]   Here's another way.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.200]   I don't do meetings on Mondays.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.140]   So now you know your Mondays are gonna be free.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.980]   Here's another thing.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.840]   This type of scheduling,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.040]   like this type of meeting I'm commonly asked to do,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.800]   I only do these on these afternoons.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.920]   This type of thing I'm often asked to do,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.420]   I only do them on these days, right?
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.640]   Another way to constrain spray,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.580]   and this is another idea from slow productivity,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.000]   is the one for you, one for me model.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   For every hour of time I schedule for a given week,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.740]   I will immediately find another hour to schedule to protect.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.400]   Therefore, there can't be any more than a 50/50 ratio
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.440]   of free time to schedule time.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.580]   And more importantly,
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.260]   because you're scheduling free time blocks
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260]   of equal duration to the meetings you just scheduled,
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.060]   they're not fragmented.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.580]   If I schedule a 90-minute meeting,
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.580]   I'm protecting a 90-minute uninterrupted free time block.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.880]   So it right away gets rid of the fragmentation.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.000]   You can, of course, adjust that ratio.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.220]   You know, for every hour of meeting,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.380]   I do 30 minutes of protected time,
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.260]   or you could go the other way.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.280]   For every hour of meetings,
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.540]   I do two hours of protected time.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.620]   It just depends on how much free time you need for your job.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.260]   The final thing I'd recommend here
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.700]   is post-meeting processing blocks.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.900]   So it's not just about, is the time,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.220]   a large block of time free?
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.380]   It's also how undistracted are you during that time?
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.940]   A big source of distraction is,
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.140]   I have this meeting till three o'clock.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.420]   I have another meeting at four,
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.220]   and I'm trying to work on a non-urgent
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.040]   but important priority in between.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.180]   A common problem is,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.140]   I go straight from that three o'clock meeting
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.340]   into that free time to try to work,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.540]   but there was a lot of things discussed in that meeting
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.760]   that need to be processed.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.620]   There's things I committed to do.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.500]   There's tasks I need to get on my task list.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.380]   There's follow-up emails I need to make,
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.500]   and that's just sitting in my head,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.740]   pulling at my attention while I'm trying to work
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.700]   in this one free hour I have
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.140]   on something that's non-urgent but important.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.180]   Even worse, let's say you stack
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.300]   three of these meetings in a row, back to back to back,
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.540]   and then you have some free time
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.540]   and you're gonna make progress on a important project there.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.260]   Well, if you stack these meetings back to back,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.620]   the commitments and information from the first meeting
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.580]   stays in your head as you move to the second meeting,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.660]   which those commitments then mix with those first ones
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.980]   as you move to the third meeting,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.160]   and now by the time you're leaving these meetings,
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.420]   your brain is calling uncle.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.900]   It's like, "Oh my God, there's all of these things
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.220]   "we're trying to keep track of.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.260]   "I'm so stressed."
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.100]   And you know what you're gonna do?
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.300]   Your brain's gonna be like, "Let's just go check email."
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.460]   So the easiest thing you can do
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.700]   to reduce the distraction impact of meetings
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.340]   is to add 10 to 15 minutes on your calendar
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.020]   to the end of every meeting.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.340]   So typically you don't need a full hour for meetings.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.220]   Just tell people let's do 45 minutes,
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.140]   make the last 15 minutes a processing block
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.380]   so you can just easily schedule the full hour.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.140]   In the last 15 minutes, that processing block,
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.340]   take care of everything you just discussed.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.180]   Any follow-up messaging you need to do, do it right then.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.560]   Any tasks that need to get scheduled,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.260]   put them into your task system.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260]   Any new deadlines this has generated,
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.440]   put them on your calendar.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.540]   You wanna close every open loop spawned by that meeting
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.760]   before that scheduled time is done.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.980]   This greatly reduces the distraction impact
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.180]   of these meetings and allows you
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.220]   to make better use of the time that remains.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.060]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.980]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.020]   that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.220]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.020]   "Slow Productivity,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.900]   "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.600]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.340]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.340]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.380]   I know you're gonna like it.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.400]   Check it out.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.480]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.840]   All right, time destroyer number three,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.320]   hive mind collaboration.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.520]   So one of the biggest generators of non-focus,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.920]   so one of the biggest generators of distraction
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.940]   is the need to keep checking in on ongoing conversations.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   That I have five different collaborative projects underway
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.120]   where we're trying to figure things out.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.420]   It's relatively time-sensitive,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.620]   and we're figuring this out
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.180]   with back-and-forth email messages
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.620]   or back-and-forth Slack messages.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.020]   Once I have an ongoing time-sensitive
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.960]   back-and-forth digital message exchange,
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.800]   I now have to check those channels all the time
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.920]   because I need to see your next message in time
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.760]   to respond to it.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.580]   So you can respond to that,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.420]   and I can respond to that,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.160]   and we can finish this issue before the day is over.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.440]   And now you've destroyed your ability
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.100]   to make work on important things
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.440]   because every time you have to check
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.160]   that chat channel or inbox,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.780]   you're inducing a context shift.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.960]   You're seeing distractions
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.640]   that are unrelated to what you're working on.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.680]   Your brain is going to go in 10 or 15 different directions.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.480]   It's gonna run out of steam quickly.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.320]   All right, so we can reduce some of this
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.800]   with our first idea,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.240]   which was reduce the number of things you're working on.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.160]   So there's just less of these less things
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.000]   generating email, sure.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.180]   We can protect time like we just talked about.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.880]   But three, for the things that remain,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.400]   the work that we are doing,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.860]   it is ongoing, it is an active project.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.780]   Find better ways to collaborate
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.480]   that don't require unscheduled messages
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.820]   that you have to read and respond to quickly.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.960]   You have to think about unscheduled messages
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.520]   that require responses as a productivity poison.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.940]   It's the same as someone coming in
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.380]   and making you take a shot of whiskey
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.660]   in terms of what is the impact going to be over time
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.040]   on your ability to actually concentrate
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.680]   and do good work.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.560]   You really have to think about it that way.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.280]   All right, so how do we get rid of
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.240]   unscheduled messages that require urgent responses
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.840]   for the products that we have to work on?
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.680]   Well, here's a few ideas.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.200]   Number one, I talk about this all the time.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.720]   You need office hours, you need regular time most days.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.880]   Your phone is on, you have a Zoom room open,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.920]   your office door is open.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.040]   Anything that requires a moderate amount of back and forth,
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.020]   something that's gonna generate like four messages
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.640]   that you're gonna have to exchange back and forth that day.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.320]   Just tell the person,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.720]   grab me whenever it's convenient at my next office hours,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.420]   I'm here and we'll figure it out, right?
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.920]   This is not about reducing the total amount of time
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.000]   you spend talking about things, right?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   'Cause you have a whole hour,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.640]   let's say put aside for office hours
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.800]   and you have, let's say four conversations
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.480]   that are tackled in those office hours,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.040]   the total amount of time it would have taken
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.720]   to maybe send emails back and forth for those four things
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.560]   might be like 10 minutes,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.160]   but now you're putting aside a full hour,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.020]   but that trade-off is absolutely worth it
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.200]   because the cost is not how long does it take you
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.820]   to write the four email messages that was required
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.440]   to coordinate this without office hours,
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.200]   the real cost is the context shifts required
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.080]   surrounding those emails.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.040]   The 25 times you had to check your inbox
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.280]   waiting for the message to come back.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.760]   The 20 minutes it takes to get your concentration back
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.640]   after each of those checks.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.480]   This adds up for much, much more time
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.960]   than just having a concentrated hour
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.320]   where you take care of a lot of back and forth all at once.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.840]   If you work in a team, have docket clearing meetings,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.240]   two or three times a week, 30 to 45 minutes,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.560]   the whole team comes together.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.140]   You say, we have this shared document,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.680]   which since the last meeting,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.280]   when anything came up that was relevant to this team,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.840]   questions, who's working on this?
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.000]   Oh my God, I'm worried about this.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.080]   Hey, a client wrote about this, what are we gonna do?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.640]   You add it to the shared document that I call a docket.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.080]   At the docket clearing meeting, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.880]   you just go through this document, everything.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.600]   Can we handle it right now?
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.560]   Let's do it.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.400]   Can we ignore this?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.220]   Let's ignore this.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.080]   Does someone need to take this?
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.560]   All right, put it on your task list right now, done.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.280]   You go through until that docket is clear
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.680]   and then the meeting's over.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.520]   This is not a generic standing meeting.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   This is not a generic check-in meeting.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.820]   This is not of like, hey, how's everyone's kids doing?
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.000]   Let's like drink some coffee.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.480]   It's, let's clear this docket as fast as possible.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.320]   This now allows you, everything that you put
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.080]   under that docket and handle in a docket clearing meeting
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.920]   would have otherwise generated a non-trivial number
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.640]   of these unscheduled back and forth messages
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.520]   that require responses.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.200]   So again, we're squashing that productivity poison.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.920]   Finally, this is an idea that goes all the way back
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.320]   to my book, "Deep Work," process-centric emailing, right?
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.880]   When you have something you need to do with someone else,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.520]   you need something from someone else.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.680]   The temptation in the moment is what's the quickest thing
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.440]   I can do right now to get this off my plate?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.080]   And that's typically writing like a pretty vague,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   fast email that yes, in the moment,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.680]   temporarily takes that off your plate
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.280]   but does not solve the problem.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.800]   Like there's a report that you need to submit to a client.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.200]   You're gonna need to get some feedback from someone else.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.880]   In the moment, you're like, I just wanna,
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.840]   I have so many things I'm doing.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.980]   I wanna get this off my plate.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.220]   You might just be like, hey, can you help give me feedback
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.060]   on this send?
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.820]   Well, there's a lot more emails to come, right?
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.520]   And they'll be like, well, yeah, what do you need?
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.640]   And you're like, okay, well, what do you think about this?
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.520]   And they won't write back.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.880]   I'm like, hey, what's going on with this?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.840]   And they're like, here's some thoughts.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.040]   Like, what about over here?
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.440]   We're now like 10 or 15 emails back and forth,
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.920]   but this thing has to go out by Friday and it's Monday.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.240]   So you're gonna have to like check your inbox
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.160]   pretty furiously to make sure it gets done.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.200]   The alternative is process-centric emailing.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.120]   Take a beat and say, I'm gonna figure out
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.760]   how we should collaborate on this.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.540]   And I am gonna describe in my initial email to you,
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.800]   this is how we are gonna collaborate on this.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.960]   And it's gonna be a process that I'm gonna design
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.060]   to try to minimize unscheduled messages.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.760]   Takes more time to write and send that message,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.520]   but you might save yourself 50 to 60 inbox checks
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.640]   down the line because of it,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.240]   which is a huge cognitive burden.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.640]   So like, let's go back to this report example.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.160]   A process-centric email might be like,
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.240]   okay, here's what's going on.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.000]   There's this report, I gotta get to the client,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.600]   I gotta get to it by Friday.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.360]   There's these sections that I don't know all the details,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.320]   so I'm gonna need your help on this.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.440]   Here's what we're gonna do.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.620]   I'm gonna write a draft of this report,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.880]   and I will email you this draft report
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.920]   by Tuesday close of business.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.800]   I have time on my calendar when I'm gonna write it.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.080]   You don't need to reply to the email.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.680]   You just have it by Tuesday close of business.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.800]   Go through and here are the type of edits I'm looking for,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.920]   X, Y, and Z, okay?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.720]   For this type of edit, here's what I need from you,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.760]   the replacement numbers.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.280]   For this type of edit, what I need from you
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.160]   is like a definitive word, don't cut this,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.800]   don't put this in, and finally, I need whatever.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.760]   If I'm missing a key point that you know about,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.660]   I need you to just add that text directly to the document.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.320]   Work on this Wednesday, work on this Thursday.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.240]   I'm gonna assume whatever version of this document
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.100]   is put in the shared folder,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.020]   I'm gonna grab that at the close of business Thursday,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.800]   and I'm gonna do my final edit.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.860]   I'll polish and submit, okay?
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.700]   That's the plan.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.740]   I think this will work well.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.280]   I've spelled this out step-by-step with bold headers.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.840]   If there's anything like,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.500]   if there's something about this not gonna work or whatever,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.140]   just give me a call, boom, sent.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.260]   So now you have specified a process
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.900]   by which you're gonna get the information you need,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.700]   the coordination of like when this is ready,
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.960]   when people are gonna get it,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.980]   this is all just worked out with timelines and schedules,
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.420]   so there's no actual messaging that has to be done,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.300]   and you're now gonna get from here to that report
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.420]   being submitted without having to receive a single message.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.580]   This process is now gonna generate zero inbox checks,
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.540]   except for you're sending the file
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.240]   to the other person in this case.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.260]   That's process-centric emailing.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.100]   And the key is make it easier to just run with the project
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.840]   than it is for them to change it.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.700]   So that's why you give a higher friction release valve.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.140]   Like, well, you can call me.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.900]   You can call me or call me during these times
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.740]   if you need to change things.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.880]   And most people will be like, oh, no, okay, shoot.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.720]   What do I have to do?
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.660]   All right, fine, let me just do that.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.460]   Right, process-centric emailing.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.520]   Again, we often count the wrong things.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.580]   We count the time required to write that message
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.740]   and say, I don't wanna spend that time,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.780]   but we don't count the massive cost
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.540]   of having to check our inbox 15 times
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.140]   for an ongoing conversation that will happen
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.180]   if we don't write that message.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.780]   So we have to think about unscheduled messages
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.040]   that require responses as a productivity poison.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.780]   All right, so here's how you get your time back.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.060]   Let's just summarize these real quick.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.480]   A, you gotta minimize overhead tax.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.080]   If your overhead tax crosses an excessive threshold,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.160]   your ability to do anything but react
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.460]   and be stressed is impossible.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.080]   This is a critical, critical threshold.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   So you have to reduce what you're working on,
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.600]   consolidate what you're working on
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.280]   to keep that tax under the threshold.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.140]   Two, you have to defragment your schedule.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.080]   If your schedule is too fragmented,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.240]   you just don't have enough undistracted time
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.520]   to actually make progress on what matters.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.960]   So you have to start protecting time.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.440]   And we talked about a lot of different strategies
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   for doing that.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.780]   And you gotta clean up time
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.960]   by doing things like post-meeting processing.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.520]   And finally, you have to resist
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.060]   the hyperactive hivemind style of collaboration.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.200]   Ad hoc, back and forth, unscheduled messaging
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.760]   is a terrible way to coordinate or collaborate.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.740]   You want to avoid that like poison.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.240]   So office hours, doc clearing, process-centric emails.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.440]   You should be willing to do almost anything.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.120]   You don't have to walk across fire and fight an alligator.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.900]   If that's what I have to do to prevent this
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.160]   from having to just be emails back and forth all day,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.000]   you should seriously consider doing that.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.760]   That's how much you should fear
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.440]   having to have unscheduled emails
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.920]   be something that you have to deal with all day long.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.680]   All right, so that's how you find time, right?
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.920]   It's not always a dramatic change
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.680]   has to happen to your circumstances.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.780]   Your same job with your same responsibilities
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.460]   can have a vastly different subjective impact
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.560]   on your sense of free time
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.520]   to make progress on non-urgent things,
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.640]   depending on how you approach it.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.120]   Work on those three time destroyers,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.560]   and that schedule is going to feel way more expansive.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.320]   There we go, time destroyers, Jesse.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.720]   - You're big into schedule fragmentation
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.520]   in terms of dedicating writing time in the mornings, right?
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.360]   - Yeah, that's a big thing I do
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.880]   is I protect writing time in the morning.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.000]   I just don't do things in the morning.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.280]   And then once you have a rule, it's pretty simple.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.000]   Now here's the thing.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.960]   We imagine, like when it comes to things
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.040]   like constraints on when we schedule meetings,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.180]   we imagine two things that are false.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.880]   First, people like to imagine the scenario
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.280]   in which everyone else says yes to every suggestion.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.480]   That everyone else you work with,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   when the boss says,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.840]   "Hey, can you meet on Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon?"
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.160]   They always say yes.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.280]   And that you're this huge outlier because you say,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.720]   "Well, that time doesn't work, but how about these times?"
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.320]   Here's the reality.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.360]   People say no all the time.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.040]   They have busy schedules, right?
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.320]   Finding a meeting time
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.760]   often requires several different options.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   So it is not unusual or noteworthy that you're saying,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.800]   "Well, that time doesn't work, but these times do."
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.060]   It doesn't seem obstinate.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.320]   It doesn't seem like you're non-available.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.440]   No one's noticing.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   All right, two, the other scenario
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.640]   that people invent in their mind
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.160]   is that the various people
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.920]   who are trying to schedule things on your calendar
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.760]   throughout the week, like,
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.560]   "Hey, can we meet? Can we jump on a call?"
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.360]   All get together.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.760]   And they have a big whiteboard with a picture of you on it.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   And there's yarn going from it to other things.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.260]   And they're tracking really carefully,
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.520]   like when did you get a no from Cal?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.360]   What about you?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.560]   And they're staring at this and they're smoking pipes.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.400]   And they're like,
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.600]   "I think he's doing meetings in the morning."
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.620]   And then one of the people stands up and says,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.200]   "How dare he?"
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.920]   And then like another person in the corner
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.600]   sort of like Quint from "Jaws"
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.640]   when he's sitting in the corner says,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   "I say we go get 'em."
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.000]   And then they're all gonna come and get you.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.920]   That no one is tracking, no one knows.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.000]   They're like, they're all day long.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.480]   There's meetings and yes, no,
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.420]   and trying to make things work.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.500]   They don't know.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.480]   They don't see the patterns in your nose.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.340]   They don't care about how you organize yourself.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.920]   Now, the flip side of this is don't tell people.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.600]   No one, no one cares.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.760]   Don't make them care.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.460]   Don't, oh, for God, God forbid,
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.760]   don't write a Tim Ferriss autoresponder.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   Don't try to explain your scheduling philosophy
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.200]   to everyone that comes through.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.660]   Don't preemptively defensively be like,
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.280]   "I don't meet on mornings and here's why,
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.600]   "because you bastards are taking up all my time."
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.120]   Then you're giving someone something to react to.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.320]   Don't explain it, just do it.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.000]   No one's paying attention to you.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.320]   As long as you're offering plenty of times to have meetings,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.280]   they don't, they're not gonna notice patterns
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.880]   about the times that you say no.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.320]   All right, well, we got some good questions
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.200]   about this type of stuff,
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.640]   but first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.000]   This message is sponsored by Greenlight.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.880]   Look, as your kids get older,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.360]   some things about parenting gets easier.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.240]   I now have two out of my three kids
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.000]   who can just put themselves to bed.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.920]   They can brush their teeth.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.120]   They can floss.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.200]   They can bathe themselves.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.520]   I spent like the last decade brushing kids' teeth,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.000]   and I'm only down to one that I need to do this.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.840]   So that's great.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.860]   Some things get easier.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.080]   Other things, unfortunately,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.440]   don't, like having conversations about money.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.560]   The fact is kids won't really know how to manage their money
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.700]   until they're actually in charge of it.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.920]   This is where Greenlight can help.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.600]   Greenlight is a debit card and money app made for families.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.200]   Parents can send money to their kids
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.760]   and keep an eye on kids' spending and saving,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.860]   while kids and teens build money confidence
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.040]   and lifelong literacy skills.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.840]   With the Greenlight app,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.020]   your kids can learn how to save,
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.580]   how to invest, and how to spend wisely.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.340]   Even have games that can teach money skills
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.220]   in a fun and accessible way.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.580]   They just added a chores feature
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.820]   that you can set up with one-timer recurring chores
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.380]   customized to your family's need
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.100]   and reward kids with an allowance for a job well done.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.900]   We use Greenlight.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.980]   So my 11-year-old soon to turn 12
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.560]   and my nine-year-old have,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.780]   they use Greenlight.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.640]   We use the app with them.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.920]   They have a Greenlight debit card.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.340]   My six-year-old does not.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.240]   It's been fantastic.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.840]   Because now instead of just us spending on their behalf
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.960]   and be like, this is coming out
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   of some metaphorical allowance,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.120]   they have an account.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.260]   They can ask us how much money do I have right now
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.000]   in my Greenlight setup.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.240]   More importantly,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.000]   they can go and use their Greenlight card.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.320]   So let me give you a very concrete scenario.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.600]   Yesterday, one of my kids was home sick
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.360]   and I'm putting furious quotation marks
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.120]   because it became clear like 30 minutes into the morning,
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.380]   he wasn't really that sick, right?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.940]   So he was bored,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.380]   but he also wanted to buy Magic the Gathering card.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.980]   So we began, my wife and I began giving him chores, right?
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.060]   He cleaned out our car.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.860]   He reorganized the bookshelves
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.340]   and we added money to his Greenlight setup
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.700]   for the chores he did.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.580]   And then at the end of the day,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.000]   him and his brothers walked to the toy store in town
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.840]   here in Tacoma Park
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.820]   and they used their card on their own
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.900]   and they bought Magic cards or whatever.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.740]   So it's great.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.620]   Like they can see how much money they have.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.040]   They can go to stores on their own
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.140]   and spend it so that it's tangible to them.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.420]   They see the amount go down after,
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.300]   they have more of an appreciation for money.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.980]   Anyways, I'm a big Greenlight fan
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.300]   and I'm not the only one.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.700]   Millions of parents and kids
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.220]   are learning about money on Greenlight.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.180]   It's the easy, convenient way for parents
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.960]   to raise financially smart kids and families
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.160]   to navigate life together.

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.840]   greenlight.com/deep.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:50.780]   Also wanna talk about our longtime friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.220]   Going online without ExpressVPN
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.140]   is like forgetting to mute yourself on a Zoom meeting.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.420]   Do you really want your coworkers
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.460]   to hear all the trash talk that you're doing
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.700]   about the backgrounds behind them?
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.460]   Or like here you go in and go into the bathroom
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.300]   while you're on the call?
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.380]   Oh, so you gotta mute it.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.980]   But going on the internet without a VPN,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.700]   it's kind of the same thing.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.860]   You're exposing a lot of yourself to the world.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.740]   Here's how it works.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.940]   With a VPN, instead of having your traffic
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.200]   just go into the world where people can see it,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.900]   people can sniff your packets out of the air
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   if you're wireless or your internet service provider
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.740]   can see what you're connecting to if you're private.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.220]   With a VPN, you say, no, no, no,
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.420]   I'm going to mute my traffic by encrypting everything.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.060]   All the services and sites I'm trying to talk to,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.100]   I encrypt those messages on my computer.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.480]   I then send them to a ExpressVPN server,
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.660]   which then unencrypts them
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.320]   and talks to the site and service on your behalf,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.420]   then encrypts the response and sends it back.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.980]   So what are the people who are near you,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.540]   the people who can listen to your wireless connection
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.860]   or your internet service provider
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.580]   that all your traffic goes through?
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.600]   All they know is you're talking to a VPN server.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.300]   They have no idea what site you're talking to.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.420]   They have no idea what service you are using.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.020]   You gain back your privacy.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.700]   Now, if you're going to use a VPN,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.180]   use ExpressVPN is the one I trust.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.500]   It's easy, you can set up on any of your devices.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.580]   You just turn it on and then use all your apps
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.920]   and web browsers like normal.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.140]   It's just happening seamlessly in the background.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.620]   They have servers around the world.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.460]   So wherever you are,
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.700]   there's probably a server nearby that you can connect to.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.260]   They have a lot of throughput bandwidth.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.500]   So the connections are fast.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.740]   You don't even know that you're using it.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.660]   They're very highly rated because it works well.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.500]   All right, so you got to use a VPN.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.900]   And I suggest that you use ExpressVPN.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.860]   Again, your phone, laptop, tablet, and more.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.780]   It'll work on number one,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.060]   is rated number one by reviewers like CNET and The Verge.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.800]   So protect your online privacy today
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.660]   by visiting expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.060]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S, VPN.com/deep.

[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.020]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.320]   - First question is from the Newportian Scrum Master.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.240]   In episode 318, you discuss how knowledge workers
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.180]   should consider taking breaks during the week
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.980]   because they're paid for creating rather than cranking.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.860]   Do you have any insight on how these principles
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.820]   might apply to a Scrum Agile development team?
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.860]   In these frameworks,
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.720]   the team as a whole sets goals for the end of a sprint.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.860]   - Well, if run correctly,
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.820]   Agile should be very compatible
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.140]   with these ideas of having some variation in your day,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.580]   even being able to take a multi-hour break
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.820]   without it being a problem, right?
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.500]   The reason is when you're doing a sprint
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.220]   in an Agile methodology like Scrum,
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.060]   you're focused on one thing.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.020]   Hey, we're working on adding this feature to the software
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.160]   and that's what we're doing.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.380]   This means you don't have the seven or eight
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.220]   ongoing initiatives that are each generating
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.180]   their own hyperactive hive mind collaboration,
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.380]   which often ties people to need to be
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.540]   connected all the time.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.380]   No, no, you're just working on one thing.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.900]   So you're not tied to I need to be in like my inbox
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.700]   or chat channel all the time dealing with 10 things.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.300]   But if you're just working on one thing,
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.460]   how many hours a day can you actually
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.860]   like really be working hard on that thing?
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.040]   And it's not eight.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.620]   In my book, I think this was in my book,
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.100]   "A World Without Email",
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.060]   I talked about this methodology called extreme programming
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.260]   where you pair program,
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.020]   you sit two people at the same monitor
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.500]   and it's full out concentration.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.900]   And they can only get like five hours of work max.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.520]   And at first they talk about these organizations,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.900]   how their new employees have to go home and take a nap.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.060]   It's that mentally exhausting.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.820]   Like if you're really giving something your full insight,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.700]   it's really mentally exhausting.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.100]   So this idea that like from nine to five,
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.060]   you're sitting there locked in writing great code
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.900]   is just not realistic.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.820]   So if you're sprinting,
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.460]   so you're only working on one thing
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.540]   and this thing is hard,
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.860]   you're gonna have to take some breaks
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.900]   to titrate your concentration.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.060]   It really shouldn't matter if like two hours in here,
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.860]   you're not working on it.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.340]   Now, if your sprints are so tight
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.660]   that there's no time to do that,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.260]   then your sprints are too tight.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.060]   Like a good sprint, we're all working on this thing,
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.180]   we're working on it hard.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.340]   It's not taking up every hour of the day
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.380]   'cause that's impossible.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.000]   Then we get it done and we move on to the next thing.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.220]   So I think agile done right should be very compatible
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.620]   with some of these slow productivity ideas.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.820]   - All right, what do we got next?
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.580]   - Next question is from Joe.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.780]   I'm working on my thesis,
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.140]   holding a student job and learning the local language
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.360]   as I'm not a native.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.020]   I also have to do household tasks.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.260]   I find planning my days a major challenge.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.100]   My supervisors are scattered and so things can be unplanned.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.740]   I also find that after 6 p.m.,
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.900]   I'm usually too drained to study or focus
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.940]   on any additional tasks, including cooking dinner.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.260]   How can I better structure my days?
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.020]   - Well, Joe, you need to move your thesis work
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.860]   to first thing.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   This tends to work very well.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.820]   Do two to three hours first thing.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.980]   This might have to be early
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.780]   if you have a student job that starts
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.300]   somewhat in the morning,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.060]   but just two to three hours every day.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.900]   You want the compound interest of persistent effort
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.380]   is what you're looking for here.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.500]   You wanna avoid the typical sort of
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.740]   pre-graduate student mentality of work
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.380]   is something that happens in big inspired burst at night.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.220]   That's not gonna work.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.340]   You're not an undergraduate anymore.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.020]   So three hours, first thing in the morning,
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.380]   even if this means you have to do 6.30 to 9.30 a.m.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.340]   All right, make very persistent progress.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.660]   With your disorganized supervisor,
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.940]   have a weekly meeting set up
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.460]   and you take the reins of organizing these meetings.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.300]   You come to your advisor.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.780]   Here's what I'm working on now.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.980]   I'm gonna deliver you this draft by this meeting.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.700]   And then here's the notes I need from you
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.540]   for the next meeting.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.700]   You basically just have to organize their life for them.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.060]   This is common with academics.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.420]   Like sometimes you have to just organize their life for them
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.100]   because they themselves are too disorganized.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.380]   So you wanna take out the critical path
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.500]   just waiting for the supervisor to be more organized.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.180]   So you're working in the morning, you have your job,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.740]   then you need a really crystal clear
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.300]   schedule shutdown complete, shutdown ritual.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.460]   Work is done.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.580]   Now I'm in non-work time.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.860]   You gotta treat that psychologically very different.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.020]   I invented the shutdown ritual
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.140]   in response to working on my doctoral dissertation
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.060]   because it really has a way just being in the middle
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.700]   of such a complicated long project.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.580]   It really gets its hooks into your mind
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.140]   and all your mind wants to do is keep thinking about it.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.100]   So it's really important to have the shutdown ritual.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.700]   Now your evenings are just non-work time.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.940]   And what do you wanna do with your non-work time?
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.820]   Well, I guess you could just like sit around and do nothing.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.660]   But what you're gonna find
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.020]   is that if you've really shut down your work,
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.860]   like, I don't know,
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.620]   like I'll make an interesting dinner today
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.460]   or I'm gonna go like for a walk
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.220]   or I'm gonna like tackle this task today.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.060]   You get kind of like a clean slate
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.540]   when you psychologically transition
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.780]   from work to non-work time.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.900]   There's a classic book about this,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.380]   Arnold Bennett's "How to Live in 24 Hours a Day"
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.660]   which came out in the early 20th century.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.340]   Where he basically argues,
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.220]   you have eight hours of work,
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.260]   you have eight hours of sleep,
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.300]   treat your eight hours in between
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.540]   as like you, a different life.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.900]   Like that you're a gentleman patrician
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.940]   that just has landed, you're a landed gentry
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.700]   and you just have to, you can control
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.020]   what you wanna do with your time.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.500]   And like treat it not as recovery from work,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.220]   but as like your time to whatever, read poetry.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.380]   You know, he had pretty kind of elitist ideas
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.340]   what to do with that time.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.260]   But you treat that time,
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.260]   if you can shut down your work,
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.500]   that's like really interesting time.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.700]   You could do some chores,
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.140]   you can do some restorative stuff,
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.540]   you can do some exploration
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.820]   and really keep, I would say,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.300]   balance those two things really well in the evening.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.820]   Chores plus things that are restorative and interesting.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.980]   And that begins to like really change your sense
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.700]   of the evenings to like something again,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.740]   that's like regenerating and rejuvenating you
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.460]   and not just psychologically
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.380]   as this time to recuperate.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.500]   Because honestly, work on your dissertation,
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.060]   student job, this is not the salt mines.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.340]   It's also not, you're not like in one,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.340]   the Apollo mission trying to save Apollo 13.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.740]   Your mind will be okay.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.260]   You're not exhausted beyond all repair if you do that.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.380]   The final thing I wanna warn you against
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.500]   is do not descend down the rabbit hole
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.860]   of what I call a dissertation hell mindset.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.940]   There's a whole sort of online sub-community
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.540]   for various reasons that I have a lot of theories on
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.660]   but I don't wanna get into.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.940]   For various reasons, they want to recast the process
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.700]   of working on a doctoral dissertation
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.580]   as some sort of almost like impossibly demanding,
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.700]   traumatic, terrible experience.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.980]   And they egg each other on online
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.620]   about how terrible it is.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.700]   And this is death for motivation.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.900]   And it's also misguided.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   It's not that hard, all right?
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.700]   Trust me, there's much harder things in life.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.860]   There's much harder jobs.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.180]   So avoid the whole dissertation hell
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.980]   sort of subculture out there.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.340]   It's like, you're working on this, it's a few hours a day.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.660]   Take your time.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.220]   You don't have to finish it this month.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.700]   It's gonna take the time it's gonna take.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.740]   Compound interest of accomplishment.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.260]   Get that done first, do your job, shut it off.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.500]   Treat your evening as like a completely different life.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.140]   Balance restorative and regenerative and fun with chores.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.540]   I think you'll be fine.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.700]   I think you'll be fine.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.900]   I used to, Jesse, I used to go down that rabbit hole
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.580]   back when I was writing just for students.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.060]   And there was this really strong
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.900]   online dissertation hell community.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.620]   And there's so many weird things going on
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.900]   psychologically with these people.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.020]   I mean, they had to somehow cast this thing.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.980]   And most of these were people
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.140]   who were like full-time doctoral students
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.260]   writing a dissertation
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.660]   on like no particular deadlines or timescales.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.980]   I mean, this is like probably the easiest year
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.860]   of all their life to follow
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.980]   compared with the difficulties of like a real job,
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.420]   a family, health issues, whatever.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.380]   And it would just insistently try to recast this
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.660]   as if they just arrived at the gulag.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.060]   And like it's survival every day.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.460]   Or like they're trying to, again,
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.860]   save the Apollo 13 from,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.660]   if they don't figure out how to like
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.460]   get the carbon dioxide scrubbed,
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.260]   Jim Lovell's gonna die or whatever, right?
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.620]   I mean, it was a whole crazy subculture.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.540]   - So these had to be on blog 'cause it was-
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.380]   - It was all blogs.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.820]   So I'm assuming, I don't use social media, so I don't know.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.260]   I'm assuming if this- - It's worse.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.420]   - It's probably worse.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.780]   And it's probably on TikTok, which is probably worse.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.620]   But yeah, back then it was blogs.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.780]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.700]   Next question's from Rafael.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.460]   "I have two questions about the calendar.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.020]   First, what is the best frequency to check it?
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.140]   And second, what is the best tool to do it?
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   Desktop screen, phone, or print it out?"
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.100]   - I mean, use an electronic calendar.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.540]   When you check it, you just look at it.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.740]   Like there's nothing tricky here.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.500]   Tool's not gonna help.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.980]   You're checking your calendar.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.380]   There's two major occasions
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.060]   on which you're checking your calendar.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.340]   The first and most frequent
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.540]   is when you're building your daily plan.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.860]   So if you subscribe to multi-scale planning,
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.420]   you are every day, you're building a plan for your day.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.100]   I suggest doing time block planning
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.260]   where you're actually giving every minute of your day a job
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.820]   as opposed to going through your day in a reactive methods.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.540]   Hey, what's next or what do I wanna work on next?
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.460]   I keep my daily time block plan on paper.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.300]   I mean, I sell my own time block planner.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.140]   I use that.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.980]   I have boxes full of them, okay?
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.060]   But you can do it on whatever format you wanna use it on.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.020]   So when you create your daily time block plan,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.580]   you are transferring things on your calendar
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.420]   onto that plan.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.620]   So any meetings or appointments that are on your calendar,
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.180]   you are drawing physically onto your time block plan
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.020]   and then you're blocking all the remaining time as well.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.140]   So you're checking your calendar when you do that.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.740]   Also, when you're doing your daily plan,
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.780]   the other thing you're gonna check for on your calendar
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.460]   is deadlines.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.700]   I'm often a heavy user.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.620]   I use Google Calendar of making use of all day events,
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.300]   which just show up at the top of your day,
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.260]   not as like on a particular time.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.740]   I use those for deadlines and reminders.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.980]   Hey, deadline for getting this done today.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.620]   I have like a book quote due today.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.380]   Make sure the deadline for filing
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.020]   the reimbursement forms is today.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.900]   So when I'm building my daily time block plan,
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.500]   I see those deadlines on my calendar.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.660]   So I make sure in my daily time block plan,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.980]   I've blocked off time to deal with them.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.460]   I don't need to see my calendar again
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.460]   for the rest of that day
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.420]   'cause I now run my day off of the daily time block plan.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.340]   The exception, of course, if during the course of your day,
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.820]   let's say you have a block, you're checking your email
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.300]   and you're trying to set up a meeting with someone,
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.420]   well, yeah, then you'll go to your calendar
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.220]   to find what time's available.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.460]   But I transfer from my calendar
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.700]   to my daily time block plan, I run my day off of that.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.940]   The other context in which you're gonna check your calendar
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.740]   is every week.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.020]   When you make your weekly plan,
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.860]   you look at your calendar for the whole week
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.220]   to get a sense of what time is free.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.740]   During your weekly plan, one of your primary goals
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.180]   is to try to put aside time on your calendar
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.740]   for important initiatives that aren't already on there.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.460]   So you're like, okay, I really wanna make progress
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.820]   this week on my book.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.300]   Where do I have free time to work on my book?
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.140]   Why don't I protect that now on my calendar
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.340]   by putting pre-scheduled appointments to work on my book?
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.100]   Now that time is protected, and when I get to those days
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.380]   and build my daily time block plan,
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.900]   I'll see them and integrate them automatically.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.220]   During your weekly plan, you'll probably be frustrated
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.540]   that your schedule's too fragmented,
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.180]   so it's also a good time to try to defragment your schedule.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.060]   So as you look at your calendar for the week ahead,
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.060]   you might be like, you know what?
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.260]   Thursday morning is great.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.540]   I don't have stuff until noon,
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.220]   and it would be a great time to tackle
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.260]   this big important project, except I have this coffee
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.060]   out of office across town at 10 a.m.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.700]   That one thing is making Thursday morning unusable.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.540]   I'm just gonna move that coffee.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.820]   I'm gonna move that coffee to drinks
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.420]   because now I've unlocked four consecutive hours,
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.740]   and I can get this important thing
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.300]   that's in my strategic plan, get this done, right?
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.780]   Or you say, I got these three meetings.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.740]   I could probably consolidate those
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.300]   because it's the same people.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.860]   We set them up at different times,
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.140]   but it's the same people, and it's eating up this afternoon.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.580]   Why don't I just tell the people,
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.660]   let's just make the first meeting a little bit longer,
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.580]   and that's gonna free up a two-hour block there.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.860]   I kinda need that because I wanna fit
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.900]   this other thing in there.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.260]   So your weekly plan,
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.700]   you're not only surveying your calendar,
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.220]   but now you're kinda playing with it a little bit,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.060]   trying to make it better.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.060]   So you're definitely gonna see your calendar
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.140]   at your weekly plan.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.340]   You're gonna see your calendar every day
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.420]   when you build your daily plan,
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.260]   and you'll see your calendar
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.180]   when you're trying to schedule things, all right?
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.940]   In terms of checking it, how you check it,
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.780]   there's no magic here.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.380]   It's a Google calendar, you look at it.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.780]   Yeah, that's not a big deal.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.020]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.980]   - Next question's from Bob.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.180]   I'm motivated by your monthly book updates to read more.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.780]   I have multiple jobs and sometimes
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.340]   just don't have hardly any free time in a given day.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.180]   On these days, is reading for 20 to 30 minutes
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.980]   actually do anything?
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.500]   - Well, I mean, first I'll say reading is good.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.020]   So read, have a reading habit.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.220]   That's what's important.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.780]   What that actually means in terms of number of pages read
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.900]   or number of books finished,
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.100]   that depends on a lot of things.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.980]   That depends, for example, on how much free time you have.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.860]   It also depends on what you're reading, right?
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.860]   Like I read at a much slower rate
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.220]   than like the typical sort of book club reader
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.940]   that reads primarily like what is the,
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.180]   this is like a major driver of books in this country.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.980]   Like what novel is like making waves
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.300]   and being recommended as a good novel, right?
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.660]   So like what I call book club readers,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.140]   it's like everyone in all the book clubs in the country
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:35.580]   are all gonna read "The Vaster Wilds"
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.420]   because it's been told this is a good book.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.740]   Like fiction is often much faster.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.820]   And you could go through a lot of those books.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.540]   I read a lot of nonfiction.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.900]   This is slower.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.380]   I'm reading a book right now on settler colonialism.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.500]   This goes slower than reading like the,
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.780]   I don't actually know these,
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.740]   the Emil Henry, Emily Henry book or whatever, right?
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.420]   So don't get too caught up in the number of books.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.660]   Get caught up in, am I a reader or am I not?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.180]   That being said, here's what I wanna say.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.420]   Like I'm a busy, I'm busy, right?
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.060]   I have a few jobs, have a bunch of kids, et cetera.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.180]   A lot of volunteer positions.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.180]   I do a lot of stuff.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.580]   I read five books a month, right?
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.060]   I don't think much about it.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.740]   I'm not doing heroic or exceptional efforts
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.100]   to find time to read those books.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.260]   What are the two things that seem to matter the most
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   for reading quantity for me?
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.300]   Pick books in the moment I'm super psyched about.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.860]   I have a very eclectic reading list.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.500]   You hear it every month on the show.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.140]   It's because in the moment I say, this is a book,
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.820]   right now I'm like excited about this idea.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.900]   So I wanna read this right now.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.980]   I wanna know more about this.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.900]   I'm jazzed about, I'm gonna read this.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.620]   When you're excited about a book, you read it more.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.460]   And this is different again,
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.100]   I think than like the book club model,
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:52.220]   which is everyone says this is the new good novel.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.060]   So we all have to read this now.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.220]   Like that's a different,
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.740]   that's a fine relationship with books,
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.140]   but it's different than the way I do it.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.780]   I read primarily non-fiction
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.420]   and it's because I'm interested in this idea right now.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.940]   Oh, wouldn't it be cool to know more about it?
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.220]   It's relevant to the things I'm working on.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.940]   I'm excited about the book, okay?
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.820]   Two, I don't use social media, right?
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.940]   I know that sounds like it really shouldn't be related,
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.540]   but people vastly underestimate the amount of time
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.820]   that is free that gets devoured
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.460]   trying to help the valuation
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.380]   of Mark Zuckerberg's stock holdings.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.340]   People underestimate how much time gets eaten up by that.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.980]   When your default for boredom is like,
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.820]   let me see what's on the screen and it's hyper palatable,
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.500]   that eats up all the book time.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.700]   I don't entertain myself that much on my phone.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.700]   I mean, I punish myself with my phone,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.780]   at least in recent days,
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.300]   because I follow the Washington Nationals
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.580]   losing four games in a row.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.340]   And it makes me wanna throw my phone out a window.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.060]   I don't know why I punish myself that way.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.660]   All right, guys hit a ball.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.020]   But I don't have social media on there.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.740]   I don't watch YouTube on my phone, right?
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.380]   So my phone is pretty boring.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.140]   You have more time than you think then.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.340]   Like, I'm just gonna read a little bit
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.380]   while I wait for my wife to get ready.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.220]   We're gonna go out.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.220]   There's like 20 minutes.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.780]   I'm just gonna like read a little bit.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.900]   That adds up.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.740]   At night, it adds up.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.180]   If you're looking at your phone at night,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.900]   that's like two books a month right there.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.340]   So read stuff that you're psyched about,
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.780]   not that like people say you're supposed to read
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.700]   and don't use your phone for entertainment.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.580]   Like, you'd be surprised.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.660]   You might get a lot more reading out of your time.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.500]   It's true.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.340]   The only thing I do
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.380]   in terms of like thinking about my five books a month
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.660]   is I don't like to finish too fast.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.220]   Like if I'm kind of done early,
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.660]   I'll slow down or maybe switch to a bigger book to slow down.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   Like the only thing I do is actually slow myself down.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.620]   'Cause sometimes in the summer,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.620]   I'll read six or seven books,
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.140]   but I don't wanna kind of get in the habit of that
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.340]   because I worry that I'm just gonna raise
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.940]   like my expectations for how much I'll read.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.780]   So I'll slow myself down,
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.180]   but I really don't think a lot about,
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.740]   I just kind of get there.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.340]   - I guess a lot of the books go by pretty quickly too
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.660]   for instance, that atomic, the nuclear war book,
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.500]   that's--
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.340]   - That's a fast book.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.220]   - It seems like-- - Did you read it?
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.220]   - I'm in the process.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.140]   - It's fast to read, isn't it?
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.500]   - Yeah. - I read that in one day.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.940]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.500]   Yeah, so some of these books do go fast.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.820]   Some of the more intellectual ones go slow.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.300]   We'll talk about it in whenever we do the next book update,
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.060]   but there was a, I've been working on this for six months,
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.060]   a 600 page, no, it's 550 page ethics book.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.460]   And it's just like--
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.420]   - Ethics as in?
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.500]   - Just like literally, I'll get into it later.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.420]   But anyways, this was all like read 10 pages a night
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.100]   six months later, like as a meditative act.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.700]   And like six months later, I was done with that.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.500]   So some of these books go a little bit,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.580]   go a little bit slower, but--
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.380]   - Neil Stevenson fiction books, those take me a while.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.220]   - Yeah, they're fast.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.420]   The pages read fast,
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.340]   but there's so many damn pages in the book.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.780]   Just not, that guy likes to write.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.100]   Man, he gets into them.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:00.860]   Yeah, those take a while.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.700]   All right, let's see here.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.260]   What do we got next?
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.700]   - Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.820]   - Ooh, all right, everyone.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.620]   Slow Productivity Corner is where we have
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.500]   one question per week based on ideas for my new book,
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.220]   "Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.340]   "Without Burnout."
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.940]   Mainly, this is just an excuse for us to play
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.380]   our much loved Slow Productivity Corner theme music.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.940]   Let's hear that music now, Jesse.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.340]   (slow music)
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:31.580]   All right, who do we have today?
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   I gotta talk in my slow productivity voice
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.060]   after the theme music.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.740]   Who do we have today, Jesse?
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.860]   - Hi, questions from Krishna.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.140]   As a creative, I really embrace the principle
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.740]   of working at a natural pace from slow productivity,
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.580]   but I'm afraid that's keeping me from pushing
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.540]   a little harder on getting things done.
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:51.540]   How can I find the uncomfortable but not drained out spot?
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.220]   - All right, well, Krishna, you gotta keep reading, right?
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.260]   Because what are the three principles in slow productivity
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.780]   and what's the order in which they're presented?
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.060]   Principle number one, do fewer things.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   Okay, so yeah, this is about reducing overhead tax,
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.020]   less concurrent projects means less distraction.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.180]   You can do more quality work.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.620]   What's principle number two in the book?
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.460]   Work at a natural pace, which you mentioned here.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.060]   Like, okay, stretch out how long your expectations
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.740]   for how long things take.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.180]   Be comfortable with variations in intensity
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.460]   on different time scales.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.140]   Busy days, less busy days.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.260]   Busy seasons versus less busy seasons.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.780]   Kind of slow down, give things the time they require.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.220]   Don't try to be pegged at 10, eight hours a day,
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.780]   you know, five days a week.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:39.300]   If you stop there, as you note here,
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.140]   you could feel like you are actually gonna be
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   reducing your production.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.660]   Like, if you stop here,
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.420]   the relationship you're gonna develop with work
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.660]   feels sort of antagonistic.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.660]   It's something to reduce, it's something to slow down.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:01.420]   You'll be focused on the negative aspects of work.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.100]   Now, you need to do these things
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.220]   'cause otherwise you're gonna burn out.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.820]   But if you stop there, you're gonna grow
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.100]   to have this antagonistic relationship with work,
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.260]   which you're very, I think, sagely concerned about
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.660]   in this question.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.740]   And where does this end?
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.940]   Well, you're gonna end up like one of these substackers
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.660]   who, after a while, you're just convinced
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.820]   that like any boss in the world is, you know,
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.100]   secretly some sort of like Orwellian Hitler
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.900]   and we all have to just fume
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.060]   until we can overthrow capitalism.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.420]   You don't end up in good places.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.140]   So if you keep reading,
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.620]   you get to the solution to this problem,
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.220]   which is principle number three,
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.140]   which is obsess over quality.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.140]   And I say in the book,
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.180]   this principle, obsess over quality,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.300]   is what makes the other two work.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.380]   It's what prevents you from falling
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.140]   into a dead-end psychological cul-de-sac of bitterness.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.180]   It's what prevents you from seeing work
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.540]   as this sort of amorphous antagonistic force
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.660]   against which you're constantly fighting.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.180]   It's also what's gonna make you much more successful
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.380]   at implementing the ideas from the first two.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.020]   So when you obsess over quality,
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.580]   the busyness that you're reducing with principle one
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.180]   self-evidently needs to be reduced
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.780]   because it's getting in the way of you killing it.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.380]   You have like this awesome stuff you're trying to produce,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.900]   the busyness is getting in your way.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.420]   I'm reducing busyness so I can be better.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.020]   That's different than I'm reducing busyness
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.940]   because my boss is an Aurelian Hitler.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.220]   Principle number two, okay, working at a natural pace.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.820]   When you're obsessing over quality,
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.140]   that becomes self-evident.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.140]   You say, yeah, what matters is
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.300]   I'm trying to produce something awesome.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.100]   I need to give that the time it deserves.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.300]   And it doesn't matter if I'm super busy eight hours a day,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.100]   performing busyness is unrelated
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.260]   to whether I really do this thing really well
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.220]   and I need to be sustainable in my efforts here
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.380]   because it's gonna be a long haul
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.780]   to really become a master of what I'm doing.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.660]   So yeah, of course, I'm gonna kind of take breaks,
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.020]   become self-evident.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.220]   You're working at a natural pace,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.300]   not because there's a mustache twisting
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.500]   sort of like Henry Ford character that's like forcing you
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.740]   and you're trying to fight back against it,
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.460]   but because this is gonna make it easier for you
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.260]   over time to produce stuff you really care about.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.340]   And finally, when you obsess over quality,
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.820]   your work becomes more meaningful.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.820]   Humans love mastery.
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.860]   It's one of the key components
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.860]   of Ryan and Decky's self-determination theory.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.340]   Humans need mastery.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.820]   It makes humans motivated.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.100]   It makes humans happier.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.860]   So your work itself is gonna become more meaningful.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.140]   At the same time,
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.900]   as you produce things that are better and better,
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.780]   you gain more autonomy over your career,
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.500]   which means it's easier to work on fewer things
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.740]   'cause you have leverage.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:39.060]   It's easier to work at a natural pace,
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.220]   to have busy seasons, less busy seasons,
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.260]   because you're really good at what you do
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.100]   and you have leverage.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.740]   So it's the engine, it's the glue,
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.860]   it's the connecting fibers to the slow productivity mindset,
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.900]   what makes it sustainable, what makes it possible,
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.100]   what makes it actually succeed over time
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.300]   is if you obsess over the quality of what you do best.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.420]   So if you get to that chapter,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.860]   I think your concern about like,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.780]   am I just taking my foot off the accelerator?
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.260]   Is this gonna make me like worse at my job?
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.340]   Those concerns should vanish.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.220]   I thought about putting that principle first
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.380]   because it's so important,
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.500]   but I really, I think I needed to get at the things,
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.340]   I need to get at the slowing down ideas first
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.980]   before getting to like the do this sustainably
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.260]   and the succeed in doing these ideas,
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   you need to do this other piece.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.380]   I think if I started with the obsess over quality,
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.220]   it would take too long
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.900]   before we got to the actual slowing down.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.940]   But the flip side of that is you really gotta make it
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.500]   through the whole book before the whole thing makes sense.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.340]   So once you get the principle three,
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.840]   principles one and two become much more effective.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.620]   I think that deserves, Jesse,
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.860]   hearing the theme music one more time.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:50.460]   - All right, do we have a call this week?
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.300]   - Yes, we do.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.120]   - All right.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.700]   - Hi, Cal, this is Emily from Seattle.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.820]   I'm a big fan of your work.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.500]   Thanks for everything that you do.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.220]   I'm curious your perspective on different types of deep work
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.980]   in the same day or in the same week.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.980]   So in my situation during the day,
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.780]   I'm an organization development and change consultant.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.420]   So I'm dealing with leaders and teams
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.820]   in some kind of large-scale change.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.420]   And there's a good amount of deep work with that,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.020]   whether it's sort of dealing with conflict
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.860]   or some kind of really intense situation,
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.540]   or whether it's just thinking really hard
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.740]   about what the next step in the plan is.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.580]   And then in the evening, I write and play music,
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.160]   and that's a really important part of my life as well.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.060]   And in my experience, some days I'm able to do
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.820]   a really nice shutdown routine from my day job
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.020]   and maybe eat something or do a little bit of exercise
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.740]   and then get straight into the creative work,
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.980]   and I can do a good amount of deep work there as well.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.640]   But other days, I just feel like I've done so much
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.460]   of my day job, by the time I'm finished
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.220]   and do a shutdown routine, I'm just exhausted,
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.300]   and I don't have any capacity for that music.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.140]   And I try to balance it and kind of give myself
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.380]   permission and space to take a break if I need it.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.360]   But I'm curious your perspective on our capacity,
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.220]   I guess, as humans to manage certain amounts of deep work,
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.620]   and because they're very different types of deep work,
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.780]   if you have any tips or things that might help me
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.580]   to make time and space for both of them.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:13.740]   Thanks so much.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.060]   - Well, it's a good question,
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.920]   because it pushes back against Arnold Bennett's model.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.940]   I talked about earlier in the show,
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.180]   Arnold Bennett, the cultural critic,
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.260]   late 19th century, early 20th century,
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.980]   wrote this book called "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day."
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.200]   And he argued, look, you work for eight hours, right?
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.580]   He was writing this at the beginning of something
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:37.740]   like the London, the birth of sort of like the London
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.060]   white-collar commuter class.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.660]   Like it was kind of the first time in history
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.940]   you had people who lived in the London suburbs
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.260]   and would take the train in.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.060]   They would work in buildings and take the train back.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.660]   And he was saying, okay, that takes eight hours.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.860]   Then you have eight more hours that are yours,
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.220]   and you can treat those eight hours
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.660]   as if you were the landed gentry,
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.460]   who would come up with things they wanted to do
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.060]   with their time and read poetry and fox hunt or whatever.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.520]   And he's like, you're as free as them during that time,
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.100]   take advantage of it.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.460]   Now put aside, it didn't cross his mind
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.500]   that there could be like domestic work to do here
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.980]   because he was writing for men
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.700]   and figured that would all be taken care of.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.160]   But put that aside, his argument was,
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.480]   you should be able to do in your second eight hours
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.720]   a lot of really deep, interesting, personal, creative work
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.700]   unrelated to the eight hours you did at the office.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.220]   And he pushed back on the myth
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.100]   that like the office work was going to exhaust you.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.580]   He's like, no, no, your brain wants to do stuff.
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.820]   It doesn't want to not do stuff.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.260]   I think what he was missing
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.860]   is that jobs weren't so deep back then, right?
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.980]   You would take the train, you would go to your office.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.680]   I don't know, I don't know what you were doing
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.900]   in like 1920s London white collar work,
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   but you were probably writing on paper or some things,
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.820]   and there was some meetings and it was,
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:56.820]   I mean, it would seem glacial compared to today's pace.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.900]   And the amount of actual like deep thinking
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.940]   that was probably having these jobs was minimal, right?
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.220]   It was like, I'm looking at these spending reports
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.660]   and with my fountain pen, like crossing things off
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.060]   and I'm going to pass it off to Willoughby
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.000]   and we're going to have Sherry with lunch.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.800]   So I think there was a lot more mental reserves
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.240]   than we have today in a job like yours,
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.180]   which is really hard.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.460]   All right, so I'm in a very similar situation.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.900]   So I kind of have good news, bad news for you.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.580]   I'm in a similar situation in that I have kind of
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.780]   multiple things I do that require deep work
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.180]   that I try to balance through, all right?
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.500]   I do exactly what you do.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.620]   Like I have found when I have non-professional deep work,
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.980]   the very best way to transition from work to non-work
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.860]   is psychologically, shut down routine,
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.820]   batten down all the hatches, close all the loops,
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.380]   followed by physical, some sort of big exercise.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.900]   So you have psychological transition, physical transition.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.020]   That's like the best you can do.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.260]   And I try to do that almost every day.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.780]   I exercise at the end of my workday.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.320]   That's when I do it.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.580]   It's the best transition I know.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.420]   Okay, I clear the chemicals out of my body.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.580]   I re-energize my body.
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.820]   I change my mindset.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:07.180]   It's a transition type of ceremony.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.020]   Works fantastic.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.980]   After doing a really clear shut down, shut down routine.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.580]   So I do the exact same thing you do.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.660]   Here's the bad news.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.900]   I also have the same issue
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.700]   where sometimes I just don't have it.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.140]   And I just need to take the foot off the accelerator
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.540]   for the evening.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.300]   So again, you said like, you know, that's just okay.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.940]   I want to reiterate, that's just okay.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.020]   My theory is often what's going on here
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.740]   is not cognitive fatigue.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.340]   I mean, often what it really is, is there's, you know,
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.020]   you have, I think there's like sicknesses.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.100]   Your body is always kind of fighting stuff off
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.780]   and it's kind of successful,
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.660]   but like some days it's less successful
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.580]   or your sleep wasn't great.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.460]   Like often I think if you do the right routine
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.860]   and you don't have the energy for the music,
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.720]   it's not because it was like extra hard, deep work at work,
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.620]   but like these other things were going on as well.
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:58.740]   Like if I have like,
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.980]   what feels like too much deep work during the day,
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   what's really happening,
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.380]   what's really affecting my evening
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.580]   is that I couldn't get my arm around enough
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.420]   of the shallow work because of that.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.940]   And I do my best to close the loops,
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.980]   but I feel sort of behind and that's kind of stressful
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.820]   and that drains me.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.140]   So there's all sorts of subtle reasons
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.460]   that can pull your ability to do a second shift
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.300]   of deep work.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.500]   So I think you're doing absolutely the right thing.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.660]   Be organized during your workday,
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.300]   close loops, do exercise,
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.620]   and then do your best with the time that comes after.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.780]   And it's okay if some days that's deeper than others.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.460]   It's all about the long game things are adding up.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.460]   So it's like good news, bad news.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.700]   Good news is I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.600]   Bad news is I don't necessarily have a magical answer.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.180]   All right, we have a case study here.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.620]   It's where people write into the show
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.260]   to talk about their personal experience,
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.860]   putting the type of things we talk about here
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.940]   into action in their own lives.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.960]   If you have a case study to share,
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   you can send them directly to Jesse@jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.460]   Today's case study comes from Omar.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.740]   Omar says, "I am a high school teacher
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.980]   "and would like to share how much the shutdown ritual
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.620]   "has been helping me."
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.940]   This is relevant to our call.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.600]   "I usually time block my days
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.920]   "and already know what to work on
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.780]   "during the time I am not teaching.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.000]   "During the day, I collect tasks or ideas
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.380]   "in Cal's time block planner
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.240]   "or on my working memory.txt file.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.320]   "I actually use Apple Notes Quick Note
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.840]   "so that I can quickly jot down notes on my computer
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.440]   "and get it out of my way.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.760]   "Every day, I protect 15 minutes at the end of the day
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.680]   "to do a shutdown ritual.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.400]   "I cannot express how many times my brain
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.040]   "is trying to tell me to keep working at home
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.820]   "or that I should start planning for the next day's lessons.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.340]   "By shutting down, I know I have everything under control
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.720]   "and it gives me a huge sense of relief.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.560]   "I know all my tasks on Trello are accounted for,
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.460]   "know if I have anything urgent come up
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.400]   "and know exactly how much time I have in the week
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.240]   "to prepare lessons.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.740]   "It has helped me immensely to be able
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.760]   "to enjoy my evenings better.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.600]   "Omar, I appreciate that case study.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   "Shutdown rituals make a difference.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.260]   "It is exhausting to have work in the back of your head
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.480]   "while you're trying to do other things
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.460]   "and do not overestimate how exhausting that is.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.660]   "To really close all the open loops,
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.360]   "to trust there's nothing you're keeping track of
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.200]   "only in your head
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.500]   "and that your plan for the rest of the week will work
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.340]   "and it's written down
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.960]   "and you'll get back to it in the morning
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.720]   "and to be able to say shutdown complete
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.540]   "or check that shutdown complete checkbox
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.880]   "in my time block planner,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.560]   "it makes a huge psychological difference.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.340]   "I absolutely swear by it."
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:25.480]   So this is a great case study.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.360]   Shutdown rituals matter.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.600]   My new thing is what we just talked about on the call
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.800]   is if possible, add a physical element to it as well
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.760]   so that the shutdown routine gives you first
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.240]   a psychological cleansing
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.640]   and then you can get a physical chemical cleansing
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.620]   by going for a run,
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.000]   working out at the home gym,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.860]   working out at the gym near your office
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.700]   before you come home,
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.720]   even just going for a long walk
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.240]   right when you get home,
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.480]   give yourself that physical cleansing as well
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   and then you're really ready
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.940]   as much as you can be for the evening.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.480]   All right, we have a final segment coming up here.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.680]   I wanna react to something I found on the internet this week
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.220]   but first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:08.280]   I wanna talk in particular about our friends at Shopify.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.120]   Look, if you were selling things online or in a store,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.660]   the technology used to do these sales absolutely matters.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.620]   This is where Shopify is so important.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:24.860]   Nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:27.780]   It's the number one checkout on the planet.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.860]   Let's think about businesses you may have heard of
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.420]   that use it.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.700]   Cotopaxi, they use it.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.620]   Feastables, they use it.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:42.020]   Thrive Cosmetics, they use it.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.060]   Like these are major brands
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.340]   but you know who else uses it?
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.020]   Like really small businesses, big businesses,
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.940]   medium-sized businesses.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.140]   I came across it just the other day.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.980]   I was ordering, 'cause I guess I need to own this.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.300]   I finally bought my own set of academic regalia.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.260]   The things you wear.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.180]   I have to go to fall convocation this year.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.980]   The site I ordered it from used Shopify.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:06.300]   It's such an easy checkout experience.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.660]   I recognized it right away.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.940]   So Shopify is what you should be using
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.780]   if you are selling something.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:17.180]   They have their shop pay feature boost conversions
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.500]   by up to 50% because it makes it so easy
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.540]   for people to check out.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.180]   The information is remembered across sites.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.700]   It's fantastic.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.260]   That means way less carts go abandoned
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.740]   and you make more sales.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.260]   So if you're growing into your business
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.100]   or your commerce platform better be ready to sell
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.220]   wherever your customers are scrolling or strolling
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.780]   on the web, in your store, in their feed
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.480]   and everywhere in between.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.980]   I just made that up off the fly there.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.820]   - I like it.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.860]   - Yeah, I just rhyme and I'm quite good
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.340]   at just kind of coming up with these types of things.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.500]   Businesses that sell more sell on Shopify.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.140]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.180]   that all of these other big brands
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.420]   as well as small brands use.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.740]   Sign up for your $1 per month trial period

[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.060]   But you have to type that in all lowercase
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.020]   for it to work and for you to get the deal.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:10.100]   So go to shopify.com/deep to upgrade your selling today.

[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.220]   Let's also talk about our friends at Element.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.220]   I'm a big fan of Element's zero sugar electrolyte mix.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.500]   You just add the water.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.260]   It gives you the stuff you need,
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.300]   especially after you've been dehydrated
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.420]   through like sweating or speaking a lot without the junk,
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.220]   without the sugar, without all the weird additives.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.020]   I actually, this is true Jesse,
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.220]   yesterday used my last Element packet.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.980]   And when I went down to the basement to get the new box,
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.060]   realized I'd used my last box.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.900]   So I have just ordered the day I'm doing this ad read
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.820]   had to order more Element
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.540]   because I use it after my workouts.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.420]   I use it after days where I'm giving a lot of speeches
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.660]   or doing a lot of podcasting.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.060]   And I do it in the morning
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.540]   if I'm particularly like not dehydrated, not feeling well,
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.420]   I throw in, you know, my Element electrolyte mix.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.260]   I really do use it.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.460]   I really do swear by it.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.820]   They have this new product coming out
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.020]   which I'm excited about, Element Sparkling,
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:14.100]   which now allows you to get that same electrolyte experience
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:19.100]   but in a bottle, already bottled for you in a can.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.180]   With each can, you can take a sip against sugar
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.260]   and stimulant loaded drinks
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.780]   and turn the tide towards health.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.380]   Element Sparkling right now
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.340]   is only available to Element Insiders.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.180]   So you can find out if you're an Element Insider
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.060]   at their website, drinkelement.com.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.980]   But it will be launching more broadly soon.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.740]   So get your free sample pack.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.500]   You'll get a free sample pack with any drink mix purchase
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.460]   if you go to drinkelement.com/deep.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:53.020]   That's drinkelementlmnt.com/drink.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.300]   And if you're an Element Insider,
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.660]   you'll have first access to Element Sparkling,
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.020]   a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.380]   Your free sample pack with any drink mix purchase
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.300]   at drinkelementlmnt.com/deep.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.340]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.820]   All right, this is where I like to react to things
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.980]   that readers send to us.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:17.380]   This article came into my interesting@calnewport.com
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.140]   email address where people send me things
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.620]   they think I'll find interesting.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.140]   I brought it up on the screen here
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.300]   if you're watching instead of listening.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:29.300]   So this is a message from Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy,
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.620]   that was being sent to all Amazon employees.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:36.380]   This was on September 16th that they sent it.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.260]   All right, so this is a look inside the CEO of Amazon
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.920]   talking about what's going well, what they need to work on.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.980]   There was a single idea in here that I wanted to highlight.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.980]   So a big thing he's worried about if you read this
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.660]   is that as Amazon grows, there's more managers
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.540]   and there's more managers and more layers.
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.140]   And this can kind of get in the way
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:59.780]   of actually taking action.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.940]   And so what they wanna do
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.860]   is they're actually cutting back on managers.
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.180]   They're trying to re-flatten things
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.420]   so there's less hoops you have to jump through
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.500]   to get approval for things
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.580]   or to actually take action on things.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.260]   One of the things he's doing, I'm gonna read this now,
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.020]   I wanna highlight to help support this effort
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.540]   of making the company more agile.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.500]   All right, so here's him writing.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.940]   "By the way, I've created a bureaucracy mailbox
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:30.220]   "for any examples that any of you see
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.240]   "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary processes
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.700]   "that's crept in and that we can root out."
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.540]   All right, so it's like very easy to report.
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.900]   It's like a tip line.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.120]   See something, say something,
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.580]   but about like unnecessary process or bureaucracy
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.000]   so they can be more relentless about getting rid of it.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.120]   I like this idea for the following general reason,
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.180]   and then I'm gonna give a specific variation on it.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.620]   The general idea I like here
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.180]   is knowledge work organizations in particular
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:02.820]   have lots of implicit processes by which work unfolds.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.840]   But I say implicit
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.960]   because they're not written down anywhere.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.380]   They're not named, they're not discussed.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.420]   Like the hyperactive hive mind workflow model
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.600]   where we work work out
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.420]   through ad hoc back and forth messaging.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.500]   That's a choice, but it's not really named and discussed.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.460]   It's just implicit that this is how we do it.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.660]   Informal personalized workload management.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.460]   Just ask people what you need when you need it.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.100]   It's up to them to push back when for whatever,
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.220]   when they finally feel like they have too much work
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.700]   and they just have to kind of do that.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.780]   Forget all the sort of interpersonal dynamics
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.540]   or asymmetric power dynamics there.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.420]   It's just everyone should manage their own workload.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.440]   So you just ask what you need from people.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.660]   Your workload is your business.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.340]   It's up to you to say no to people
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.180]   if you don't want more work.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.740]   That's another process that's implicit,
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.500]   but it's something that we do.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.940]   So anything that tries to bring more transparency
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:55.100]   and scrutiny to process, I think is important.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.980]   When you have to actually name, describe
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.840]   and defend the hyperactive workload hive mind,
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.720]   you begin to see there's some creaks there.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.260]   When you have to actually name and define
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.620]   and defend personalized workload management,
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.460]   you begin to say, you know what?
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.940]   Maybe there's better ways to do this,
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.260]   but you don't get to these better ways
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.100]   until you've actually named and talked about the ways
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.900]   that are actually happening right now.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.540]   And in the absence of naming them,
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.940]   we just think of like the way we work
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.100]   as being synonymous with work.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.340]   We have a hard time having the professional imagination
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.460]   to see that it could be different.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.780]   Here's the change I would make though.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.900]   In a lot of organizations,
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.740]   especially that aren't as big as like Amazon,
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.860]   the issue is not bureaucracy.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.420]   The issue is not the hoops they have to jump through.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.600]   The issue I always point out is attention destruction.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.900]   These like unnecessary context shifts.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.140]   What are the things that happen during the day
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.060]   that require me to change my attention
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.620]   from what I'm working on to other things?
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.580]   What are the things that happened during the day
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.380]   that reduced my ability to do the,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.700]   like the two or three things that I do
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.020]   that are most valuable to the company?
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.700]   It's like an attention destruction
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.260]   or attention poison mailbox.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.140]   That's what I would want.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.300]   Like, hey, CEO,
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.420]   I had seven non-urgent email conversations
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.700]   I had to kind of keep up with today
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.380]   and I could get nothing really done.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.480]   No hard thinking could actually happen.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   Like, hey, CEO, I'm averaging four meetings a day.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.420]   My average like uninterrupted,
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.660]   max size uninterrupted time block for day now
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.580]   is like under 60 minutes.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.660]   And yet my primary job is to write white papers
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.460]   and it's really making that hard to do.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.860]   That's what I would want reported.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.980]   And I would want my CEO to see again and again,
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.620]   report after report of like, my God,
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.460]   my people's ability to just put their mind
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.640]   to the work of producing value is being heavily diluted.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.620]   What do we do about this?
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:44.980]   And then solutions come in.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.140]   You have to have this mindset
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.420]   of there's existing processes.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.500]   Here's what they are, they're bad.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.340]   Here's alternatives.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.580]   If you're gonna fix this problem
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.100]   because the solutions are almost always less obvious,
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.180]   more complicated than what we do by default.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.140]   We aren't gonna stumble into the better way
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.860]   of doing this work.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.940]   We have to sort of move the whole,
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.540]   if I'm gonna use some physics analogies,
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.820]   we have to move the whole configuration
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.500]   of our work system to a different phase, right?
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.860]   We're gonna have to make an energy quant to shift.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.940]   And that requires a lot of energy input
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.700]   to shift to this new stable condition.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.660]   It's just the same.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.620]   And I'm sure you're all thinking the same thing right now.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.260]   It's just the same as like electron orbit levels.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.340]   I know you're all thinking that,
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.840]   but it takes a certain amount of energy, right?
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.060]   Often non-trivially to sort of move an electron
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.260]   to a next orbit level, but then it's in a stable,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.660]   once it's there, it doesn't take energy to maintain it.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660]   It's stable there.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.860]   So like the switch from one stable configuration
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.060]   to another takes a lot of energy input.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.660]   Most of knowledge work organizations
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.780]   are in like a particular,
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.300]   somewhat degenerate stable configuration.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.420]   They can't just easily move out of.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.340]   It's typically based on like low friction
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.260]   and flexibility and risk reduction.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.460]   But there's other configurations that if you can move
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.820]   to other ways of working and collaborating and talking
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.600]   and meeting and communicating and workload management,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.980]   there's these other configurations
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.660]   that if you could just get your organization there,
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.460]   they'll also be very easy to maintain and they're better.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.540]   You're gonna produce better work
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.740]   and people are gonna burn out less.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:15.620]   But to get there,
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.180]   someone has to put a ton of energy into that system.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.940]   And you're not gonna do that
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.260]   unless you know exactly what you're doing right now
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.380]   and what's wrong about it.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.180]   You're not gonna do that unless you get the 500 messages
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.460]   in your attention poison mailbox.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.740]   You set up a CEO and you're being drowned in this.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.940]   You realize like, oh my God,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.940]   this is terrible what we're doing.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.540]   You gotta know and name the problem.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.900]   You gotta understand its magnitude
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.900]   before you're willing to put in the magnitude
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.100]   of attention and energy required to fix it.
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.500]   So I think it's a cool idea what's going on in Amazon.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.600]   I would adapt it to focus less on bureaucracy
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.760]   and more on attention destruction.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.380]   But I like this general approach.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.940]   You don't know what to fix
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.300]   if you're not talking about what you're currently doing.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.220]   All right, speaking of fixing,
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.500]   I think we can fix the fact
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.460]   that this podcast is now ready to finish.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.460]   I don't know if that makes sense, Jesse.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.020]   It's not as good as my improv in the Shopify ad.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.760]   Where I just riffing, just riffing.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.860]   I guess I burnt out on that ability there.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.540]   Anyways, that's enough for today.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.460]   Thank you everyone for listening or watching.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.060]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.500]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.300]   Hey, if you like today's discussion about finding more time,
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.860]   I think you'll also like episode 239,
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:30.420]   which was titled On Stress and Time.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.920]   You'll enjoy it, check it out.
