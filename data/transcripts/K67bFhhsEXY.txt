[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   So if Jesus's work on earth was completely finished, what is he doing as my advocate in heaven right now?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.440]   That's a question that comes into us from Lynn on 1st John 2 verses 1 & 2. She writes, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   What is Christ doing as our advocate? As a child of God, I am redeemed, completely lacking nothing.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.560]   I am justified and forgiven of all my past sins, past, present, future. I am united with Christ. I belong to him.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.080]   I'm sealed in him, declared righteous in him, and sealed with his Holy Spirit. If I'm already seated in the heavenly places in Christ,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.760]   what exactly is Christ pleading with the Father for on my behalf? If his work on the cross was complete,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.680]   with God making him the propitiation of my sins,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:51.080]   why does Christ have to plead to God to continue to forgive me? Why is Christ now advocating for me before God?"
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.640]   Pastor John, what would you say to Lynn?
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.760]   Let me start with an unrelated text from Romans 11,
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.560]   simply to illustrate a point
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.120]   that
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.440]   governs how we think about the perplexities
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.760]   that arise
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760]   from trying to follow
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.760]   the paths of God in the way he saves sinners.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.280]   Oh, what a challenge!
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   Listen, listen to this
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   for a roundabout
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.200]   complexity of God's ways and how Paul responds to this roundabout,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.680]   complex way of saving Jews and Gentiles. This is
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   Romans 11 30 and following.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.240]   "Just as you Gentiles
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.920]   were at one time
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.200]   disobedient to God,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.840]   but now
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   have received mercy
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.880]   because of the disobedience of Israel,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.000]   so they too now have been disobedient
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.280]   For God has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all."
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   Now, how does Paul respond to that
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.640]   convoluted way of going about salvation in the world?
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.040]   This is the next verse. "Oh,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.520]   the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!"
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.200]   How unsearchable are his judgments? How
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.520]   inscrutable his ways? Now, pause there.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   He didn't mean his ways were inscrutable in the sense that we didn't have any insight into them.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   He just gave us in three chapters the most stunning insight into the way God saves Jews and Gentiles imaginable.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   He is actually saying, "God has granted me some insight and you through me some insight into these inscrutable ways."
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.000]   And we're saying, "Oh, the depth," not because we don't understand anything, but because we've seen enough to know how strange they are.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.680]   "For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.800]   counselor or who has given a gift to him that he should be repaid? For from him and through him and to
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.560]   him are all things. To him be glory forever and ever."
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   In other words,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.960]   when we come to read the Bible and
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.600]   trace out the ways of God in salvation, we should never come as
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.320]   counselors of God.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.480]   "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who has been his counselor?" Never. We should never come as
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.960]   ones who in any way could contribute any wisdom whatsoever
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.200]   to the ways of God and the way he goes about saving lost sinners.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.800]   Our business is to watch and listen and learn and insofar as we get some understanding,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   worship. "Oh the riches." That's the way we should respond. So now the question is posed,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.960]   given how wonderfully complete the work of Christ on the cross is in covering our sin and completing our
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.160]   righteousness, and given how complete the work of the Holy Spirit is in sealing us for the day of redemption,
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   how does Christ's ongoing
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.560]   advocacy or intercession
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.040]   relate to these things? Why is it even necessary, she asks.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.400]   So let's put it just two texts in front of us and see if they shed light on the answer.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.200]   1 John 2.1, "My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.320]   but if anyone does sin, now what's he gonna say next?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.240]   We have a cross? We have a crucifixion? We have an atonement? He says, "If anyone does sin, we have an advocate
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.080]   with the Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous."
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   So John doesn't simply say, "We have a Redeemer who died for us." He does say
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.680]   that. He does say that
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.000]   in the next verse. But here he says,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   "Take heart
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.320]   from the fact that this very day
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.880]   the day that you sin and confess it, Christ the Righteous One is your advocate in heaven." And
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.800]   is it not significant that he calls Jesus the Righteous One?
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.480]   Jesus Christ the Righteous.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:51.200]   Seems to me that the righteousness of Christ is highlighted here, not because we need an
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   upright lawyer in our defense,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   but because we ourselves are in Christ Jesus and are only accepted before the Father in the
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   Righteous One, and therefore the
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.480]   advocacy of Jesus is the ongoing
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.040]   presentation of the reality
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.480]   established at the cross and through faith and by the Spirit. God the Father
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.800]   doesn't just look back
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.200]   to the cross.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   He looks straight ahead
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   into the face of the living,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.760]   righteous Jesus Christ who is our
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   righteousness and is our
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.280]   life and is our purchase and our
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.080]   payment. In other words, we might think, like if we were writing the story, we might think
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.800]   that the work of Christ on the cross would be more magnified
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.840]   if all attention were backward on that event. God doesn't see it that way.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.560]   We need to rest and rejoice. God doesn't see it that way. That event, that past event,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.840]   led to a
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.720]   resurrection from the dead. It led to a coronation of the Son of God at the Father's right hand. It led to an
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.360]   ongoing
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:22.400]   embodiment in the God-Man, the mediator, of all that he had achieved and all that he is as our
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.800]   ground of
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   eternal salvation.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.360]   So one more passage, Romans 8 32.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.800]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.520]   how will he not with him graciously give us all things?" Now,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.320]   don't miss
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.400]   God's not sparing his son is
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.640]   the ground on the basis of which
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.280]   everything good that happens from now on to us sinners
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.560]   takes place from now to eternity. Everything good that happens to us is
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.200]   based on that not sparing his own son.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520]   There's no
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440]   minimizing of the Father's
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.760]   offering of the Son as a sacrifice. He's not minimizing it. That's the basis of everything
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.360]   good that comes to us. He's
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.280]   magnifying the death in the past
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   by drawing attention
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.520]   to what is achieved for the future as
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.000]   Christ keeps on working. And so he continues. That verse goes on like this,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.520]   "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect in the future?" Forever.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.720]   It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ is the one who died. Now pause. There he stresses it again.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.200]   Christ is the one who died. The death is the foundation of everything. And then he adds,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.560]   "More than that."
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.360]   So we should be thrilled that there's more than that. More than that who was raised,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us, who shall
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.520]   separate us then from the love of Christ. So the point
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   seems to be
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.080]   that the death of Christ is not the end, but the beginning and the
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:20.360]   foundation of everything good that God does for the elect. All of those excellencies that Lynn
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.080]   pointed out in her question, that God achieved,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480]   purchased forgiveness,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.320]   perfected righteousness,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.600]   devil conquered, these are
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.160]   foundation
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   for all that flows
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.760]   from the death of Jesus in the future of our everlasting salvation. And then Paul
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.400]   celebrates
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   the effects of this
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.120]   gloriously powerful death, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who's interceding for us.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.840]   Nobody can separate us. In other words,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.560]   resurrection because of the death that was decisive,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.600]   exaltation to the right hand of the Father because the death was decisive,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.440]   concession for us forever because the death was decisive,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.200]   never-ending love because the death proved it to be beyond doubt.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   So the connection between the death and the ongoing saving work of Christ is that the death makes it all
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.800]   possible. The death secures all that, purchases it, guarantees it, finds expression in it,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.960]   which may be the most important way to say it, finds expression in it. It's the death that our
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.440]   advocate presents and
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.480]   pleads. So let me try to say it in one sentence.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:53.000]   Maybe the shortest way to say it is that the advocacy or the intercession of
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.160]   Jesus for us
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.760]   before God the Father is that God himself—
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.160]   it's crucial because there's no division between the God and the Son here, like the Son's trying to twist the arm of the Father—
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.600]   God himself
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.640]   put Jesus there in the center of all things forever as the
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   crucified and risen Redeemer so that his person and his words
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.320]   might make
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:30.280]   gloriously plain forever that every minute of our joy in eternity is owing to the
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.880]   one
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   mediator with God and man, the man, the crucified and risen man,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.400]   Christ Jesus.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.760]   Amen. You expound the riches of Romans 8:32 like nobody else. Thank you, Pastor John. That was a really great question as well, Len.
