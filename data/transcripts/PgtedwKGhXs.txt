[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   The following is a conversation with Steven Pressfield,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   author of several powerful nonfiction
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.120]   and historical fiction books, including "The War of Art,"
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.920]   a book that had a big impact on my life
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.240]   and the life of millions of people
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.000]   whose passion is to create in art, science, business,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.740]   sport, and everywhere else.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.880]   I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.440]   including "Turning Pro," "Do the Work,"
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   "Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit," and "The Warrior Ethos."
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.480]   Also, his books "Gates of Fire" about the Spartans
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   and the Battle of Thermopylae, "The Lion's Gate,"
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.520]   "Tides of War," and others are some of the best
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.480]   historical fiction novels ever written.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.840]   As some of you know, I don't shy away
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   from taking on a big, difficult challenge.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.980]   One of the hardest for me and for millions of others
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600]   is the discipline of staring at an empty page every day,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.880]   pushing on to think deeply, to create,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.440]   despite the millions of excuses that fill the head.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.840]   In his work, Steven has articulated the struggle
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.140]   better than anyone I've ever read.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.640]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.420]   Two sponsors, "The Jordan Harbinger Show" and Cash App.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.200]   Please consider supporting the podcast

[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.520]   It really is the best way to support this podcast.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.760]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400]   I recently considered renaming this podcast,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.080]   but decided against it.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.200]   AI is my passion, and in some sense,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.560]   this podcast is not as much about AI,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.000]   but more about a journey of an AI researcher
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   struggling to explore the human mind,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.280]   the physics of our universe,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.320]   and the nature of human behavior,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.420]   intelligence, consciousness, love, and power.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.660]   I will continue to return home to the technical,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.080]   computer science, machine learning,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.920]   engineering, math, programming,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.740]   but also venture out to talk to people
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.840]   who had a big impact on my life
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.900]   outside the technical fields.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.140]   Writers like Steven Pressfield and Stephen King,
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.520]   musicians like Tom Waits,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.560]   political leaders like, well, you know who,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680]   and even athletes.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.040]   I hope you join me on this journey.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.520]   and no ads in the middle
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760]   that can break the flow of the conversation.

[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.760]   It's the best way to support this podcast.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   This episode is supported by the Jordan Harbinger Show.

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.740]   It's how he knows I sent you.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.060]   On that page, there's links to subscribe to it,
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.820]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.900]   I've been binging on this podcast.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.500]   Jordan is a great human being.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.200]   He gets the best out of his guests,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.060]   dives deep, calls them out when it's needed,
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.380]   and makes the whole thing fun to listen to.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.380]   He's interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban,
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.720]   Neil deGrasse Tyson, Garry Kasparov,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.940]   and many more.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.180]   I just finished listening to his recent conversation
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.920]   with Mick West about debunking conspiracy theories.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.380]   This topic can be both fascinating and frustrating
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.980]   on both sides.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.300]   But in this conversation,
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.380]   Jordan thread the needle beautifully.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.860]   And so it turned out to be a great listen.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.780]   I highly recommend it.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.900]   Again, go to jordanharbinger.com/lex.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.820]   It's how he knows I sent you.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.740]   On that page, there's links to subscribe to the show,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.820]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.880]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.480]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.980]   When you get it, use code LEX, podcast.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.080]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.160]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.300]   with as little as $1.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.520]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.480]   let me mention that the cryptocurrency
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.960]   in the context of the history of money is fascinating.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.000]   I recommend "A Scent of Money"
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.060]   as a great book on this history.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.480]   Debits and credits on ledgers started
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   around 30,000 years ago.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.800]   The US dollar created over 200 years ago.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.040]   And the first decentralized cryptocurrency
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.320]   released just over 10 years ago.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.640]   So given that history,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.240]   cryptocurrency is still very much
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.440]   in its early days of development.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.880]   But it's still aiming to,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.840]   and just might, redefine the nature of money.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.480]   So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.840]   or Google Play, and use the code LEX, podcast,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.280]   you get $10.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.000]   And Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.320]   an organization that is helping advance robotics
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   And now, here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.240]   - Modern society in many ways dreams
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.300]   of creating universal peace.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.880]   And yet war has molded civilization
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.760]   as we know it throughout its history.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   So let's start at the high philosophical level.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   If you could imagine a world without war,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.440]   how would that world be different?
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.800]   Perhaps put another way, what purpose has war served?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.400]   Why do we fight?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.740]   - I think we're basically the same creatures internally
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.440]   that we were in the cave, right?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.280]   In tribal society back for however many,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.840]   you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of years.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.680]   Which means that we're in,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.360]   the dynamic in our mind is a kind of an us versus them
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.000]   dynamic where our tribe is the people
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   and everybody else are whatever, you know?
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   And I don't see that, I don't think that's changed one iota
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520]   over the centuries.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.360]   It's just a question of how one might sublimate
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.080]   that urge to compete.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   You're a martial artist, you know,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   a great part of your day I'm sure is dedicated
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   to reaching that place of total commitment
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.280]   and in the face of competition,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.120]   in the face of adversity, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.920]   which is I think natural and great for the human race
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   on an individual basis.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.680]   So the hope that I have, if there is any hope,
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.040]   personally I don't think the human race
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.920]   is gonna be around very long,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   but would be in sports
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.480]   or in other kind of sublimated activities
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.560]   where people can act out their need for conquest
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.220]   or aggression or so forth,
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.080]   but at the same time relate to their opponents
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.380]   as human beings and when the game is over,
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.280]   you know, you embrace your competitor and stuff like that.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.320]   - So you think war was inevitable?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   It's a part of human nature as opposed to a force,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.120]   a creative force in society that served a benefit.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.240]   - Well, I'm sure it has benefited, you know,
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.960]   spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like that,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   but I think the urge to conquest,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.000]   if you think about Alexander the Great
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.320]   or Julius Caesar or Napoleon or anybody like that
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.040]   or even individual or if we even think about
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.200]   one of the plants that we're looking at right outside,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.080]   I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   it would take over, you know, the whole hillside.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let's say,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.720]   there were, who knows, over the face of the earth,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.240]   hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.440]   you know, Asia, Europe, wherever,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.240]   and every prince that grew up
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.520]   dreamt of conquering his neighbor
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.560]   and conquering a neighbor after that.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   That seems to be a universal human imperative,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.080]   at least in the male of the species.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.920]   - So war is just a realization of that imperative.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.320]   - I think so.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.200]   - So you've written about Spartans
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.400]   in the Battle of Thermopylae,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.520]   about Alexander the Great,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.320]   about the Six-Day War in '67 in Israel
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.360]   against Egypt, Jordan, Syria.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.280]   What war, not just out of those, but in general,
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   do you think has been most transformative for the world?
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.680]   - Well, these are great questions, Lex.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.560]   - Tough, easy ones, right?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.120]   - I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.660]   'cause I certainly, from what little I know,
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.360]   I think that was a very,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.200]   their conquests were very transformative,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   bringing cultures, you know, in a horrible, bloody way
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   together, but gosh, what's been the most transformative?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.480]   Maybe the Roman conquests, you know,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.680]   establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.480]   Maybe Alexander the Great's wars that, you know,
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.280]   united East and West, at least for a minute.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.580]   - So building a vampire, do you have a sense,
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.080]   so there's wars, I mean, the Six-Day War
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.640]   is not about building empires.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   It's about deep, deeply held religious,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.280]   cultural conflict and holding the line, holding the border.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.440]   And then there is conquests, like the Mongols,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.840]   that, what is it, some large percentage of the population
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.260]   is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right?
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.400]   So that has transformative effects.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.840]   And then World War II, I mean, personally,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.800]   my family and so on, the transformative effects.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.080]   - Let me ask you this, Lex.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.540]   Why are you, what are you trying to get at
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.880]   with these questions?
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.160]   What is this kind of the theme that you're aiming at?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.120]   - Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein, and he said,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.380]   "Everything is great about war except the killing."
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.040]   (Lex laughs)
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.520]   And there's a romantic notion of war.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.920]   Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.440]   but there's a romantic notion of war
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.100]   that somehow there's a creative force to it.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:37.200]   That because we fight, out of that fighting comes culture,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.280]   comes music and art, and more and more desire to create
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.760]   with the societies that win.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.320]   And to me, war is not just,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   "Hey, I have a stick, and I want your land."
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.340]   It's some kind of, like it has echoes of the creative force
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:05.900]   that makes humans unique to other animals.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.700]   Like, war is, it can't be just four people,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.580]   or 10 people, or 100 people.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.700]   You have to have thousands of people agreeing,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.700]   usually thousands or more, for something so deeply
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.960]   that you would be willing to risk your own life.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.900]   And there's a romantic notion to that.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.460]   And because you've written so well and passionate
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.900]   about some of these, I wanted to see,
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.180]   'cause I don't have any answers,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.940]   I wanted to untangle that.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.700]   If there is a reason we fight that's more than just
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.300]   anger and hate and wanting to conquer.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.460]   - Well, let me take it from a completely different side.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.580]   I don't think that I, in writing about war,
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.260]   am really that interested in war per se.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.500]   I'm more interested in the metaphor.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.060]   I think, for me, I'm really writing about
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.060]   my own internal war, and the war against myself,
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.980]   and against my own resistance, my own negativity,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.100]   all of those things that are,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:20.340]   that spirituality would be the opposite of.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.940]   So I'm not really an expert on war.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.740]   It's not like talking to Jim Mattis,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   or to Victor Davis Hanson, or whatever.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:37.860]   To me, the human being,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.860]   we are spiritual beings in a physical envelope.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:48.100]   And there's an automatic, terrible tension within that,
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:53.180]   and which creates a war inside ourselves.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.180]   So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.460]   standing up to whatever, 10 to one odds,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.460]   or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.140]   of the fight we're fighting inside ourselves.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.380]   For me, the Six Day War was, as you know,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.640]   my feeling was it was about a return from exile.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.500]   It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.340]   of the State of Israel,
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.840]   which had never really been completed,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.660]   because the holiest places of the Jewish people
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.300]   were in the hands of their enemies.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.620]   So now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great's conquest,
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.340]   I think, were a whole other different scenario,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.340]   where the metaphor was that Alexander's father, Philip,
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.400]   I think, created the first nation, capital N Nation,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.340]   and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.340]   who were mountain men, and basically barbarians, Macedonians,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:01.500]   and by creating this army and this dream
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   of conquering the world,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.300]   which Alexander took to the, you know, really enacted,
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.120]   he gave them a way of rising out of themselves,
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.980]   of transcending themselves, not just individually,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.060]   but as a people.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.420]   So that would go along with what you're saying, Lex,
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.300]   of a certain creativity to it.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.660]   But again, that's not, for whatever,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.740]   and I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this,
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.420]   that's not really what's interesting to me
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.380]   about these stories.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.620]   And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae,
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.580]   that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.580]   That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.540]   for a greater cause, just like, to me,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.600]   the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.500]   what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.220]   I don't know if that answers your question,
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.300]   but that's how I see it.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.620]   I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.100]   to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time,
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.860]   and I decline because I don't really feel
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.580]   like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.160]   or anything like that.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:23.020]   That's not what's interesting about it to me.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.580]   - But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.220]   that we're all essentially, in various ways, warriors?
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.940]   - If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes,
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.940]   and we think of our life, at least as males,
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.060]   and the earliest archetypes that kick in
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.540]   are the youth and the wanderer and the student
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.500]   and that kind of thing.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.180]   And then at some point around age 15 to 20, whatever,
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.500]   the warrior archetype kicks in,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.700]   and we wanna play football, we wanna do martial arts,
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.860]   we wanna join the special forces,
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.960]   we wanna hang out with our buddies, that's our great bond,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.060]   we wanna test ourselves against adversity
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.360]   and so on and so forth.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.940]   But at some point, that archetype,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.740]   we move beyond that archetype,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.620]   and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.380]   And then there are many archetypes
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.380]   beyond that towards the end.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.380]   So I'm interested in the warrior archetype,
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.460]   but not to the be all and end all of everything else.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:34.780]   In my book, "The Virtues of War," have you read that?
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.460]   There's a character named Telamon,
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.460]   who's actually, it's a long story,
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.380]   but he's with Alexander's army,
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.820]   and when they arrive in India,
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.820]   he becomes fascinated by the gymnosophists,
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.620]   the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.020]   And he says to Alexander that these guys
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.540]   are warriors beyond what we are,
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.380]   even though they do nothing
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.380]   because they are inside their own selves all day long.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.700]   - If we go to the Six-Day War,
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.660]   you write about, in Lionsgate,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.780]   you write about the Six-Day War in Israel.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.660]   I think of the wars you've written about
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.100]   as the one we're still, in many ways,
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.260]   in the midst of today.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.540]   - Yes.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.540]   - So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.900]   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.860]   - I mean, today it's the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.460]   but it's echoes of the same conflict
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.380]   in that part of the world with Israel.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.500]   What is, in your sense,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.540]   the nature of that conflict?
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.740]   What can we learn about society and human nature
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.200]   from that conflict?
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.860]   That is one of the hottest conflicts
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.820]   that still goes on today.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.740]   - Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate,
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.340]   about the Six-Day War,
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.780]   I wrote in the introduction
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.220]   that this was not gonna be a multi-sided story.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.380]   I was taking it entirely,
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.180]   I'm a Jew, I identify with the Israeli people,
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.780]   I was gonna see it entirely from their side.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.120]   So that's probably not what you're asking,
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   but to me, the Six-Day War and that whole,
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.780]   you know, it's a piece of land that's holy
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.620]   to at least three religions and probably more.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.760]   And from the Jewish point of view,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.220]   it's where the State of Israel,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.780]   it's where David founded Jerusalem,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.700]   it's all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.900]   where Moses came and brought the people.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   So to me, the Six-Day War was about, as I said,
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.380]   a return from exile, from diaspora after 2,000 years.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.540]   Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.300]   or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.020]   it's a whole other scenario.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.940]   - Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   but religious beliefs.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.940]   - Religion and racial/ethnic/tribal identity.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.060]   I mean, again, what is a Jew?
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.220]   Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.380]   or is it somebody of a certain race
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.700]   that race arose in a certain place?
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.460]   Same thing as a Muslim, what is a Muslim?
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.200]   Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.380]   Or did they arise in a certain place
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.500]   and a certain ethnicity?
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.020]   'Cause if we landed from Mars,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.260]   we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we?
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.860]   Just looking at them, you could easily mix them
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.060]   and you'd never know.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.260]   - And the specifics of the faith
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.700]   is not necessarily the thing that defines a person.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.340]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.060]   - So you could be, like many are, secular Jew
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.500]   living in Israel and still have a strong bond.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.540]   - Definitely, definitely.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.460]   In fact, almost all of the Jews,
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.020]   the fighters that I spoke to from the Sixth Day War
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   were secular and it really was not
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.420]   a religious thing with them
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.360]   as much as it was a national thing.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.820]   - So having spent time in Israel,
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.700]   how's the world where military conflict is directly felt
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.220]   as opposed to maybe if we look at the US
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.180]   where it's distant and far away.
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.380]   How is that world different?
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.460]   How are the people different?
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.300]   - It's very different, as you know.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.860]   - I've never been to Israel actually.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.700]   - Oh, you haven't?
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.580]   - I haven't felt it.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.940]   - Well, you should definitely go.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.260]   I mean, here in the United States,
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.140]   where when an incident like Charlottesville comes up,
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.980]   where people are chanting,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.260]   "Jews will not replace us," blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.740]   The impulse in the Jewish community is to think of,
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.340]   well, how can we reach out to the other side?
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.720]   How can we either show them that we are human beings
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.180]   like they are and show them that we care for them,
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.000]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.180]   That's the sort of distant from war.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.860]   From if you're in Israel,
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.380]   like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now,
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.740]   you would be a fighter pilot
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.060]   or a tank commander or whatever.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.580]   You would not just be working at MIT or whatever.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.780]   And I would be in the Army too.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.740]   And so from their point of view,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.780]   they say all those people who hate us,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.740]   can I curse on this thing?
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.180]   Fuck them, we'll kill 'em.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.740]   If they dare to cross the line,
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.940]   and that's a whole different point of view.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.300]   To me, it's actually a healthier point of view.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.140]   - You think so?
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.660]   - Yeah.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.260]   - So let me ask the hard question is,
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.380]   well, maybe it's an impossible question,
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.980]   is how do we resolve that conflict?
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.180]   - In Israel and--
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.460]   - In Israel or--
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.300]   - Anywhere.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   - Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   and say F you and the people, yeah.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:19.100]   - I think that the only way the two warring sides
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.500]   or two sides that are opposed to one another
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.020]   can ever really come together
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.740]   is when there's mutual respect.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.580]   We'll get to some more water.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.420]   - I got it, I got it.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.180]   - When there's mutual respect
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.220]   and they can see each other as equals
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.660]   and when there's mutual fear,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.780]   where one side says,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.540]   we don't dare cross a line with this other side
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.500]   and the other side says the same thing.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.660]   I think then you can kind of reach across that thing
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.340]   and say, okay, we'll stay here, you stay here.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.620]   We'll mingle in cultural ways
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.580]   and we'll have interchange, winter marriage,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.100]   da, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.900]   But as soon as one side has no power,
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.300]   as the Jewish people have had no power
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.780]   throughout the diaspora forever,
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.660]   then it's just a human nature.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.380]   You can see it in Trump
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   and what he does to any vulnerable minority.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:18.500]   And he's not alone, I'm not blaming him alone.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.900]   That's human nature.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.780]   So I do think that that idea of like, fuck you,
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.780]   if you cross the line, we'll kill you,
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.180]   is really a good way, is a good place to start from
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.980]   because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.180]   and say, what do we have in common?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.140]   How can we, we wanna raise our children,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.660]   you wanna raise your children,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.860]   how can we do this in a way
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.140]   that we're not hurting each other?
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.660]   - So you kind of said that you need to arrive
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.780]   at a balance, some kind of balance of power.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.620]   - Yeah.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.260]   - But you haven't spoken to the fact
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   that there's deeply rooted hatred of the other.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.300]   So is there no way to alleviate that hatred or is that,
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.900]   I mean, what role does love and hate--
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.740]   - I think that hatred can go away, I really do.
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.140]   I mean, if you look at even now
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.700]   that I haven't seen this in person,
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.700]   but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.220]   are collaborating on certain things,
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.500]   by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.460]   I do think that even really long, long, long standing
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.860]   hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.820]   can go away under the right circumstances.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.220]   - On what time scale?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.620]   - I mean, for instance, I don't know if it's--
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.380]   - Do people have to die,
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.540]   do generations have to die and pass away
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   and new generations come up with less hate
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.380]   or can a single individual learn to not hate?
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.580]   - I think a single individual can learn to not hate
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.060]   'cause it certainly doesn't seem to,
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.380]   over thousands of years doesn't seem to work.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.580]   We keep thinking that that's gonna happen,
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.580]   but I think we're in a real spiritual realm here
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.380]   when you're talking about that.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.900]   You're in a realm of Buddha, Jesus, whatever,
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.900]   something like that, that where a true change of soul happens
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.180]   but I do think that's possible.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.940]   - So what do you think is the future of warfare,
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.340]   especially with what many people see
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.020]   as the expansion of the military industrial conflict?
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.640]   I know you're not a military historian.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.300]   I'm asking more as a metaphor.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.400]   Do you see us as people continuing to fight?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.740]   - You know, it's a really great question, Alex,
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   because I think now with social media, TV, movies,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:55.220]   all of these things that create empathy across cultures,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.860]   it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think,
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.100]   to totally demonize the other,
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.140]   the way it was in previous wars.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.820]   I also think I don't really see an appetite
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.100]   for people wanting to go to war these days
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.180]   and in a way, I don't know if that's good or bad.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.620]   It's like everybody's so fat and lazy
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.540]   and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   that whereas I know at the start of World War I,
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.660]   both the younger generations were eager to go to war.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.660]   I think it was insane but it was that sort of
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.340]   warrior archetype that we were talking about
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.340]   before that generational testosterone eros thing
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:48.100]   whereas nowadays, I don't know.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.220]   I mean, it's hard to say there's not gonna be another war
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.940]   because there always are but it's sort of hard
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.260]   to imagine people getting off their ass these days
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.420]   to do anything.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.460]   - Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.060]   as a place for empathy, sure, but in a sense,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.020]   it's a place for war as well.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.860]   - For hatred, yeah, true.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.860]   - For hatred and perhaps the positive aspect of hatred
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:20.100]   on social media is that it's somewhat less harmful
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.260]   than murder and so it kind of dissipates
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.900]   sort of the hateful, you get the hate out
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.940]   but on a daily basis and thereby never boils up
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.500]   to a point where you want to kill.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.340]   - It's also a really weird thing that's going on
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.860]   and I don't know if anybody really understands
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.740]   like with video games where kids are acting out
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.020]   these incredible horror things, right?
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.700]   But you know that if they cut their finger,
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.780]   they would like freak out, you know?
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.900]   And I also don't think that many of the people
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.420]   that are hateful on social media,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.420]   if they were face to face with the person,
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.300]   so there's a sort of a two mental spheres
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.220]   happening at the same time and I don't know how that--
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.260]   - Maps to the actual military,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.540]   how that actually maps to military conflict.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.780]   - Like if you in the United States have a draft,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.460]   for example, how the populace would respond different
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.500]   than they did in previous generations.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.860]   - Yeah, I think they certainly would.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.820]   - Yeah.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.260]   - Another question, not sure if you've thought about it,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.140]   but I work on building artificial intelligence systems.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.780]   In our community, many people are worried
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.740]   about AI being used in war,
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.120]   so automating the killing process.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.100]   With drones and in general, it's being used more and more.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.660]   - I should recuse myself on that one,
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.740]   I really haven't thought about that.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.580]   - You haven't thought about it.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.300]   - I'd rather ask you what you think about it.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.260]   - Well, it's interesting, I mean,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.900]   because it's so fundamentally different
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.060]   from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.900]   It means just if we talk about the difference
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.500]   between a gun and a sword.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.380]   - I'll tell you one little anecdote.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.580]   There was a Spartan king, I don't know which one it was,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.740]   but at one point they showed him a new invention
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.660]   and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.420]   at a range of 200 yards.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   And the king wept and said, "Alas, valor is no more."
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.100]   (laughing)
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.500]   'Cause their point of view of war,
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.940]   it was highly ritualized, as you know,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.540]   and the code of honor was that you were not supposed
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.340]   to be able to kill another person unless you yourself
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.300]   were in equal danger of being killed.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.820]   And any other way of doing that, even bow and arrow,
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.820]   was considered less than manly and less than honorable.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.360]   And maybe we should go back to that
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.660]   because at least it makes the stakes real and true.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.780]   - And--
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.220]   - Not that we could.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.200]   - Not that's the point.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.980]   You were in the Marine Corps, so we talk about the real,
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.560]   the bloody conflicts, you've written about many of them.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.260]   So let me ask a personal question.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.300]   Have you, sort of as writing and in general,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.920]   have you thought about what it takes to kill a person
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.740]   if you yourself could do it in the war?
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.220]   - I have thought about it, yeah.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.900]   - And how that would make you feel?
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.620]   - Of course, one never knows.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.320]   I certainly, I have not been in combat,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.580]   I haven't killed anybody, but I would imagine
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.580]   in the real world that it would change you utterly forever
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.780]   because you can't help but identify
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.260]   with the person that you've just killed.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.300]   And it's another human being, and I mean,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.100]   I have a hard time killing a spider.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.860]   So I would imagine that it's something
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   that warriors understand and nobody else understands.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.620]   - And you've spoken with many.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.300]   I mean, you've spoken with people
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.940]   who've seen military combat in Israel.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.620]   What, have they been able to articulate
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.980]   the experience of killing?
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.100]   - It's sort of just what I said.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.600]   I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.580]   that I interviewed over there
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.860]   who was strafing a tank in his Mustang
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:48.100]   and saw at really low altitude
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.860]   and saw what his bullets did to the guy
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.900]   and could see his face and everything like that,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.340]   which is even one remove or more removes
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.180]   from an infantryman, what an infantryman does.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.000]   And he said that same thing that I said,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.620]   that it just changes you and you can never say it,
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.020]   never look at the world or look at anything
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.620]   the same way again.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.700]   - And when that happens at scale,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.120]   so it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.580]   that changes entire societies.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.540]   I mean, that's what we've seen.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.180]   - At least it, but the problem is
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.420]   it doesn't change the politicians back home.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.260]   - Right.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.700]   How important is mortality, finiteness,
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:32.260]   the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:37.260]   So killing in war really emphasizes that,
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.340]   but in general, the fact that this thing ends.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.860]   - It does?
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.700]   - It does.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.100]   - Shit.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.660]   And on a serious note, do you think about your own mortality?
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.540]   Do you meditate on your own mortality
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.260]   when you think about the work you do?
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.380]   - That's another great question, Alex.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.500]   I actually, I'm 75 and I just was having,
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.660]   I had breakfast in New York a few months ago
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.940]   with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.660]   And I said to him, I said,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.980]   "Nick, do you ever think about mortality?"
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.740]   And he said, "Every fucking minute of every day."
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.060]   And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.700]   But I actually, I always have, I think.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.700]   And I think, you know, the fact of mortality
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.260]   is kind of gives meaning to life.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.560]   You know, I think that's why we wanna create.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.580]   That's why we wanna make a mark of some kind or,
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.300]   and the other aspect of it is
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.380]   what's on the other side of that mortality.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.780]   I'm a believer in previous lives.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.100]   So I sort of, and I,
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.300]   the question I've never been able to answer
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.040]   among many, many others is like, why are we even here?
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.940]   Why are we in the flesh?
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.360]   You know, I sort of, I like to believe that God
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.680]   or some force is, we're on some kind of journey.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   But I'm not sure why we were put in this world
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.920]   where the ground rules are, if you think about animal life,
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.680]   that you cannot live from one day to the next
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.800]   without killing and eating some other form of life.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.820]   I mean, what a demented thing, you know?
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.120]   Why couldn't we just have a solar panel on our head
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.520]   and, you know, be friends with everybody?
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:40.200]   So I sort of, I don't get what that was all about,
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.400]   but that's sort of the big issue.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.960]   - Have you read the Ernest Becker's "The Null of Death,"
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.200]   for example?
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.120]   Is that Ernest Becker's a philosopher
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   that said that the death,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   that the fear of death is really the primary driver
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.460]   of everything we do.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.480]   So Freud had what, the--
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.440]   - Right, I would agree with that.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.720]   - So to you, you've always thought about your,
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.120]   even your own mortality.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.880]   - Yes, definitely.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   - And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.800]   of what you were talking about?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.400]   Like that we kind of,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.620]   what's your sense that we had previous lives?
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.760]   In what, have you thought concretely
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.920]   or is it a lot of it kind of is--
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.560]   - No, I've thought concretely about it.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   I mean, it's very clear when you see children,
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.800]   young kids, or even dogs and cats,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.240]   that they come into the world with personalities.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.920]   You know, and three kids in a family
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.720]   are gonna be completely different
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.440]   and completely their own person.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   And that person that they are doesn't change over life.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:56.000]   And I, you know, there's one of the things that I did in
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.020]   my book, "The Artist's Journey,"
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.760]   is that there were certain things where I tracked
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.880]   or just listed in order,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.400]   like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.480]   or all of Philip Roth's books,
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.960]   you know, kind of a body of work throughout over,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.000]   you know, a period of 30, 40, 50 years, you know.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And you can see that there's a theme running through
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.600]   all of those things,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.760]   that it's completely unique to that person.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.160]   Nobody else could have written Philip Roth's books
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.040]   or Bruce Springsteen's songs.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.600]   And you can even see sort of a destiny there.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.000]   So I asked myself, well, where did that come from?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.520]   What, it seems to be a continuation of something
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.720]   that was, that happened before,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.400]   and that will lead to something else,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.000]   because it's not starting from scratch.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.240]   It seems like there's a calling,
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.320]   a destiny in there already.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.020]   This gets back to the muse and all that kind of thing.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.520]   - So yeah, it's almost like the, there's this,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.280]   let's call it a god, it's passing,
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.300]   it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.820]   that has lived and putting those into the new one.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.040]   - Sampling, this is probably a pretty good word.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.960]   - Taking some of the good,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.560]   well, you can't take all the good parts,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.960]   because the bad parts is what makes the person.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.800]   - Right.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.160]   - So you're taking it all together.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.200]   Okay, is this humans only,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.320]   or does it pass around from animals in your view?
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.080]   - I don't know, that's above my pay grade, I don't know.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.200]   - So, okay, so you talk about the muse
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   as the source of ideas, maybe.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:44.280]   Since you've gotten a few glimpses of her in your writing,
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.440]   tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her?
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.720]   Where does she reside?
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.960]   What does she look like?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.680]   - I mean, you can look at it in many different ways.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.520]   The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way, right?
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.800]   They created gods that were like human beings.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.440]   But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.320]   Jewish mysticism, you could say that it's the soul,
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.840]   the neshama, right?
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.360]   That the soul is above us on a higher plane,
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.520]   our own, your soul, my soul,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.760]   and it's trying to reach down to us
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.400]   and communicate with us.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.680]   And we're trying simultaneously to reach up to it
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.840]   through prayer or through, if you're a writer or an artist,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.000]   when you sit down at the keyboard,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.560]   you're entering into a kind of prayer.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.520]   You're entering into a different state
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.480]   of an altered consciousness, to some extent.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.960]   You're opening yourself, opening the pipeline,
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.600]   turning on the radio to tune into the cosmic radio station.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.280]   And another way of looking at it,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   this is, did you ever see the movie "City of Angels"?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.240]   The visual of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and--
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.320]   - Oh, Nicholas Cage? - Nicholas Cage.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.200]   - Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, yep.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.240]   - And right, the visual of the movie sort of was
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.960]   Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.320]   And as she's operating on somebody,
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.800]   suddenly Nicholas Cage in this long duster coat,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.680]   like Jesse James, appears right next to her
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.940]   in the operating room, and he's an angel.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.600]   And he's waiting to take out the soul of the patient
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.980]   on the operating table.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.740]   And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.820]   and so is everybody else in the operating room,
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.860]   except maybe the guy who's about to die,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.460]   who suddenly sees him.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.460]   But I kind of believe that there are beings like that,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.620]   or if you don't like that, it's a force,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.860]   it's a consciousness, it's something,
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.460]   that are right here, right now.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.560]   And they're trying to communicate to us.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.180]   And like through a membrane,
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.180]   like tapping on that window over there,
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.740]   they're like right out there.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.580]   And they carry the future.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.140]   They are everything that is in potential.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.340]   All the works that you will do, Lex,
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.460]   your startup, whatever else you're doing,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.780]   they know that.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.420]   And it's not really you that's coming up with those ideas,
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.680]   in my opinion.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.740]   Those things are appearing,
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.100]   it's like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:33.100]   I mean, in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses appear,
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.860]   along with the human antagonists
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.980]   on the battlefield all the time, right?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.900]   There'll be Homer flashes to Olympus
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.540]   and then back to the real world.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.300]   And there's a thing where one Aphrodite,
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.900]   let's say, wants to help Paris.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.460]   And so she says, "Well, I will appear to him in a dream.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.760]   "And I'll take the form of his brother.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.680]   "And I'll say, bum-ba-da-bum-ba-da-bum."
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   So that's creatures, beings on one dimension,
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.620]   as the Greeks saw it, communicating with,
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.380]   and I believe that that's exactly what's going on,
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.580]   in one, whatever analogy you wanna use.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.900]   - That communication, to which degree
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.540]   do you play the role in that communication?
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.140]   As opposed to sitting at the computer,
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:27.180]   if you're a writer, and staring at the blank page,
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.500]   and putting in the time and waiting.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.300]   So if, in your view,
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:40.400]   are these creatures basically waiting
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.980]   to tell you about your future? (laughs)
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   Or is there choice?
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.740]   How many possible futures are there?
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.500]   How many possible ideas are there?
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.700]   - That's a great question.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.500]   I think there's basically,
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.140]   yes, there are alternatives, you know,
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.820]   degrees within it.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.760]   But if you look at Bruce Springsteen's albums,
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.860]   how much could he have done really differently?
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.620]   Yeah, you can just see there's a whole impetus
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.400]   going through the whole thing.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.120]   And nothing was gonna shake him off that, you know?
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.900]   And yeah, maybe the river could have been different,
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.700]   could have been called something else,
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:23.100]   but he was dealing with certain issues.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.260]   His conscious self was dealing with certain issues
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.060]   that were really out of his control.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.940]   He was drawn, he was called to it, right?
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.800]   Nothing could stop him.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.340]   And so it is sort of a partnership, I think,
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.180]   the creative process between,
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.600]   and creative impulse that's coming from some other place,
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.140]   or it's coming from deep within us
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.500]   is another way to look at it.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.540]   You know, it's like if we're acorns
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.340]   and we're growing into oaks.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.220]   So the conscious artist
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.040]   who's sitting there at the keyboard or whatever
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.820]   is applying his or her consciousness to that,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.960]   but is also going into opening themselves
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.140]   to the unconscious or to this other realm,
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.140]   whatever that is.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.560]   I mean, certainly songwriters for a million years have said,
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.940]   you know, a song just came into their head, right?
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.020]   Poem, just all they had to do is write it.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.940]   But then you ever see that thing where,
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.340]   of Keats's notes for "A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever"?
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.740]   It's like covers an entire page.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.980]   And it's like, you know, he's crossing this out
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.820]   and that out and the other thing.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.660]   So his consciousness, his conscious mind is working on it.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.620]   But I do think it's a partnership.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.080]   And I think that,
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.600]   I know when I was first starting out as a writer,
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.660]   I worked in advertising
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.020]   and I tried to do novels that I could never do.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.420]   I was like really unskilled
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.760]   at getting to that, tuning into that station.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   I just, I beat my brains out and was unable to do it,
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.320]   you know, except in, because I was sort of trying too hard.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.980]   It was sort of like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.500]   trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.260]   driving you crazy.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.420]   But over time, you know, knock wood,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.420]   I've kind of gotten better at it.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.220]   And I can sort of let go of those,
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.500]   that part of me that's trying so hard.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.500]   And so these angels can speak a little more easily
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.420]   through the membrane.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.780]   - Can you put into words the process of letting go
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.100]   and clearing that channel of communication?
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100]   What does it take?
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.220]   - That's another great question.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.460]   For me, it just took, it took probably 30 years.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.700]   And I don't even, I guess I would liken it to meditation
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.300]   even though I'm not a meditator.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.740]   But it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   in the world to just sit still and stop thinking, right?
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.260]   And so it's very hard to put into words.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.420]   And I think that's why these teachers of meditation
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.900]   use tricks and koans and stuff like that.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.540]   But for me, at least, I think it was just a process
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.940]   of years and years and years of trying
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.580]   and finally of beating my head in the wall
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.860]   and finally little by little giving up
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.140]   the beating of the head.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.020]   But there doesn't seem to be any trick.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.620]   Everybody wants a hack these days.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.340]   And I don't think there is a hack.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:37.380]   If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse,
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.380]   she's watching you down there,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.820]   beating your head in the wall.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.620]   You're like a Marine going through an obstacle course
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.860]   or a martial artist trying to learn,
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   you know, like Uma Thurman doing the casket,
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.340]   you know, trying to make that little four inch punch,
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.180]   you know?
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.620]   The muse or the goddess is just sort of watching going,
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.620]   "Alex, he's trying, he's trying.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.380]   "I'm gonna come back in another couple of months
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.140]   "and see if he's still there."
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   And finally she'll say, "All right, he's had it.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.480]   "He's paid his dues.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.820]   "I'm gonna give it to him."
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.580]   - So the hard work and the suffering, yeah.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.940]   But, you know, I'm also being Russian
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.780]   in wrestling and martial arts.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.140]   We're big into drilling technique.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.260]   I was also just even getting at,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.380]   certainly there's no shortcut.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.100]   But is there a process?
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:28.940]   So you're at,
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.420]   the process of practice.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.660]   So you had two.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.020]   One, you had an example of meditation.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.860]   So it's essentially the practice of meditation.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.700]   Is you--
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.520]   - I think so.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.980]   Well, a drill I think is a good way to look at it too.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.220]   - But what are you drilling?
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   You're just sitting and--
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.780]   - You're writing, you know?
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.620]   - Just writing.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.540]   - You're writing, then you're looking at what you wrote,
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.380]   you know?
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.660]   You're hitting moments when it flows, you know?
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.620]   And then your other hitting moments
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.740]   where you just can't do anything.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.060]   And you're trying to, from the moments where it flowed,
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.520]   you're trying to come back and look at it and say,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.740]   "What did I do?
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.520]   "How did that happen?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.780]   "Where was my mind?"
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   You know?
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.300]   But I think it's just a process of over and over
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.160]   and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.300]   - And did you always, when you read something,
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.660]   when you write, did you always have a pretty good radar
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.160]   for what's good and not after it's written?
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.900]   - No.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:34.940]   (laughing)
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.620]   I think I do now, but no.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:44.360]   It was always really hard for me to know what was good.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.060]   - I mean, do you edit?
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.900]   The process of editing is the process of looking
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.100]   at what you've written and improving it.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.420]   Are you a better writer or an editor?
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.740]   How often do you edit?
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.260]   - That's another great question.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.940]   Great question, 'cause I do think that in writing,
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.700]   the real process of looking at it
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.940]   is the process that an editor does,
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.060]   rather than what a writer does.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.380]   The gentleman I was just talking to on the phone
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.080]   is my editor, Sean Coyne, who was the guy
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.580]   who bought "Gates of Fire" when he was an editor
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.460]   at Doubleday, and who, basically,
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.180]   when I finish a book, I give it to him.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.820]   And he gives me, you know, he,
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.540]   editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.180]   It really means looking at the overall work
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.340]   and saying, does it work?
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.060]   And if it doesn't work, why doesn't it work?
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.980]   Is there something wrong here?
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.540]   You know, like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge,
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.580]   you know, and one span was out of whack, you know,
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.260]   you could, and I think a really skilled editor,
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.860]   which Sean is, understands what makes a story tick,
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.220]   and he also has the perspective that I've lost
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.060]   in something I've wrote, 'cause I'm so close to it,
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:06.020]   to say, you know, this isn't working, and that is working.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.700]   - What kind of advice has he given you?
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   Is it like layout, like this story doesn't flow correctly,
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.180]   like you shouldn't start at this point,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.380]   or does he even sit back at a higher level and say,
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.460]   I see what you're doing, but you could do better?
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.380]   - No, he doesn't do that.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.220]   - Okay.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.180]   - But a lot of it is about genre,
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.620]   and kind of defining what genre you're working in,
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.100]   and I'm gonna get up here to just bring something over here
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:37.940]   for the camera.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:42.540]   This was one where Sean tore this down
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   and made me start from scratch,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.820]   and what the specifics of it were really,
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.380]   this is a supernatural thriller, that's the genre,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.980]   sort of like "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist,"
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.460]   and what he showed me was that I had violated
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.540]   certain conventions of the genre,
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:09.440]   and you just can't do that, it's gotta be,
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.700]   you know, it has to be done the right way,
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.540]   and so he pointed out certain things to me.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:22.060]   - Um, so he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   That's such a tough job of editor.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.620]   - Yeah, again, he was sort of born to do that,
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.540]   he just kind of glommed onto it,
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:36.900]   but since he was, his first job publishing, you know,
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:42.820]   cat thrillers, you know, cat detective books,
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.300]   you know, he studied how it works,
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.140]   what makes a story work, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.020]   and so he really, he's great,
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.380]   and I think any really successful writer,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:55.380]   unless they're utterly brilliant on their own,
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.820]   has gotta have a great editor behind them.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.140]   - But you yourself edit as well.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.020]   - I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.660]   Everything you see in my blog posts
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.500]   that is about the craft of writing
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.940]   is me trying to teach myself the rules,
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.700]   so that, you know, I'm sure it's the same in martial arts
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:16.940]   or anything else, right?
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.800]   You try to not be dependent on that other person,
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.340]   'cause it's so painful to make those mistakes.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.060]   You really feel like, "God, I wish I could get it right
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.140]   "the first time, the next time I do it."
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.060]   - Well, in research, we go through that.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.140]   In research, more than writing,
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.800]   so what you do is a little more solitary.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.340]   In research, there's usually two, three, four people
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.240]   working on something together, and we write a paper,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   and there's that painful process of where you write it down
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.460]   and then you share it with other,
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.980]   and not only do they criticize the writing,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.420]   they criticize the fundamental aspects
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.960]   of the approach you've taken.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.800]   - I would think so.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.020]   So it's exactly like, you know, they would say,
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.300]   you're attacking, you're asking the wrong questions, right?
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.140]   - The wrong questions, yeah,
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.700]   and that's extremely painful, especially when you,
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.260]   well, it's painful and helpful,
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.520]   but there's disagreement and so on,
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.620]   and through that comes out a better product in the end.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.680]   If, 'cause you want to still have an ego,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.960]   but you also wanna silence it every once in a while
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.880]   so there's a balance.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.480]   In your book, The War of Art,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.720]   you talk about resistance with a capital R,
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.880]   as the invisible force in this universe of ours
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.400]   that finds a way to prevent you
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.460]   from starting or doing the work.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:39.120]   Where do you think resistance comes from?
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.840]   Why is there a force in our mind
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.060]   that's constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.600]   with laziness, excuses, and so on?
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.300]   - That's another great question.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:53.180]   I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.440]   it's called the yetzir hara, right?
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.480]   And it's a force that if this up here
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.600]   is your soul of Neshamah trying to talk to you,
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.920]   us down here, the yetzir hara
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.000]   is this negative force in the middle.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.520]   So I'm not the only one that ever thought about this,
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   but, and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.000]   but here's my answer.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.380]   I think that there are two places
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.600]   where we as human beings can seat our identity.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.880]   One is the ego, the conscious ego,
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.440]   and the other is the greater self.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.200]   And the self in the Jungian sense,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.640]   the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.400]   and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.560]   which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.360]   And I think, and the ego is just this little dot
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.480]   inside this bigger self.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   And the ego has a completely different view of life
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.680]   as from the self.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.960]   The ego believes, I'm gonna give you a long answer here.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.920]   - No, perfect.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.300]   - The ego believes that death is real.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.200]   The ego believes that time and space are real.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.960]   The ego believes that each one of us
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.840]   is separate from the other.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.240]   I'm separate from you.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.400]   I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.200]   It would only hurt you.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear,
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.480]   because we are all made of flesh.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.320]   We can all die.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.160]   We can all be hurt.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.840]   We can all be ruined, bump, and a bump.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.960]   So we are protecting ourselves and even our desire to create
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.400]   as we were talking about before
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.000]   comes out of that fear of death.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.840]   The self, on the other hand, the greater self
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.000]   that butts up against the divine ground,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.520]   believes that death is not real,
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.000]   that time and space are not real,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.480]   that the gods travel swift as thought.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.640]   And the ego also believes that, I mean,
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.920]   the self believes that there's no difference
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.480]   between you and me, that we're all one.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.080]   If I hurt you, I hurt myself, karma, right?
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.660]   And in the world of the self, of the greater self,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.300]   the dominant emotion is love, not fear.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.800]   Now, so I think that, let me, I'll go farther back here.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.000]   I'll try a long way to answer your question.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.560]   When Jesus died on the cross,
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.920]   or when the 300 Spartans
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.120]   willingly sacrificed their lives at Thermopylae,
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.560]   they were acting according to the rules of the self.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.360]   Death is not real, no difference between you and me,
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.000]   time and space are not real, predominant emotion is love.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   So, in my opinion, we as conscious human vessels
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.560]   have, are in a struggle between these two things,
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.160]   the ego and the self.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.920]   To me, resistance is the voice of the ego,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.580]   saying, and it's a fearful voice,
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:00.480]   because if, when we identify with the self,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.080]   we move our consciousness over to the self,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.620]   as artists or scientists,
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.040]   opening ourselves up to the cosmic dimension,
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.920]   to the other forces,
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.320]   the ego is tremendously threatened by that,
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:18.280]   because if we're in that space, that head space,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.480]   we don't need the ego anymore.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.960]   So I think resistance is a voice of the ego
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.280]   trying to keep control of us.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.560]   In a way, I'll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.880]   - That's probably a very good example, right?
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.840]   - You know, it's a zero-sum world for him,
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.360]   and for anybody that's in that,
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.980]   and the opposite of that would be somebody
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.540]   like Martin Luther King or Gandhi,
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.420]   and that's of course why they all wind up
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.360]   getting assassinated, because that voice,
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.280]   that ego is hanging on to itself,
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.080]   and feels so threatened by,
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.720]   I could talk more about this if you want.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.160]   - No, for sure, that's fascinating,
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.360]   it's just, it's interesting why the fear
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.960]   is attached to the ego.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.260]   I really like this dichotomy of ego and self
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.120]   and that struggle.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.760]   It's just, ego has a, you know,
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.560]   the self-obsession of it,
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.400]   why fear is such a predominant thing,
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:29.140]   why is resistance trying to undermine everything?
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.040]   - It's fear, it's out of fear.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.800]   Let's think about the whole thing in terms of stories.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.880]   In a story, the villain is always resistance,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.960]   is always the ego.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   The hero is always, of course always is not everything,
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.600]   but you know what I mean, pretty much,
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   represents kind of the self.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.680]   If you think about the alien on the spaceship,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.360]   that's like the ultimate kind of villain,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.240]   it keeps changing form, right?
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.000]   First it goes on the guy's face,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.860]   then it pops out of his chest,
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.360]   but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.760]   to destroy, you know?
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.600]   And just like the ego, just like resistance.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.560]   And maybe alien is a bad example,
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.680]   because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.880]   on the same terms as the alien,
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.160]   but maybe a better example might be
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.800]   something like "Casablanca",
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.920]   where in the end, the Humphrey Bogart character
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.520]   has to acting, operating out of the self,
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.360]   has to give up his selfish dream
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.520]   of going off with Ingrid Bergman,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.480]   Neil Salon, the love of his life,
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.320]   and instead, puts her on a plane to Lisbon,
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.400]   while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.120]   I don't know if that's clear,
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.880]   but in almost every story,
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.440]   the villain is the ego, is resistance, is fear,
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.840]   is that zero-sum thing.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.480]   And in almost every story, the hero is someone
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   that is willing to make a sacrifice to help others.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.680]   - It's letting go of that fear
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.960]   is what leads to productivity and to success.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.800]   - Yeah.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.480]   - Do you think there's a,
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.880]   this is probably the answer is either obvious or impossible,
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.760]   but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.400]   to resistance?
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.800]   Like what would life look like without resistance?
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.400]   - That's another great question.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.200]   I think, I also believe that resistance, like death,
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.760]   gives a meaning to life.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:49.480]   If we didn't have it, it's gonna be, what would we be?
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.040]   We'd be in the Garden of Eden,
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.600]   picking fruit and just happy and stupid.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.880]   And I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.840]   is really about this kind of thing,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.680]   where Adam and Eve decide to sort of take matters
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   into their own hands and acquire knowledge,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.200]   that until then, God had said,
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.640]   "I'm the only one that's got that knowledge."
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.960]   And of course, once they've acquired that knowledge,
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.560]   they're cast out into the world you and I live in now,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.280]   where they do have to deal with that fear
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.920]   and they do have to deal with all that stuff.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.800]   It's the human condition.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.960]   - It's the human condition, and the meaning
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   and the purpose comes from the resistance being there
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.560]   and the struggle to overcome it.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.960]   - To overcome it, right.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.400]   And also, the other aspect of it is that
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.240]   it's not real at all.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   It's not even like it's an actual force.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.560]   It's all here, right?
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   So the sort of, in a way, it's sort of a surrender to it.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   - Yeah, surrender to its reality.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.000]   - Sort of like turning on the light in a dark thing.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.120]   It's like, it's gone.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.160]   - But not quite, because it's never really--
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.280]   - Not quite, 'cause it comes back again tomorrow morning.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.840]   So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.840]   So what's been, maybe recently, but in general,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.200]   maybe in your life, what's been the most relentless
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.840]   or one of the more relentless sources of resistance
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.240]   to you personally?
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.640]   - I mean, it's always the same.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.320]   It's about writing, for me,
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.680]   and evolving within my own body of work.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.440]   It never goes away, it never gets any less.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.240]   - Do you have particular excuses,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.520]   particular justifications that come out?
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.200]   - No, it's always the same.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.880]   Well, I would say it's always the same,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.320]   but it's really not because resistance is so protean.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.040]   It keeps changing form.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.200]   And as you move to, hopefully, a higher level,
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.080]   resistance gets a little more nuanced
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.880]   and a little more subtle, trying to fake you out.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.040]   But I think you learn that it's always there
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.440]   and you're always gonna have to face it.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.840]   - I mean, your battle is sitting down
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.000]   and writing to some number of words to a blank page.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.120]   Do you have a process there with this battle?
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.600]   Do you have a number of hours that you put in?
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.440]   Do you sit down?
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.000]   - Yeah, I'm definitely a believer
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.560]   that even though this battle is fought
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.140]   on the highest sort of spiritual level,
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.160]   that the way you fight it is on the most mundane,
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.920]   I'm sure it's like martial arts must be the same way.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.080]   I mean, I go to the gym first thing in the morning
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.280]   and I sort of am rehearsing myself.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   The gym is called resistance training, right?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.280]   You're working against resistance, right?
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.680]   And I don't wanna go, I don't wanna get out of bed.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.780]   I hate that, you know?
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:09.480]   But I'm sort of fortifying myself to be ready for the day.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.800]   And like I said, over Knockwood, over years,
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.160]   I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.400]   and it's not as hard for me as it used to be.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.200]   The real resistance I think for me,
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.600]   and I think this is true for anybody,
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.900]   is the question of sort of what's the next idea?
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.120]   What's the next book?
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.520]   What's the next project that you're gonna work on?
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.860]   And when I ask that question, I'm asking it of the muse.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.040]   I'm kind of saying, what do you want me,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.460]   or I'm asking it of my unconscious.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.280]   If we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums,
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.080]   it's kind of, well, what's the next album?
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.440]   Now he's on Broadway.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.040]   That was a great idea, right?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.040]   - Yeah, that was a great idea.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.840]   - Where'd that come from, you know?
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.920]   And then for him, what's after that?
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.800]   Because that body of work is already alive.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.080]   It already exists inside us,
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.520]   kind of like a woman's biological clock.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.420]   And we have to serve it.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.020]   And we have to, otherwise it'll give us cancer.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.520]   I don't mean to say that if anybody has cancer,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.280]   that they're not, but you know what I mean.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.120]   It'll take its revenge on us.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.360]   So the next resistance to me is sort of,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.520]   or a big aspect of it is, what's next?
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.840]   When I finish the book I'm working on now,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.840]   I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.240]   - But see, at the same time, you have a kind of,
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:42.720]   you have a sense that there is a Bruce Springsteen
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.040]   single line of albums.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.480]   So it's already known somewhere in the universe
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.960]   what you're going to do next, is the sense you have.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.520]   - In a sense, yes.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.960]   I don't know if it's predetermined, you know?
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.460]   But there's something like that.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:03.440]   - Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's,
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.480]   well, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.040]   Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.600]   it's one thing for sure.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.560]   It was always going to be that one thing.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.280]   But really, in reality, it's a distribution.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.800]   It could be any number of things.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.640]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.840]   There's alternate realities.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.120]   - Alternate realities, yeah.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.480]   - But they're not that far apart.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.320]   I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.640]   a Joni Mitchell song, you know?
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.480]   No matter how hard he tries.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.880]   - He still went on Broadway, I mean, he still did that,
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.360]   which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.000]   So I think you're being, in retrospect,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.840]   it all makes sense. - I think it is
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.880]   a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.780]   It's a next sort of evolution for him.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.880]   Why not take his music to there, you know?
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.400]   - In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.440]   - Yeah.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.080]   - If you pull it off, especially.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.600]   Do you visualize yourself completing the work?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.140]   Like Olympic athletes visualize getting the gold medal.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:06.080]   Do you, you know, they go through,
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.240]   I mean, that's actually a really,
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.960]   you can learn something from athletes on that,
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   'cause years out, certainly two, three years out,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.660]   some people do much longer, every day,
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:22.300]   you visualize how the day of the championship will go,
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.660]   the down to, I mean, everything,
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.900]   down to how will it feel to stand on the podium and so on.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.220]   Do you do anything like that in how you approach writing?
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.260]   - No.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.580]   - It's always in the moment.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.700]   - Because, yeah, it is in the moment, I think.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.620]   Because it's such a mystery, you just don't know.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.260]   I think it's different from sports.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.700]   - Right.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:41.700]   'Cause you don't know the destiny.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.700]   There's no gold medal at the end.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:48.060]   - No, in fact, I would like to think
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.320]   that as soon as you finish one,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.620]   the next day, you're on the other.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.500]   And in fact, hopefully, you've already started the other.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.920]   You're already, you know, 100 pages into the other
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.260]   when you finish the first one.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.900]   But it is a,
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.100]   it's a journey, it's a process.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.940]   I don't think it is a, in fact,
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.260]   I think it's very dangerous to think that way.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:20.700]   To think, oh, this, I'm gonna win the Oscar, you know?
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.980]   - It's interesting.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.400]   For the creative process, it might be dangerous.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.120]   Maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous?
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.820]   Because I kind of know where you're going--
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.300]   - 'Cause it's the ego.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.140]   - It's the ego.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.060]   - Because you're giving yourself over to the ego.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.780]   You know, I keep saying this myself.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.660]   My job, I'm a servant of the muse.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.900]   I'm there to do what she tells me to do.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.300]   And if I suddenly think, oh, I'm really,
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.180]   I just wanna, you know, whatever,
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.780]   the muse doesn't like that.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.300]   And, you know?
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.760]   And she's on another dimension for me.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:01.320]   - I'm trying to square that, 'cause I agree.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.060]   I'm trying to square that with the,
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.980]   I think there's a meditation to visualizing success
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:12.900]   in the athletic realm, to where it focuses,
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.580]   it removes everything else away,
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.260]   to where you focus on this particular battle.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   I mean, I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:28.700]   And in sports, the ego serves a more important role,
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:31.660]   I think, than it does in writing.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.940]   Any of the ego, there's something--
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.020]   - Well, let me, when you say that,
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.300]   I know what you mean, Lex.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.260]   And I do think there is a sort of a,
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.260]   you know, it's interesting to watch interviews
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.060]   with Steph Curry, who's such, obviously such a nice guy,
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:54.100]   but he's got such tremendous self-confidence,
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:58.540]   but it doesn't border on ego so much,
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.140]   because he's worked so hard for it, you know?
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.500]   But he knows, so he has visualized.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.260]   He has visualized maybe not so much winning,
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:11.820]   as just him being the best he can be,
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.780]   him being in the flow, doing his thing
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.100]   that he knows he can do.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.320]   And I do think in the creative world,
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.220]   yeah, there is a sort of a thing like that,
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:28.220]   where you, where a choreographer or a filmmaker
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.940]   or whatever might be, do an internal thing
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.020]   where they're saying, I can make an Oscar-winning movie,
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.100]   I can direct this movie, you know?
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.060]   I'm banishing these thoughts that I'm not good enough.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.420]   I can do that, I can edit it, I can score it,
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.540]   I can, you know, bumpity-bumpity-bump.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.420]   But, and I don't think that's really ego.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.620]   I think that's part of the process in a good way,
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.220]   like an athlete does that.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.420]   - So, extreme confidence is what some
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.580]   of the best athletes come with.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.940]   And you think it's possible to, as a writer,
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.780]   to have extreme confidence in yourself?
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.700]   - I do think so.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:09.900]   You know, that I'm sure when John Lennon sat down
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:14.300]   to write a song, he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know?
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.060]   - I'm not so sure.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.140]   I think, 'cause the great artists I've seen,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.380]   you're haunted by self-doubt.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:26.060]   It's that resistance, I mean, the confidence--
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.100]   - Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even beyond the self,
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.980]   within the self, above the self-doubt--
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.580]   - Oh, it's the bigger picture of the self.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.940]   - Is self-belief, you know?
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.900]   Yeah, I'm freaking out, yeah, I'm worried
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]   that I'm not gonna be able to do it,
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.500]   but you know, I know, I can do this.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.580]   - Yeah, and when you look at,
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.940]   when you take a bigger picture view of it.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:46.940]   So, the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely?
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:53.620]   - No, because you're with your characters.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.100]   You are.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.380]   - So, you really put yourself in the world.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.460]   - Absolutely, you know, I've written about this before,
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.780]   that I used to, my desk used to face a wall,
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.500]   instead of seeing, and people would say,
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.380]   well, don't you wanna look out the window?
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.740]   But I'm in here, I'm seeing the Spartans,
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.740]   I'm seeing whatever, and the characters that are on the page,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.360]   or that you create, are not accidents, you know?
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.860]   They're coming out of some issue,
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.340]   some deep issue that you have,
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.420]   whether you realize it or not.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.300]   You might not realize it 'til 20 years later,
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.940]   or somebody explains it to you.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.220]   So, your characters are kind of fascinating to you,
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.380]   and their dilemmas are fascinating to you,
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.860]   and you're also trying to come to grips with them,
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.340]   you know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly,
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.140]   you know, and you really wanna see them more clearly.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.300]   So, yeah, no, it's not lonely at all.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.200]   In fact, I'm more lonely sometimes later,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.660]   going out to dinner with some people,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.220]   and actually talking to people.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.540]   - Do you miss the characters after it's over?
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.340]   - Let's say I have affection for them,
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.240]   kind of like children that have gone off to college,
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.500]   and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.160]   Definitely, I have affection for them.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.680]   Even the bad guys.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.860]   (laughing)
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.500]   - Maybe especially the bad guys?
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.800]   - Especially the bad guys.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:29.100]   - You've said that writers, even successful writers,
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.340]   are often not tough-minded enough.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.540]   I've read that in a post,
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.820]   that you have to be a professional
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.460]   in the way you handle your emotions.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.740]   You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   So, what are, what do you think makes a warrior?
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.580]   Is a warrior born or trained in the realm,
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.780]   in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing,
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.100]   in the creative process?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.580]   - I think they're born to some extent.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.840]   You have the gift, like you might have the gift
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.820]   as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:05.140]   But the training is the big thing.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:09.100]   90% training, 10% genetics.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:13.740]   And, you know, I use another analogy, other than warrior,
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.580]   as far as writer, and that's like to be a mother.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.220]   If you think about, if you're a writer,
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.420]   or any creative person, you're giving birth to something,
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.860]   right, you're carrying a new life inside you.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.860]   And in terms of bravery, if your child,
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.140]   your two-year-old child is underneath a car,
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.580]   is coming down the street,
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.780]   the mother's gonna like stop a Buick,
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.900]   you know, with her bare hands.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.220]   So that's another way to think about
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.380]   how a writer has to think about,
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.060]   or any creative person has to think about, I think,
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.460]   what they're doing, what this child,
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.760]   this new creation that they're bringing forth.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.100]   - Yeah, so the hard work that's underlying that.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.760]   I've just, a couple weeks ago, talked to,
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.860]   just happened to be in the same room,
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.940]   both gave talks, Arianna Huffington.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.900]   I did this conversation with her.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:11.100]   I didn't know much about her before then,
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:14.420]   but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books,
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.220]   and been promoting a lifestyle where,
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.260]   she basically, she created the Huffington Post,
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.180]   and she gave herself, like, I don't know,
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.620]   20 hours a day, just obsessed with her work.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.300]   And then she fainted, passed out,
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.660]   and kind of, there was some health issues.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.180]   And so she wrote this book saying that, you know, sleep,
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.900]   basically you wanna establish a lifestyle
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:41.360]   that doesn't sacrifice health,
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.500]   that's productive but doesn't sacrifice health.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.420]   She thinks that you can have both, productivity and health.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.860]   Criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spoken with,
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.700]   for working too hard, and thereby sacrificing,
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:59.420]   you know, being less effective than he could be.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:02.100]   So I'm trying to get at this balance
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:06.820]   between health and obsessively working at something,
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.100]   and really working hard.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.140]   So what Arianna is talking about makes sense to me,
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.580]   but I'm a little bit torn.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:17.140]   To me, passion and reason do not overlap much,
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.140]   or at all, sometimes.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.880]   Maybe I'm being too Russian, but.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.980]   (laughing)
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:26.340]   I feel madness and obsession does not care for health,
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.620]   or sleep, or diet, or any of that.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.860]   And hard work is hard work,
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.200]   and everything else can go to hell.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.420]   So if you're really focused on, whether it's writing a book,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.860]   it should, everything should just go to hell.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.140]   Where do you stand on this balance?
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.300]   How important is health for productivity?
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.340]   How important is it to sort of get sleep, and so on?
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.360]   - I'm on the health side.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.440]   I mean, there was a period of my life when I was just,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.900]   I had no obligations, and I was just living
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:05.340]   in a little house, and just working nonstop, you know?
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.260]   But even then, I would get up in the morning,
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.460]   and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.780]   Every day, and I would do my exercise, whatever it was.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.820]   But although I was still doing 18 hours a day.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.420]   But I'm definitely, I kind of think of it
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.180]   sort of like an athlete does.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:27.180]   I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.980]   to winning championships and stuff like that.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.180]   But he has his family, he sees his family,
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.740]   family is always there.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.740]   He, I'm sure he eats perfect, great stuff,
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   gets his sleep, you know, gets the train,
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:45.900]   whatever a trainer does to him for his knees
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.340]   and his ankles and whatever.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:51.180]   So, or Kobe Bryant or anybody that's operating
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.620]   at a high level.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.040]   So I do think I'm from that kind of the health school.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.520]   The good thing about being a writer
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.860]   is you can't work very many hours a day.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.860]   You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.600]   I've never been able to work more than that.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.860]   I don't know how people do it.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:11.220]   I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how they do it.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.700]   So that gives you a lot of other time to do it.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.220]   - Optimize your health.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.060]   - Yeah, to optimize your health.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.780]   'Cause you need to, you're in training.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.300]   You know, you're really, you're burning up
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.500]   a lot of B vitamins when you're working here.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.540]   (laughing)
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.480]   - Yeah, but.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.860]   - Maybe it's a Russian thing with you, Lex.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:29.900]   - Well, it's not even a Russian thing.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.740]   I mean--
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.260]   - It also may be youth, you know?
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:35.420]   At 35, you can be crazy.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.060]   - You know, that's what they keep telling me,
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:43.060]   but I'm pretty sure I'll be at it still at a later time, too.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:47.100]   I think it has to do with the career choice, too.
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.540]   I think writing is almost, from everything I've heard,
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:54.740]   it's almost impossible to do more than a few hours
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.340]   really well.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:58.780]   The, when you start to get into certain disciplines,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:02.620]   like with Elon Musk and me, engineering disciplines,
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:07.620]   that really there's a lot more non-muse time needed.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.100]   - Right, right, right.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.620]   - So the crazy hours that you're talking,
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:18.620]   that you often are talking about have to be done.
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.060]   And it doesn't--
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.100]   - I think that's true.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.900]   - Yeah, so there's still the two, three hours of muse time
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.680]   needed for truly genius ideas,
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.660]   but it's something I certainly struggle with.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.300]   But yeah, I hear you loud and clear on the health.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:44.220]   So what does a perfect day look like for you
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.740]   if we're talking about writing?
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.200]   An hour by hour schedule of a perfect day.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.380]   - I get up early, I go to the gym,
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:57.380]   I have breakfast with some friends of mine.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.660]   - What's early, by the way?
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.340]   That's, like, how early?
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.180]   - 3.15.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.860]   - AM. - AM.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.340]   - So we're talking really early.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.220]   - Really early.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.020]   Now, I'm crazy early, it's ridiculously early.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.940]   But, and I haven't done that always,
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.740]   but that's kind of what I'm on now.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:19.180]   So I'm in bed, like, when I'm with my nephews
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.260]   that are, like, four years old and three years old,
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.700]   I'm in bed before them.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.180]   - Okay, you gotta be, you wake up,
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.380]   sorry, you said exercise first.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.700]   - Yeah.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.820]   - And what does that look like?
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.180]   What's exercise for you?
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.020]   You go out to the gym?
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:33.840]   - I go to the gym.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.420]   I have a trainer, I have a couple of guys
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.020]   that I work out with, and I'll, you know,
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.180]   it's maybe an hour, maybe a little more.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.660]   I'll do a little warmup before, stretching afterwards,
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.400]   take a shower, go have breakfast.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.660]   But it's an intense kind of a thing
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.860]   that I definitely don't wanna do that's hard, you know?
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.500]   - So you feel like you've accomplished something,
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.020]   first thing. - Yeah.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.860]   - That's a big accomplishment of the day.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.540]   - But at the same time, it's not, like, so hard
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.940]   that I'm completely exhausted, you know?
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:10.100]   And then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.580]   and stuff has to be done, and then I work
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:15.580]   for maybe three hours, and then I just sort of crash.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.900]   The office is closed, I turn the switch,
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.360]   I don't think about anything, I don't think about the work
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.380]   at all.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.660]   - Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards?
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.620]   - After work, once the office is closed.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:31.020]   - But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing?
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:33.540]   - Something like that, yeah. - Something like that, okay.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.980]   Do you listen to music? - No.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.060]   - Do you have anything? - But that's just me.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.340]   I mean, I don't think, you know, but somebody could do it
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.500]   a million different ways. - It's fascinating.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   It's fascinating, you know, the, I mean, you've also,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.880]   of most, of many writers, you've really,
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.900]   but like I've read Stephen King's writing,
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.180]   you've optimized this conversation
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.420]   with the muse you're having.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.700]   Not optimized, but you've at least thought about it.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.660]   So what's, can you say a little bit more
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:06.240]   about the trivialities of that process of,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.660]   like you said, facing the wall?
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.300]   What's, do you have little rituals?
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   - You mean like the granular aspect of it?
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.000]   - The granular aspects, yeah.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.660]   Is there-- - I do have little rituals.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.300]   I do have all kinds of, which I'm not even
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:23.700]   gonna tell you about. - Sure.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:28.700]   - But the one thing, and I don't wanna like
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.340]   talk about this too much 'cause it sort of
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.020]   jinxes things, I think, but the one thing
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.140]   I do try to do is when I sit down,
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.060]   I immediately get into it, first second.
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.700]   I don't sit and fuck around with anything.
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.300]   I immediately try to get into it as quickly as I can.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.740]   The other thing is that writing a book or screenplay
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:54.060]   or anything like that is a process of multiple drafts.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:57.580]   And it's the first draft that's where you're most
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.660]   with the muse, where you're going through the blank page.
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.900]   Like right now, I'm on, I don't know what,
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.940]   the fifth or sixth, seventh draft of the thing
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.340]   I'm working on, so I've got pages already written.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.180]   And I'm kind of reading them afresh
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.860]   as I go through the story.
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:17.500]   So it's not quite where I am now.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:21.060]   It's not quite a deep muse scenario.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.940]   Partly it is, but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.580]   between the right brain and the left brain.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.660]   I'm kind of looking at it and trying to evaluate it.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.780]   Then I'm going into it and try to change it a little bit.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:38.660]   - Do you know, sit down, get right into it,
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:43.620]   do you know the night before of what that starting point is?
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:47.020]   - I always try to stop, and I learned this,
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.300]   I think Hemingway wrote about this, or John Steinbeck,
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.580]   or maybe both of them, to always stop
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.820]   when you kind of know what's coming next,
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:58.260]   so that you're not at a, facing a chasm, you know?
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:02.300]   - Yeah, okay, so and afterwards, when you're done,
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.420]   the office is closed.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.300]   - The office is closed, I let the muse take care of it,
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.420]   you know, and I don't want to,
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.780]   and I think it's a very unhealthy thing
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:13.420]   to worry about it or think about any creative process.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.740]   You don't, like on a long walk later, think about--
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:22.260]   - Yeah, then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.380]   but I won't be like obsessing about it.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:25.220]   - Right, okay.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.740]   - 'Cause actually on walks,
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.380]   sometimes things will pop into your head, you know,
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.380]   and you'll go, oh, I should change that.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.280]   But that's not your ego doing it, that's a deeper level.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.620]   - Okay, so how does the day end?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.820]   So go-- - In terms of writing?
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.120]   - So yeah, the writing, well no, the writing,
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.100]   the office door closes, and then the rest of the day,
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.540]   just do whatever the hell.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:52.460]   - Maybe go out to dinner, my girlfriend is not here now,
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.100]   she's in New York working, we'll make dinner or whatever,
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.420]   go out to dinner, something like that,
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:01.300]   and maybe I'll read something, nothing heavy.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.700]   And I go to bed pretty early,
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.300]   and the gym is a big thing for me.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.500]   I'll already, probably like with you with martial arts,
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.700]   the night before I'll be visualizing
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.380]   what I have to do the next day,
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.060]   and getting myself psyched up for that.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.180]   And then I'll just conk out like a light
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.380]   and wake up at the crack of dawn.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.140]   - So looking out into the future,
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.960]   this year, next few years,
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.360]   what do you think the muse has in store for you?
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.660]   - I don't think you can ever know.
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:40.080]   It's probably something along the same,
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.780]   I really believe there's that exercise
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.820]   where they say to you,
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.220]   visualize yourself five years in the future,
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.860]   and write a letter from that person to yourself.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.340]   I don't believe in that at all,
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.500]   because I don't think you can,
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.980]   there's a line out of Africa that,
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:24:59.380]   God made the world round
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.920]   so that we couldn't see too far ahead.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.860]   You just don't know as a writer or as a person.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.180]   I never knew, my first book was "A Legend of Bagger Vance".
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:15.920]   Before that happened, I had no clue
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.880]   that I was gonna be writing anything like that
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.640]   on that subject, anything at all,
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.240]   no clue until it just sort of came.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.440]   And then when that was done,
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.760]   people said, "Well, you gotta write another one."
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.200]   I had no idea what it was,
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.880]   which was gonna be "Gates of Fire".
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.160]   No clue.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.640]   So if somebody had sat me down at the start of that
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.000]   and asked the question,
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.660]   I would have been crazy to say it.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:44.100]   So I just hope, as the future unfolds,
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.420]   that I'm open to it, you know?
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.380]   - Well, I think I speak for a lot of people
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.220]   in saying that we look forward to
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.780]   what that future looks like.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.460]   Steven, thank you so much for talking today.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.380]   It was fun. - Hey, it's a great,
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.720]   you got the best job in the world
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.900]   going around talking to people that you wanna talk to
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.220]   and that they will talk to you, you know?
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.300]   - So thank you for doing it.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.720]   - Hey, thank you for the great questions.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.560]   You made me think.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.820]   I've certainly a bunch of questions
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.980]   I never have answered before.

[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.040]   from Steven Pressfield.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.160]   Are you paralyzed by fear?
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.640]   That's a good sign.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.860]   Fear is good.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.940]   Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.840]   Fear tells us what we have to do.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.820]   Remember one rule of thumb.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:12.280]   The more scared we are of a work or a calling,
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.300]   the more sure we can be that we have to do it.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.940]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.100]   (upbeat music)
