[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm thrilled to have you on my journey to optimize my
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   life, and I couldn't be more excited for the conversation I'm about to have
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   with Stephanie O'Connell Rodriguez.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   She's the author of The Broken Beautiful Life.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.760]   She's the founder of Statement Event and Statement Cards, and the host of
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.120]   the incredible podcast, Money Confidential.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.000]   She has a wealth of knowledge about finance, and her work has been featured
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.640]   in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and she's appeared as an
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.640]   expert on ABC World News, Bloomberg, and so many more places.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480]   In our conversation, we'll talk about some great hacks for expensive cities,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.520]   whether you live there or just visiting.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.720]   We'll talk about some of the ways we've tried to change things up around the
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.520]   holidays for gifting, both to save money and to get back to the true spirit of
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.080]   giving, and we'll dive into some fascinating things Stephanie's been
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.320]   learning about money from the first season of her podcast, where she's gone
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   deep to solve some real money issues for her listeners.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   All right, let's jump in.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Stephanie, thanks for being here.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.800]   Oh man, it's been a long time coming.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   I know.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.280]   So we met in 2018, and I've only really known you as a money person.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520]   This is kind of what you've been doing.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   But as I researched this podcast, I realized you did not grow up and start
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.800]   your professional career with the aspiration of being a financial expert.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   So I would love to understand how you went from, you know, I'll let you tell
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.200]   the story, but to becoming this financial expert.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   Yeah, like you said, talking about money for a living was the farthest thing from
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.240]   my mind as a young teenager millennial with a lot of dreams in the nineties.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.600]   Right.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   So I went to college with the aspiration that I was going to be a Broadway
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.760]   performer, and it was so much of that narrative of like, you know, pursue your
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.680]   dreams, follow your passion, and everything's going to work itself out.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   You know, this naive notion that we all had growing up a little bit like American
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.800]   dream for the millennial generation, and then I actually did work in the arts for
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   about five to seven years full time.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   And when I say full time, you know, I made money performing, but I also, you
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.760]   know, waited tables.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   I was a personal assistant.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.160]   I basically did anything I could do to make money in legitimate ways in between
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   my jobs, because I would go out and I'd be on a tour for like a year.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   And I was always interested in the money aspect of it, the money making aspect of
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.640]   it.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.400]   And I would just squirrel away everything I earned and we would get per diem.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.800]   And I'd be like, Ooh, this is not taxable income.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920]   Let me save as much of this as I can.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.680]   And then I would come home and be like, I can't bear to spend any of this money I
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   just made.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.200]   It took so much work.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   Let me go find all of these side hustles.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   And basically the reason I got into money was that cycle was completely
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   unsustainable. It was exhausting.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   I was tired of making very little.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.720]   I was just feeling like I was never going to get ahead.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.480]   One of the big turning points for me was having an accident with no, not an
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.960]   accident, an incident with my teeth.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.360]   It's like, oh, you go to the dentist one day and then they're like, you need to
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.760]   have a dental implant.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   That's going to cost two thousand dollars.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.600]   And I just sobbed.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.400]   I sobbed in the dentist's chair in front of the dentist like a lunatic because I
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   couldn't fathom where that money was going to come from.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.400]   And I was like, this is the worst feeling.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.560]   I am totally at the mercy of the money that I do not have and I do not like it.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.200]   And I want this to change.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.600]   And that got me very into personal finance, like the nerd that I have become with my
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.040]   spreadsheets and my personal finance books and now eventually into a career where I
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.280]   cover personal finance full time.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   And one thing you didn't mention is that all of this was happening in New York City,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.120]   not not the cheapest city in the country or the world, probably one of the most
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.920]   expensive. I think this is the hard thing about a lot of low paying careers is that
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.720]   they're centered in very expensive cities.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   So think about the arts, right?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.120]   It's New York or L.A., generally speaking.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.240]   If you think about fashion, if you think about PR, even these are careers that are
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   very notoriously poorly paying in some of the most expensive places in the world.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.280]   And so what I did find to be really helpful was that I wasn't alone in my pursuit of
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.760]   trying to make it and actually leaning on community of people who are similarly not
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.840]   making a lot of money in these big cities was a huge help because for me, status quo
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.560]   was not having my own apartment in the financial district where it costs three to
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.880]   four thousand dollars a month.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.360]   Status quo was having four roommates and subletting your room whenever you can to
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.160]   make extra money and, you know, splitting things and living out in Inwood or in the
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.200]   Heights or wherever else to cut costs.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   So I think part of it was just having an understanding of what your version of
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.760]   normal is.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.680]   For me, it's been at thirty five.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.640]   I've never lived alone and that's normal.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.600]   And that that perception has saved me a lot of money over time.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah, I started my career in New York as well.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.440]   I had a job that paid more, but not enough to really live that kind of life that you
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.880]   want to live. I actually worked as an intern for the first nine months of my
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   professional post-college career.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.880]   And that's a story for another day.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.520]   But interns don't make the most.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.400]   But what's interesting and I'm curious if you had the same experience is a lot of the
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.760]   things that I did to save money early on living in a city.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.200]   Yes, they were. Some of them are things that I probably don't do anymore, but a lot of
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.320]   them carry through.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.920]   And I think as we've talked over the past few years, I've learned neither one of us
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.840]   wants to have a crappy experience in life.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.240]   Like we want to like do the things you you worked in the arts.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   You want to participate in that.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.160]   You want to go to shows you we both like food.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.680]   I'd love to just dig into some of the things that you did either before or even
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:23.000]   continue to do in a city to make it kind of an amazing experience, but to still spend
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.720]   less money and save more and be really responsible.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.760]   Yeah, as you mentioned, I love to go out.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.280]   I love to see things.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.360]   I love to have really fantastic experiences.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.320]   And the wonderful thing about cities is they are just bastions for free cultural
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.200]   enrichment. And there is just endless calendars of workshops.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.600]   You can go to performances.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.640]   You can go to things you can do that literally cost zero dollars.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.000]   Of course, at this point in my life, I am very happy to pay for these experiences, too.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.840]   But as you mentioned, you know, early on, there just wasn't the money for an
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.520]   entertainment budget, to be honest.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.280]   But what I used to do is I would go to the New York Public Library website where they
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   have a very comprehensive list of all of the events that are coming up and the
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.760]   exhibitions that are coming up and the concerts and talking series, almost all of
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.520]   which are completely free.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   And this is not a New York specific things.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   Almost every town or city has a parks department calendar, has a library calendar,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.760]   has like a chamber of commerce or town calendar where they have so much programming
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   that is either free or low cost or has a lottery system or tickets or things like
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.680]   that. So I was always getting in on whatever was available on those calendars.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.000]   And then I also worked a lot of really cool events.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.480]   So one of my side hustles was just, you know, being a greeter or somebody who's
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.880]   helping distributing materials for a pop up conference or a concert.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.240]   I think I saw A-Rod give a talk during a I don't even know.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.480]   I think it was like a fancy banking event.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   And I was like, OK, I'm going to just stand inside.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.120]   And then at the end, I would be the person who would go pass the mic to people who
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.440]   wanted to ask their questions for him after he was done with his interview.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   So I have found a lot of creative ways to access some of the things that I would never
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.360]   be able to access if I had to pay for it out of my own budget.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.600]   How did you find these side hustles?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.560]   Because I feel like, you know, it's one thing to find a way to make some extra money.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   It's another thing to find a way to make extra money while doing something that you
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.840]   otherwise could never do or like you might not even be able to buy tickets to some of
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.440]   these events or shows, even if you had the money.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.360]   So part of it really is what I was mentioning before about community.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   If you have a lot of people who are in a similar circumstance, you already have a
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.200]   network of people who have a similar need, probably a similar interest and are well
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.480]   connected enough to their own opportunities that that when, you know, another body is
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.080]   needed to cater this event that, I don't know, J-Lo is singing at, like, you can get
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.480]   the call if you're honest and open and vulnerable enough with people to be like,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.880]   "Listen, I need money right now," or "Listen, I'm looking for work."
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.080]   So I think you just honestly need to be upfront about the fact that maybe you do
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.120]   need extra money or you do need side hustles, or maybe you're just interested in
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.160]   certain things so that you become the person people think of and call when those
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.480]   opportunities arise.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.360]   I think the other piece of it is I really leveraged social media, and this is early
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.480]   days. This is, like, I want to say late 2000s, early 2010s.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.440]   And so social media was a little bit different back then, but I remember I would
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.800]   post things on Facebook or I would search Facebook posts and see if people were
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.840]   around in a given city, for example.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.400]   I picked up a babysitting gig once on my day off on a tour because I was searching
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.880]   for friends who live in, I think it was Seattle.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   And I searched that person's posts and the person said, "Oh, my goodness, I'm
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.360]   looking for people who are in the Seattle area and I need them tomorrow for a
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   babysitting gig." And I was like, "I'm on it."
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.480]   And I would also find access to opportunities that way.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.080]   So, you know, when we went to Vegas, I was like, "Hey, I'm headed to Vegas.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   Who do I know?" And somebody was like, "Hey, I work at Cirque du Soleil.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.840]   Do you want free tickets?" So I can be pretty shameless about where I am and
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.960]   what I need. And that has actually served me pretty well.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.480]   That's amazing. I want to come back to one thing that you so briefly mentioned
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.960]   that I took advantage of in New York, which was all the theater lotteries.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:02.040]   So for anyone who doesn't know, almost every stage production, Broadway,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.800]   Off-Broadway, has some system, whether it's a lottery or show up and get
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.520]   standing room only tickets, where for usually, and you are way more connected
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   to the theater industry than me, for 20 or less dollars, you can usually get
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   tickets. Sometimes they're the front two rows.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.840]   I know we've seen Wicked and Book of Mormon and Hamilton and Rent all on
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.640]   lottery tickets where we paid, you know, 20 bucks, 30 bucks and got tickets.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.600]   And most of them were all front row seats.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.560]   My first date with my now husband was front row, Book of Mormon.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400]   We entered the lottery two hours before the show.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.440]   We won the lottery and we got that those seats for like, yeah, 20 bucks, maybe
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   30 bucks inflation. Who knows what it was, what it is now.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.600]   But it's cheap. It's really cheap.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   And my husband works on Broadway, so I get a couple extra connections through
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.760]   that. But I think part of it is, again, just being willing to ask, let people
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.120]   know and tap into your own network, too.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.400]   And, you know, you mentioned the lotteries, but there's also, you know, free
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.680]   performances that come up.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.120]   And this is where the social media aspect comes in.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.440]   Hamilton was, I think, doing something where they were filming a show and they
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.600]   needed to fill the audience for the taping.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.400]   And so, you know, on their Twitter, they posted something and you could then be
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.200]   like, oh, I want that ticket.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.360]   And you like filled out the Google form and they notified you.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   But, you know, you have to move quickly.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.640]   So part of it is just keeping on the pulse of what's going on and following, you
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.880]   know, the shows or the museums or whatever it is you want to do on Twitter.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.320]   I mean, that's a goldmine for free stuff.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.920]   Yeah. A couple other good hacks here.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.760]   So one I learned about when we were trying to see Hamilton before we got a lottery
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.160]   ticket was if you notice on a lot of sites like StubHub, if you're out a week, two
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.480]   weeks before the show, it's really expensive.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.800]   And then within like the last hour, everything gets really cheap because people
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.960]   are sitting on these tickets.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.040]   They're trying to make money.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.400]   And so if you just find and in New York, it's great.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.280]   Almost all the shows are right near each other.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.480]   And so what we would do is we would look like 30 minutes before and we would just
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   go to like a FedEx Kinko's to print off the tickets.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.000]   This is oftentimes they're not always able to be digital and which is to your
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.720]   advantage, right?
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.640]   If they are digital, you can go to the last second.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.360]   If they're not, those last 30 minutes, people will drop the price significantly
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.680]   because they just need to sell the tickets.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.880]   So we would do that.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.800]   There's also a lot of shows and especially live tapings where I'm not sure why they
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.560]   don't charge because there seems to be a lot of demand.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.200]   But we went to the Colbert Report.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.640]   We went to SNL.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.520]   That kind of stuff was all free.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.920]   It's all sign up.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.240]   Usually for SNL, you sign up like a year in advance or something.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.280]   And then they just send you an email.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.640]   They're like, hey, you have two tickets to this thing.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.440]   And by the way, if you ever do go to a live taping of SNL, the way it works is
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.640]   everyone lines up in the lobby of 30 Rock.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.240]   And there's people that just walk through that line and select the people who are
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.440]   going to sit on the floor.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.680]   And so my wife thought I was such a crazy person because I was like, every time this
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.920]   person comes near us, let's just start laughing and let's just like be funny.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   And like three times in a row, I was like, all right, now, now, now, now.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   So this woman walks by and I'm just like, my wife just starts laughing.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.600]   She's like, you're an idiot.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.320]   This is so we look ridiculous.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.200]   And then the fourth time she walked by, she was like, can you two please come in
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.720]   this line?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.560]   And so we moved into the floor seat line.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.600]   So that's my my little mini hack for for getting floor seats at SNL.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.200]   But yeah, I feel like I've tried everything I can to have this awesome experience in
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.880]   cities without having to pay for it.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.840]   And if I do have to pay for it, great.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.880]   But, you know, if there's a museum you want to go to, yeah, you can pay to go to it.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.840]   And then there are like days of the month where locals are either free or I remember
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.040]   for a while, Bank of America, like if you had a Bank of America debit card, you got
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.440]   in free on a lot of days.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.680]   Check those credit card rewards.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.080]   If you have an Amex, you can do so much.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   Yeah, they used to do a lot of pre-release movies before they come out.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.600]   There are actually I don't know if this is still a thing.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   COVID probably kind of tampered this down.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   But when I first moved to San Francisco, I found all these websites where you could
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.360]   sign up to go see pre-release movies and they would just all the time have free movie
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.880]   tickets to go see movies like the week before they came out.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.040]   And I always assumed they were going to ask me some survey to learn about the movie.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.840]   They never were.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.600]   I have no idea what was in it for them, but I probably went to the movie theater and saw
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.480]   like eight movies or 10 movies in my first couple of years here, totally free.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.200]   Any other city hacks, maybe on food or anything else that you think makes makes high
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.880]   cost of living a little bit lower?
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:00.840]   I mean, I think when it comes to the necessities, one of the things I did for medical
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   care for a long time was I made use of the schools.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.200]   We have excellent schools here.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.160]   So I went to NYU dental school and they have seriously discounted dental work that you
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.240]   can get. Even if you have health insurance, you might not have dental coverage.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.280]   So that was a big thing.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   We have a lot of great clinics here, public health resources.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.520]   Again, those tend to be pretty concentrated in cities.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.200]   So that's where there's a big benefit.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.000]   Obviously, it'd be great to have benefits that you don't need that stuff.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.280]   But in case you don't, it's a good thing to have.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.280]   And then even stuff like salon services.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.080]   I can't remember the last time I actually paid for a haircut because there's all these
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.800]   schools here that are cosmetology schools.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.360]   So they offer free haircuts.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.680]   It's called Salon Apprentice dot com.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.560]   And I think it's dot com.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.760]   If you Google Salon Apprentice, you'll find it.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.800]   It's in a lot of cities.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.880]   And you can just see if like a student is looking for somebody for a cut, for a color.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.120]   If it's not free, it's super discounted.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.720]   So there's just so much of that kind of stuff where you can even take some of your
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.600]   essentials and find ways to hack them.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.480]   Yeah, I remember being at the time, I remember it was like called a hair model or
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.880]   something. It's like, oh, but the only catch was for some of them, it's like, I want to
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.280]   work on this type of haircut.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.040]   So you have to make sure you don't pick someone that's like, I want to learn how to
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.480]   completely shave someone's head.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.600]   That might not be what you're looking for.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.000]   That is true, though.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.280]   I will give everybody some assurances that I have never had a horror story and I've
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.840]   probably done it 50 times.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.800]   Wow. And women's haircuts are much more expensive than men's haircuts.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.960]   So, yeah, to be fair, I'm not too concerned about how I look, but I do care a little
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.040]   bit. I do television.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.880]   So it is I can't look like totally out there.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:50.960]   Yeah. OK, so, you know, we very rarely talk about high cost of living hacks because
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.080]   especially in the industry, because so many of these bloggers are, you know, I read all
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.440]   these fire blogs that are like, oh, I'm trying to be financially independent.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.600]   Here's my hack so that you can live on $10,000 a year.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.280]   And I'm like, OK, I don't think I've seen an apartment that goes for $10,000 a year in
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   all of San Francisco.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.440]   So I think it's I think it's cool that there are actually ways to make make expensive,
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.120]   higher cost of living cities a lot cheaper.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.880]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.400]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.160]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.240]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.600]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go to app for
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.680]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.720]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.560]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.080]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.440]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.120]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.560]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.000]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.200]   selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.880]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.560]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.240]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.120]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.400]   And these cities have a ton of value they provide.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.760]   I hate when we reduce these conversations just to the expense alone, as opposed to
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.200]   thinking about what's the what's the total value of the experience, right?
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.880]   Yeah, it costs a lot of money to live in a big city, but if it connects you to a
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.600]   cultural circle that you care about, a community that you care about, career
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.280]   opportunities that you care about, as it does for me, as it does for my husband,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.080]   who's a Broadway stagehand, like being in New York has an enormous value.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.600]   And my career would not be where it is if I did not live here.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.480]   That's not to say that you can't have really wonderful career opportunities
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.760]   elsewhere and that I may not have found success in other ways.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:18.200]   But I attribute so much of the income gains that I've had and the career growth
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.480]   that I've had by the sheer fact that I am in the city where it happens in the room
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.440]   where it happens so much of the time.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.720]   So one of the things that Covid has kind of brought up is this kind of so-called
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.000]   exodus from all of the cities.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.440]   And I know so many people that are now trying to geo arbitrage.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.240]   They're like, oh, I'm going to move to the middle of Nebraska and I'm going to
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.960]   work remotely. I'm going to make my Bay Area salary and pay Nebraska rent.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.320]   And it's going to be fantastic.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.760]   And, you know, I still live in San Francisco.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.680]   You still live in New York, presumably for a similar reason to what you just
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:59.920]   described, which is I believe that the career financial life upside of being in
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.080]   the middle of where an industry that you're a part of is is happening.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   And I think for me, that's worth it.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   And like you, I've seen a lot of benefit in the past.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.280]   Do you think that benefit keeps coming or do you think anything major has actually
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.000]   changed in the way we work such that that value proposition is is less now in a
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   post-Covid world?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.160]   There's been nothing more powerful in my career than face to face interactions, and
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.800]   I do not foresee that changing.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   I do believe there will be more opportunity for hybrid work, for flexible work.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.640]   But it is really hard to recreate the experience of being in a room with
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.960]   somebody, not just because of just the physical interaction, but it just
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.160]   facilitates a night, right?
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.600]   Like you're not just meeting for the hour that you have coffee with somebody or for
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.760]   the networking thing.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.400]   It's like, OK, let's go get dinner.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.600]   Let's go get drinks.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.720]   Let's go see a show.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.160]   And I do think that building relationships, even whether it's for personal or
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.840]   professional reasons, I think it requires that amount of spontaneousness.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   And I think it requires that interaction.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   If you're going to create a level of depth and in my experience, it's depth of
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.440]   relationship that really creates the opportunities that have created the most
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.520]   benefit for me.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.840]   Now, I'm not going to say there's no value, obviously, in having that off the grid
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.280]   lifestyle. Of course, that's high value.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.400]   And if you're in a place in your career where you feel really confident and secure
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.880]   and you don't really have much interest in pivoting into something else, great.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.720]   Go do it. But I do think there's a lot of risk that hasn't been talked about in
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   going out and like living 300 miles away from wherever you are now and just
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.480]   assuming that you're going to be stable for the rest of your life under the same
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.160]   conditions that have brought you to where you are in your career now.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.040]   Yeah, I I totally agree.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.320]   I think maybe the type of work you do could matter.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.080]   I think in in in a world where relationships are really important to your job, if
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.320]   you're in sales, like it just seems really important if you are an engineer and
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.640]   that's just what you want to do and you found a company and you want to work there
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.400]   for 10 years. Yeah, you might be able to save a significant amount of money.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.880]   I know, at least on the rent side, you could save a significant amount of money
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.280]   leaving the Bay Area.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.800]   But if your aspiration is to start a company, if your aspiration is to run an
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.880]   entire organization or a team, I think it's I think I personally think you're missing
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.520]   out on value by being where it happens.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.240]   But I am jealous of the people who took the last two years to move somewhere else
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.960]   and just completely geo arbitrage their income while all of those room where it
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   happens are closed.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.680]   Let me tell you one thing about that, because I spent almost a year of my
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.880]   pandemic in upstate New York in a beautiful place with my family.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.920]   And it was wonderful in many ways.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.600]   I could not be happier to be back in New York City.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.080]   And I think part of this is also knowing yourself.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.600]   I think some people are more attuned to the value proposition that a city provides
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.280]   and some people are more attuned to the opposite.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.240]   And I think sometimes we romanticize both.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   And I think part of it is about getting really honest with yourself about what you
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.080]   care about. And at the end of the day, I care about having access to delivery and
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.600]   take out of good food 24/7.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.760]   Yes, huge value.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.520]   OK, so you just mentioned family and there's a lot of stuff I want to cover.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.360]   But a thing that I realized is I spent the last week talking with family on both
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.320]   sides about what are we doing for Thanksgiving?
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   What are we doing for Christmas?
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.240]   And one of the things that I've heard you give advice about, I think you've been on
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.320]   like Good Morning America talking about is gifting and the holidays.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.000]   And I'm just wondering, as we approach this time of year, are there any hacks you
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.680]   have around finding gifts for people, buying gifts, deals, shopping, any of that
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.840]   stuff that people might want to use?
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   So I'm of the philosophy that my time and energy is not particularly well spent by
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.560]   going deep into the weeds of couponing and comparison shopping.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:19.200]   That said, I'm interested in anything I can do that easily facilitates a discount.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:25.120]   So, you know, installing a browser extension that searches for deals and coupons
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.160]   automatically when I'm buying things online or cashback portal where you go in and
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.560]   it's like, oh, you get five percent cash back if you shop at J.Crew on this day.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.480]   And I'm shopping for J.Crew anyway.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.240]   Great. Happy to do that.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.680]   That's pretty easy, pretty seamless, pretty low lift for an easy reward.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.840]   So that's the kind of hack that I'm interested in.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.520]   The other thing is, like, I have really no issue with opting out of things, and I know
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.400]   that's very difficult for most people.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.680]   I think a lot of holiday stuff, and this is probably true for anything related to
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.880]   family, you know, you're talking about family, things like weddings, things like
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.800]   birthdays, anything where there's a sense of obligation, where things get emotional,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.840]   where they get sticky.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.120]   I think it's the emotional piece of it where people get really carried away and
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.800]   that's where things get out of hand.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.880]   So I think part of it has been for me just kind of interrogating, what is this really
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.400]   for? What is the gifting really about?
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   What am I trying to do with the gift?
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:30.160]   And that has really made me realize that, like, for me, gifting and the holidays is
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.760]   about spending time with my family.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:37.360]   It's not about, you know, making sure that I'm partaking in the office Secret Santa
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.080]   because everyone else is doing it.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   I can tell you that I rarely partake in any kind of ancillary gifting groups, and it
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   has made no difference in the quality of my network or experience.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.520]   And it's not like I'm a Grinch and, you know, I think that you all should not be
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.760]   doing this and/or I'm a cheapskate.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.080]   It's just there's just not enough value that comes out of the experience.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:10.800]   And that sounds super cold, but to me, it's like, OK, do I want to spend like fifty
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.240]   dollars on ten different group gifting circles or do I want to buy a plane ticket so I
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.560]   can go visit my family?
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.560]   That's not a difficult exchange.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.640]   I think we're just not being honest about how much of leakage there is through this
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.800]   little stuff that adds like no value.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.520]   And then also just a little soapbox, I'm very against like decor and candy of all
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.280]   kinds. Wow.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:44.960]   I just don't find that it's like this this little junk that is so expensive as it
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:52.360]   collects and then like you have to deal with it afterwards versus like if I don't buy
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:59.040]   any of that, what I can do is get you, I don't know, not an Apple Watch, nothing that
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.560]   expensive, but something like actually useful, maybe a subscription to like Broadway
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.880]   HD, because my mother loves Broadway and Broadway's been closed so she can stream it
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.960]   for the next year. So again, for me, a lot of money stuff is not necessarily about the
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.600]   numbers so much as it is about the value and then like really getting clear on what's
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.760]   the purpose of the thing I'm trying to do.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.280]   And honestly, spending fifty dollars on candy canes for like a hundred different
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.120]   people is not a good value for me.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.320]   Yeah, so I've gotten in a little bit of trouble in the last few years with my family
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.680]   perspective on gifting.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:42.560]   I've always thought that the idea of creating a list of the things that I want and
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.120]   sending it to family and having them buy the thing on the list is like my nightmare
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.600]   because things in my world either fall into I really want them or I don't.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.760]   And if I want them, I'm going to find a way to buy them.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.240]   And a lot of times I'll buy them on Facebook Marketplace or I'll wait for them to go
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.840]   on sale and I'll use cashback portals and all this stuff.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.800]   If someone else buys them, the thing that I could have gotten for thirty bucks, they're
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.080]   paying fifty dollars and that drives me crazy.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.840]   The other thing that drives me crazy is everyone's always asking like a month out.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.080]   They're like, what do you want? So then you go do some research and you're like, well,
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.600]   here's seven things that I want to buy.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.880]   Now I just want them.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.640]   So it's like the whole gifting for me got so stressful because I'd find a thing that I
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.480]   finally am like, yes, I want this shirt.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.920]   And then it's like now I've got to wait five weeks to have the shirt and I know you're
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.240]   going to overpay for the shirt.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.960]   And all I really wanted was like some kind of gift that was meaningful.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.240]   Like I care much less about the fact that you're willing to spend fifty dollars on me
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.280]   than I do that you spent a little bit of time trying to find something that you thought
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.800]   would be cool.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:50.360]   And so I proposed that we just do away with lists and everyone thought that was crazy.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.520]   And so then I went one step to the extreme to try to make my point.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.080]   And this is where it kind of went off the rails.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.640]   I said, look, if we're all just going to buy each other things off each other's lists,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.360]   what if we just made a spreadsheet and we all typed in how much we were going to spend
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   on each other and then we just netted it out?
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.560]   So if you were willing to spend eighty dollars on me and I was willing to spend seventy
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.120]   dollars on you, you could just Venmo me ten dollars and we just call it a day.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.280]   And they're like, well, that takes the fun out of it.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   And I was like, I know, but it's already not fun.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.320]   Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.640]   It did not go well.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.000]   Of course it didn't go well.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   I totally get it.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.480]   You know what I wish for gifts?
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.120]   I wish I could buy gifts when I see something and I'm like, oh, that's perfect for so
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.520]   and so. And that's it.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.240]   I don't buy them any other gifts any other time.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.400]   I just get the thing when I'm like, oh, that is the thing for this person.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.640]   So that's so when you talk about opting out, it's interesting.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.760]   We finally got to a place with families that, you know, we don't see both sides of the
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.400]   family for Christmas every year.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.440]   So we just said, hey, look, on the years that we're not going to see you guys, we're
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.160]   opting out and everyone actually opted out.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.440]   So we just don't do gifts there.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.920]   And then on the years that we do, we actually just have a there's my my wife has two
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.360]   sisters and parents.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.240]   So there's four kind of groups.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   We just everyone gets one person.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.600]   We get them one gift.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:12.280]   And like we call it a day except for kids, everyone under like 10 is opted in every
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.720]   year. The kids get some gifts because it's exciting.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.920]   But all the adults have kind of gotten to a point that they opted out, which has
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.560]   actually worked incredibly well.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.320]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.360]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes, deals and
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.920]   discounts from our partners.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.160]   You can go to all the hacks dot com slash deals.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.560]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   I was going to ask you how you are feeling about navigating all this now as a parent,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   because I do not have children, but I think it would make me crazy if people kept
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.480]   buying my kid just garbage.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.000]   So the number of gifts we've already thrown out is like I can't count on my hand
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.800]   because everyone's like, oh, I sent you this thing.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.160]   And it's like we got this one stuffed animal and it was like covered in like this
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.640]   smelly glitter. And it just seemed like it was the cheapest thing ever.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.680]   And if someone put it in their mouth, they would probably get some toxic chemical.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.040]   And so I do think that, you know, registries for kids is one of these hysterical
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.160]   things where you're like, here are the 20 things we need for our kid.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.400]   And they're like, I'm so glad you sent that list.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.240]   I got you this other thing that I thought you would want.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:29.440]   And I'm like, I'm like, no, if I wanted it, I would have put it on the list every now
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.680]   and then. It's a really cool sentimental thing.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.040]   Sure. But for the most part, they're not.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.720]   But your dream is something my wife and I have decided, which is we no longer do
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.000]   birthday and Christmas gifts for each other.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.800]   We just throughout the year, when we see something really exciting for each other, we
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.280]   buy it and we just have random gifts.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.720]   It's like, hey, we're at dinner.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.360]   And I'm like, I saw this book.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   I thought you'd love it. And a cool book that I will actually share, which I think is
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.680]   really cool, is this website or book or company called Adventure Challenge.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:06.440]   So the whole premise is you get this book and it's like 50 dates, but you don't know
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.520]   what they are and you have to scratch them off and you commit to doing them.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.200]   And they give you some requirements.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.560]   So it's like tonight you're going to need two hours.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.640]   It needs to be dark out and you need 30 bucks.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.480]   And then you just see this thing and you're like, all right, you're ready.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.600]   We're going to scratch this off.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.880]   And that's it. So that was a recent gift.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.120]   And we've only gone on one date and it sent us to Target to make like little scrapbooks
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.600]   for each other with stickers.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.520]   It was like it sounded like the dumbest thing ever.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.360]   And then we did it and we went to like a bar and got some beers and we were like putting
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.600]   these stickers in. We felt like we were designing our trapper keepers back in the day.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.200]   But I shout out to Adventure Challenge because I thought that was a really fun gift that
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.280]   keeps on giving, I guess.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:53.560]   I love that. I've also taken to having the best gifting experience with my husband, which
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.760]   at this point is really just treating ourselves to extravagant meals and trips.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.080]   And I honestly, if that's what gifting was, I would be much happier.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.840]   Yes, I think we both share that love for travel.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.480]   OK, so we haven't talked at all about the biggest thing that I think you're working on
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.520]   right now. Maybe there's multiple, but, you know, last in the middle of the pandemic, you
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:22.000]   started a podcast and it was something that I don't think I'd really seen recently, which
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.320]   was talking to people kind of off the record confidentially about their money issues and
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.280]   trying to solve them.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:33.160]   And so I'd love to hear a little bit about how that came together and some of the
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.080]   interesting things you've been learning that maybe you were surprised by.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.560]   Yeah, so the podcast is produced in partnership.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.240]   Well, it's their podcast. It's Real Simple Magazine.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.920]   And so they hired me as the host and I'm a producer on the show.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   And they basically had this idea of we really want to talk to people confidentially
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.240]   about their money problem and then have an expert come on and explain how to solve the
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.920]   problem. And that's the framework they gave me.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.720]   And I was like, hmm, this could go so many ways.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.320]   How are we going to really bring it together?
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:14.040]   And one of the things that I've found in doing the actual interviews and seeing what
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:20.080]   brings it together is that it's almost never about the money.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:27.320]   It's almost always about the feelings about the money, the shame, the fear, the
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:36.520]   everything else, the family, the friend, the husband, the wife, you know, and almost
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:42.960]   every single person thinks they are totally alone and it makes them feel like they're a
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.720]   failure. Everybody else around them is succeeding and they are hopeless.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:53.880]   And so they internalize whatever they're going through as this experience of, oh, it's
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.080]   just me as an identity.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.360]   I am bad with money and that is who I am.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.920]   And that is just a quality that I must have been born with or inherited from my family.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   And thus, there is no hope.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.400]   And that is a really painful place to try to make a positive change from it.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.080]   You can't really, like, hack your way out of that.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.840]   You know, we talk about optimizing these things, using the deal sites and trying to set
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.600]   these boundaries of people in our lives.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:30.840]   But if you are in a place where you don't even think it's possible for you to change, if
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.440]   you're saying I'm bad with money, not I've made a money mistake, that's a really hard
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.760]   place to move forward from.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.280]   And so on the show, when we're talking to people and we bring on the experts, not only
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.800]   do we have to go into the hacks of like, OK, here's what this means for your spreadsheet
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.520]   and here's what this means for your budget and your investment account and your savings
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:57.560]   account. We also have to go into, well, here's what this means for your relationship to
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.160]   your mother or here's what this means for your relationship to yourself.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.480]   And it is really emotional.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   And I don't say that to to say that we're trying to be a kind of therapy podcast.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.560]   We're not. But I notice when it's confidential, people start to open up about what's
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.400]   really behind why the numbers on the page aren't adding up.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.320]   And when people do that, you really just start to see how much of it is about shame and
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.400]   isolation and how much can really be helped by having these conversations that you and
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   I are having where we're like, I actually hate this thing that we all do.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.640]   You know, maybe we should change that.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:40.680]   Because if you don't have that conversation, you you continue to feel obligated and you
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.880]   continue to feel overstretched and you continue to get trapped in this cycle where
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.360]   nothing's working out for you.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   So I think the coolest thing about the show has just been really talking to the listeners
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:55.800]   themselves and seeing what they've been willing to be vulnerable about and like realize
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.760]   for themselves in the process of sharing what's going on, because a lot of it is these
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.320]   aha moments that they never thought about before.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   They never thought about, oh, well, why isn't this working?
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.040]   And, you know, the budget's not working.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.360]   But as they talk it out, you can hear them start to have these aha moments.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.200]   And that's super cool.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.720]   Can you walk through an example of an interview you've done and kind of some of the
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.680]   learnings you've had?
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.080]   Yeah, we had one listener on the show who called in and she said, you know, I'm really
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.600]   struggling to figure out how to plan for the future with my boyfriend because, you know,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.680]   I make 30 percent more than he does.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.640]   Oh, no, it wasn't 30 percent more as $30,000 more than he does.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.320]   Just a significant income difference.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.680]   And she was in her mid 20s.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.040]   They were both in their mid 20s.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.720]   And presumably that difference could grow a lot more in the future.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.240]   And so she's like, you know, I just can't seem to figure out how we're going to make
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.720]   it work. And what I realized in talking to her and having her talk through, you know,
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:01.320]   how they were managing the expenses, what did it look like when the paychecks came in?
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.600]   What did the conversations look like around dividing expenses up was all of their
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:13.560]   conversations were based on the premise that fair is 50/50 and there is nothing else.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:20.080]   And it was just an interesting assumption that equal is same.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.400]   And that is not necessarily true.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.480]   You know, what does equal mean in a relationship?
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:31.200]   It sounds like a super heavy topic, but if you've never really interrogated that, then
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.400]   you can't make a good financial plan for your relationship because the fact is almost
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.640]   nothing is ever 50/50 in the course of not just a moment in time, but certainly over
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.680]   the course of a marriage that could potentially be 20, 30, 40 years.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.320]   And so that's an example of something that it starts with, like this really simple
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.040]   thing. It's like, well, how do we split our rent?
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.560]   You know, I make thirty thousand dollars more than he does.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.440]   But then if you kind of strip away all the layers, what it's really about is like, oh,
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:07.640]   well, I've been conditioned to think that like what it means to be an empowered woman
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.800]   in a relationship is that, you know, it's equal 50/50 and I'm making more.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.480]   So what does that mean now that I'm the breadwinner and where do my thoughts about
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.880]   this come from and why is it creating resentment and why is this now a point of
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.280]   tension in our every day?
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:30.600]   And so it's just like really wild to see what comes up when you keep digging behind
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.840]   the layers and asking more questions.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.920]   And what's the advice for someone like that?
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.840]   Is it to just talk about it?
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.920]   Is it, you know, how do you get past it?
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.360]   Is it just, you know, it doesn't have to be 50/50?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:50.120]   So a lot of the money stuff is like what it's not about the money stuff again, like
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.600]   always comes back to everything else.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.680]   It's like, OK, what is your perception of what it means to be fair?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.880]   What is the model of behavior you experienced growing up?
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:07.400]   Was it that your parent told you that you had to do everything and provide for
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.440]   everyone? Was it that it's a bad thing if you're a woman and you make more money than
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.080]   your spouse? And so, you know, you should feel somehow ashamed if you're in that
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.640]   position. These might not be things that were explicitly said to you, but these are
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   also things that you might need to stop and go through those memory banks to be like,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.080]   wait, what are these kind of models of behavior I either witnessed growing up or the
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.840]   messages I got, whether they were explicit or maybe like maybe not so explicit, but
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.040]   you felt it. And then you have to talk about those things with your partner because
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.080]   you both had totally different experiences growing up.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.960]   And so you're not going to match perfectly with your finances because you have had
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.520]   completely different outlooks.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.720]   You have had completely different histories.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.000]   You had completely different models of behavior.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:01.040]   And the only way to really get on the same page about what is fair is to kind of
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.360]   interrogate all of those things together.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.680]   And it's really uncomfortable to do that, especially when you're dating because, you
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.400]   know, you don't want to sit down on the first date and be like, you know, tell me
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.800]   your entire family history with money and your credit score and your debt load.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.120]   You know, that's not the answer.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   But the answer is, right, the answer is, though, that like you can't lean out of that
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.880]   conversation entirely until you're after a legally like financially obligated to
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.840]   somebody in a marriage, which is unfortunately, I think what happens a lot.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:34.280]   Yeah, I saw on your website a guide of 25 talks to have with your partner about money.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.080]   So I'm going to link to that in the show notes, because I imagine that would help a
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.680]   lot of people get past these things.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.640]   It does. And it also kind of lays out at what point in the relationship to do these
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.440]   things, because, again, you don't want to be that person on the first date asking
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.480]   about, you know, student loan balances.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.760]   Yeah. I mean, this isn't money related, but something I found was when we had our
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.680]   daughter, my wife doesn't have the same last name as me.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.960]   And, you know, that was something that didn't matter to me.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.360]   But she was kind of like, are you sure?
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.600]   Are you OK? And I'm like, yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.800]   So then we have to pick what our daughter's last name is.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.320]   And for most people, it's just like assumed.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.720]   And I think for me, I was like, well, you have a cooler last name, like your last
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.480]   name's Fox. That's a pretty cool name.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.920]   We should give our daughter that name.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.520]   And it was just surprising how many people were like blown away by the fact that we
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:31.360]   gave our daughter my wife's last name, so much so that some people either chose to
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   ignore it or didn't know or just assumed.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.560]   And they'd like sent her like, you know, a monogrammed pillow with the wrong
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.960]   initials and that kind of stuff, as if, you know.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.760]   And so I just realized that her assumption of what we would do and my assumption of
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.920]   what we would do weren't even on the same page.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.720]   And when we talked about it, it was like, oh, OK, she'll have, you know, and mine's a
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.760]   little more systematic.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.160]   I personally, I really struggle with hyphenated names because I'm like, well, if
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.240]   we give all our kids hyphenated names, then all our kids are going to get married to
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.640]   other kids with hyphenated names.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.920]   Then they're going to have quadruple hyphenated names.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.520]   And then their kids are going to have eight last names and so on and so on.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.840]   So mine's more like a process and system argument for not doing that.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.920]   But I think my wife also just has a much cooler last name.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:20.400]   And I slightly regret not taking her last name because I feel like Chris Fox would just
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   be a much better podcast host, much better name on the billboard, all those things.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.480]   I mean, it's never too late.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.760]   So one of a few things that you touched on in that conversation was about, you know,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.840]   you talk to this woman who makes more than her husband.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.280]   And I know you've been spending a lot of time digging into the data that comes around.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:47.040]   And by data, I mean studies, research with women who make more than their husbands try
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.160]   to be too ambitious.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.920]   And you've even kind of coined the term the ambition penalty.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.000]   Could you talk a little bit about what you've been learning and what you've been
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.920]   sharing? And we'll go from there.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:06.080]   Yeah, so I got really interested in a lot of the advice that we have been giving women
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.480]   in particular in order to close these really persistent gaps in pay and wealth and
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.640]   leadership and workforce representation, because I think in the last decade or so, you've
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.720]   seen a lot of the Instagrammable advice of like, OK, just speak up, just be more
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.880]   aggressive, just ask for more, just negotiate.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:32.560]   And I wanted to challenge the assumption that women were not doing those things.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.920]   And what happened is when I looked into the data, what I found is women actually are
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.960]   doing a lot of these things.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.400]   They are asking for more.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.560]   They are speaking up.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.840]   They are trying to reach leadership positions.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:50.680]   But what happens is when women engage in these behaviors, there is a backlash to the
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:56.000]   behavior. So there's a lot of studies that look at, for example, a resume.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.240]   And what happens if you change the name from a Howard to a Heidi is if you have all of
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:08.200]   the same qualifications, if you have, you know, all of the same perceptions otherwise
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.560]   other than the name, then the Howard is more likely to be judged favorably compared to
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.440]   the Heidi, who not only is she less likely to be judged favorably if the cover letter
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:27.120]   is seen as somehow aggressive or self-advocating, then she's actually likely to get a
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.600]   backlash. She's likely to be labeled unlikable.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:36.520]   And this isn't just about likability, this has real tangible financial consequences.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.880]   In fact, on one episode of Money Confidential, I interviewed a woman who was
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:49.120]   negotiating her salary after getting a job offer and the job offer was rescinded as a
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.480]   result. So they withdrew the job offer.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   That is a tangible financial penalty that woman got for trying to negotiate a raise.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.360]   And that is not an anomaly.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.920]   This has been borne out in the data.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.120]   And that's just one example, a job offer being rescinded.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.200]   This happens when women try to get promotions, reach leadership positions.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.400]   There's all of this backlash and a lot of it has a tangible cost.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:22.280]   And my takeaway in covering this is not that, well, we should just not negotiate or we
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.200]   should just not try to reach these leadership positions or whatever else it is.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.320]   My takeaway is we need to broaden the conversation so that it's not so overly
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.640]   simplistic, because when you say, oh, just speak up, just be more confident, just be
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.920]   more assertive. The assumption is that somehow we're not already doing these things
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.280]   and that getting to pay equity is as simple as that.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.360]   And the truth is, it's not that simple.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.400]   It's being borne out in the data that it's not that simple.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.960]   And it also puts so much of the onus on women, especially women of color, basically
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:07.360]   anyone who's, you know, outside of the gender binary to be the person who's going to
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.920]   solve for what's really a structural inequity.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.160]   And so I think for all of us who are trying to navigate in this world, we need to have a
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.920]   broader conversation about how do we recognize these biases and then how do we manage
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:25.480]   them in the context of these conversations of negotiating, getting leadership positions,
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.880]   leaning in, all of that.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:34.120]   So. I mean, it's fascinating that a lot of times I hear these stories, but I've never
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:39.280]   dug into it, so you've actually like linked out to a lot of different studies that show
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.240]   what's happening, and I went deep on a couple of them and like, you know, the Journal of
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.640]   Psychology and that kind of stuff. What do you think someone listening today, and
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.840]   especially for me, right, I'm on the other side of of the gender here, what can I start
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.040]   doing to make this better?
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.880]   Is it as simple as just talking about it?
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.200]   What can happen at work?
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:06.000]   What can we do to promote an environment that kind of makes this I mean, it's not going
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.360]   to go away overnight, but kind of works on making this go away.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.280]   I think talking about it is actually more powerful than we might think it is, because
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.800]   as we kind of talked about earlier, a lot of this stuff isn't explicit.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.720]   Nobody is out there being like, we don't want women to be leaders.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.320]   We don't we want to suppress the ambitions of minorities.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.640]   Nobody is saying that.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.600]   But this stuff is really deep.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.640]   It's structural.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.480]   And so part of it is really just bringing awareness to the ways in which we do
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.040]   undermine women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals when they do advocate for
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.960]   themselves. And if you see it happening, you know, if you're in a position of power to
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.080]   go ahead and say something that means something.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.120]   If you can support that person through the process of a negotiation and be their mentor,
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.480]   be their advocate, that means something.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:04.720]   I think part of this, too, especially in personal finance world, is that we have to do
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:11.040]   better. Myself included, I have given that advice of, you know, be more confident.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:18.320]   But that is really insulting to just imply that confidence alone is going to solve for
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.520]   what is really a structural and systemic inequity.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.600]   And so I think we have to say, OK, you know, if we see a little gap in how much men and
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.840]   women are negotiating, maybe we should interrogate why.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.000]   What is going on there?
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.120]   Is it because women aren't confident or is it because they have a realistic and borne
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.000]   out fear of backlash?
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.040]   It's not just a lack of confidence.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:50.720]   It's a real legitimate and borne out proven fear that if I do this, I'm going to be
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.680]   labeled aggressive. I'm going to be labeled unlikable.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:59.880]   They're going to say I'm not a great fit for this company the next time that I'm in the
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.480]   running for a promotion.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:07.760]   So I think part of it is really about just interrogating the assumptions we have around
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.680]   a lot of the career and financial advice that we are giving to these historically
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   marginalized communities.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:21.720]   Are there any tactics that someone in one of these communities can use to try to
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:27.000]   lighten or reduce the likelihood that they face this backlash?
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:34.120]   Yeah, so a lot of this, you know, I mean, my research around why this is happening,
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:40.600]   that part of it stems from our expectations around how certain communities are, quote
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.160]   unquote, supposed to act.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.360]   And historically speaking, women are, quote unquote, supposed to act in a way that is
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.960]   deferential, that is serving, that is nurturing of the community.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:57.800]   And men are supposed to, quote unquote, act in this way that is, you know, aggressive
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.920]   and being the provider.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:06.200]   And so basically what happens is when a woman asserts the qualities that we associate
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:12.800]   with, you know, heteronormative masculinity, this isn't typically a conscious thing, but
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.920]   subconsciously there's this feeling of like, oh, you know, that's just like a little bit
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   too much, you know, there's just a little bit not the right fit.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:27.440]   And we have this instinctive reaction around like, we don't like this person because
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.320]   they're not conforming to this expectation of how we think they should behave.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.760]   And so what we can do as people managing these biases, if you're a woman and, you know,
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:46.400]   you know that you're in a company where maybe there's some bias and discrimination
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.240]   you've seen firsthand, maybe you can think, OK, so I know that I'm in an environment
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.400]   where there is a lot of this bias.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:01.760]   What is it that I can do to advocate for myself in a way that's not going to be seen as
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:07.720]   I'm the bitch or difficult or whatever for just engaging in these very basic self-advocacy
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:14.800]   behaviors? So what I can do is frame my ambition through the net benefit to the
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:21.520]   organization. So, for example, if I'm saying if what I really want is a raise, what I
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:28.960]   can do is instead of framing what I think I should get a raise for through just me and
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:36.280]   my contributions, I can also frame it through the perspective of what this work has
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:42.840]   done to benefit the community, the people around me, the company, and really play more
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:49.040]   into that traditional nurturing vibe, even as you're doing this self-advocacy that
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.400]   might be seen as more masculine, if that makes sense.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.120]   No, it makes total sense.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.960]   So there is so much we could keep going.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.160]   I actually have a bunch of questions that I'll save for the next conversation.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.000]   But where can people who want to see some of this data and want to learn more about
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.400]   what you're learning find everything you're doing?
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.640]   Yeah, so I've been writing a lot more in detail about the ambition penalty and sharing
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.160]   these first-hand accounts that women have had on my Bulletin, which is a newsletter
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.600]   service, which you can find at ambition.bulletin.com.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.680]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.280]   And anything else that you're working on online or anywhere that people should look
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.400]   for? Yeah, you can listen to our Money Confidential podcast wherever you're listening
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.440]   to this podcast and hear some, you know, not just experts, but real people sharing the
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.520]   real stories and like a lot of the interesting emotions and stories behind those numbers
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.920]   on the page, which I always find fascinating.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.640]   Yeah, I've been listening.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.600]   It's fantastic.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.120]   Stephanie, thank you so much for joining.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.800]   What a fun time.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.520]   Thank you.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:04.080]   Wow. I always have so much fun talking with Stephanie, and I hope you all enjoyed the
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.840]   conversation, too. For anyone new here, I love hearing from listeners and especially
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.920]   love hearing about topics you'd love me to cover in the future or any questions I can
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   answer in a future Mailbag episode.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.640]   Speaking of which, if you tuned into the last Q&A episode, I'd love to know what you
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.960]   think. So please shoot me a quick note and let me know if you want to see more or less
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   episodes like that.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.920]   You can always get a hold of me at Chris@allthehacks.com or I'm @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.880]   And finally, if you're not already subscribed to the All The Hacks newsletter, please

[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.880]   All right. That's it for now.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.960]   See you next week.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   [MUSIC]
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.020]   you
