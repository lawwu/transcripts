[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm thrilled to have you on my journey to optimize my
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560]   life, and I couldn't be more excited for the conversation I'm about to have with
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.160]   Stephanie O'Connell-Rodriguez.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.880]   She's the author of The Broken Beautiful Life.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   She's the founder of Statement Event and Statement Cards and the host of the
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.120]   incredible podcast Money Confidential.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   She has a wealth of knowledge about finance, and her work has been featured in
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.680]   The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and she's appeared as an
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.640]   expert on ABC World News, Bloomberg and so many more places.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.520]   In our conversation, we'll talk about some great hacks for expensive cities,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.560]   whether you live there or just visiting.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.720]   We'll talk about some of the ways we've tried to change things up around the
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.520]   holidays for gifting, both to save money and to get back to the true spirit of
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.080]   giving, and we'll dive into some fascinating things Stephanie's been
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.320]   learning about money from the first season of her podcast, where she's gone
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   deep to solve some real money issues for her listeners.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.040]   All right, let's jump in.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.000]   Stephanie, thanks for being here.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.800]   Oh, man, it's been a long time coming.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   I know.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.280]   So we met in 2018, and I've only really known you as a money person.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520]   This is kind of what you've been doing.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   But as I researched this podcast, I realized you did not grow up and start
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.800]   your professional career with the aspiration of being a financial expert.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   So I would love to understand how you went from, you know, I'll let you tell
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.200]   the story, but to becoming this financial expert.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   Yeah, like you said, talking about money for a living was the farthest thing from
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.240]   my mind as a young teenager millennial with a lot of dreams in the nineties.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.600]   Right.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   So I went to college with the aspiration that I was going to be a Broadway
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.760]   performer, and it was so much of that narrative of like, you know, pursue your
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.680]   dreams, follow your passion, and everything's going to work itself out.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   You know, this naive notion that we all had growing up a little bit like American
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.800]   dream for the millennial generation, and then I actually did work in the arts for
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   about five to seven years full time.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   And when I say full time, you know, I made money performing, but I also, you
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.760]   know, waited tables.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   I was a personal assistant.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.160]   I basically did anything I could do to make money in legitimate ways in between
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   my jobs, because I would go out and I'd be on a tour for like a year.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   And I was always interested in the money aspect of it, the money making aspect of
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.640]   it.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.400]   And I would just squirrel away everything I earned and we would get per diem.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.800]   And I'd be like, Ooh, this is not taxable income.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920]   Let me save as much of this as I can.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.680]   And then I would come home and be like, I can't bear to spend any of this money I
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   just made.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.200]   It took so much work.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   Let me go find all of these side hustles.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   And basically the reason I got into money was that cycle was completely
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   unsustainable. It was exhausting.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   I was tired of making very little.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.680]   I was just feeling like I was never going to get ahead.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.480]   One of the big turning points for me was having an accident with no, not an
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.960]   accident, an incident with my teeth.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.320]   It's like, oh, you go to the dentist one day and then they're like, you need to
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.760]   have a dental implant.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.880]   That's going to cost two thousand dollars.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.560]   And I just sobbed.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   I sobbed in the dentist chair in front of the dentist like a lunatic because I
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.800]   couldn't fathom where that money was going to come from.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.400]   And I was like, this is the worst feeling.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.560]   I am totally at the mercy of the money that I do not have and I do not like it.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.160]   And I want this to change.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.440]   And that got me very into personal finance like the nerd that I have become with
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.040]   my spreadsheets and my personal finance books.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.240]   And now eventually into a career where I cover personal finance full time.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.160]   And one thing you didn't mention is that all of this was happening in New York
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.880]   City, not not the cheapest city in the country or the world, probably one of the
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.720]   most expensive.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.080]   I think this is the hard thing about a lot of low paying careers is that they're
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.720]   centered in very expensive cities.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   So think about the arts, right?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.080]   It's New York or L.A., generally speaking.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.200]   If you think about fashion, if you think about PR, even these are careers that are
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   very notoriously poorly paying in some of the most expensive places in the world.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.280]   And so what I did find to be really helpful was that I wasn't alone in my
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.120]   pursuit of trying to make it and actually leaning on community of people who are
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   similarly not making a lot of money in these big cities was a huge help because
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.440]   for me, status quo was not having my own apartment in the financial district where
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.840]   it costs three to four thousand dollars a month.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.320]   Status quo was having four roommates and subletting your room whenever you can to
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.120]   make extra money and, you know, splitting things and living out in Inwood or in the
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Heights or wherever else to cut costs.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.680]   So I think part of it was just having an understanding of what your version of
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.720]   normal is.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.640]   For me, it's been at 35.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   I've never lived alone.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.600]   And that's normal.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.560]   And that that perception has saved me a lot of money over time.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah, I started my career in New York as well.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.400]   I had a job that paid more, but not enough to really live that kind of life that you
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.080]   want to live.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.840]   I actually worked as an intern for the first nine months of my professional post
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.760]   college career.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.920]   And that's a story for another day.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.560]   But interns don't make the most.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.320]   But what's interesting, and I'm curious if you had the same experience, is a lot of
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   the things that I did to save money early on living in a city.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.120]   Yes, they were.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   Some of them are things that I probably don't do anymore, but a lot of them carry
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.360]   through.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.960]   And I think as we've talked over the past few years, I've learned neither one of us
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.880]   wants to have a crappy experience in life.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.280]   Like we want to like do the things you you worked in the arts.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.520]   You want to participate in that.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.560]   You want to go to shows.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.240]   We both like food.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.720]   I'd love to just dig into some of the things that you did either before or even
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.080]   continue to do in a city to make it kind of an amazing experience, but to still spend
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.760]   less money and save more and be really responsible.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.800]   Yeah, as you mentioned, I love to go out.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.280]   I love to see things.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.360]   I love to have really fantastic experiences.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.280]   And the wonderful thing about cities is they are just bastions for free cultural
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.200]   enrichment. And there is just endless calendars of workshops.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.600]   You can go to performances.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.640]   You can go to things you can do that literally cost zero dollars.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.000]   Of course, at this point in my life, I am very happy to pay for these experiences, too.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.840]   But as you mentioned, you know, early on, there just wasn't the money for an
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.520]   entertainment budget, to be honest.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.280]   But what I used to do is I would go to the New York Public Library website where they
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   have a very comprehensive list of all of the events that are coming up and the
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.760]   exhibitions that are coming up and the concerts and talking series, almost all of
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.520]   which are completely free.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   And this is not a New York specific things.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   Almost every town or city has a parks department calendar, has a library calendar,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.760]   has like a chamber of commerce or town calendar where they have so much programming
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   that is either free or low cost or has a lottery system or tickets or things like
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.680]   that. So I was always getting in on whatever was available on those calendars.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.000]   And then I also worked a lot of really cool events.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.920]   So one of my side hustles was just being a greeter or somebody who's helping
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.840]   distributing materials for a pop up conference or a concert.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.200]   I think I saw A-Rod give a talk during a I don't even know.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.440]   I think it was like a fancy baking event.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.040]   And I was like, OK, I'm going to just stand inside.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.120]   And then at the end, I would be the person who would go pass the mic to people who
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.440]   wanted to ask their questions for him after he was done with his interview.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.560]   So I have found a lot of creative ways to access some of the things that I would
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.360]   never be able to access if I had to pay for it out of my own budget.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.600]   How did you find these side hustles?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.560]   Because I feel like, you know, it's one thing to find a way to make some extra money.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   It's another thing to find a way to make extra money while doing something that you
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.840]   otherwise could never do or like you might not even be able to buy tickets to some of
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.440]   these events or shows, even if you had the money.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.360]   So part of it really is what I was mentioning before about community.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   If you have a lot of people who are in a similar circumstance, you already have a
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.200]   network of people who have a similar need, probably a similar interest and are well
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.480]   connected enough to their own opportunities that that when, you know, another body is
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.720]   needed to cater this event that I don't know J-Lo is singing at, like you
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.280]   can get the call if you're honest and open and vulnerable enough with people to be
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.880]   like, listen, I need money right now or listen, I'm looking for work.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.080]   So I think you just honestly need to be up front about the fact that maybe you do
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.120]   need extra money or you do need side hustles or maybe you're just interested in
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.160]   certain things so that you become the person people think of and call when those
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.480]   opportunities arise.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.360]   I think the other piece of it is I really leveraged social media and this is early
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.480]   days. This is like I want to say late 2000s, early 2010s.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.440]   And so social media was a little bit different back then, but I remember I would
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.760]   post things on Facebook or I would search Facebook posts and see if people were
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.960]   around in a given city.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.880]   For example, I picked up a babysitting gig once on my day off on a tour because I was
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.880]   searching for friends who live in, I think it was Seattle.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.360]   And I searched that person's post and the person said, oh, my goodness, I'm looking
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.960]   for people who are in the Seattle area and I need them tomorrow for a babysitting
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.360]   gig. And I was like, I'm on it.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.480]   And I would also find access to opportunities that way.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.080]   So, you know, when we went to Vegas, I was like, hey, I'm headed to Vegas.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   Who do I know? And somebody was like, hey, I work at Cirque du Soleil.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.200]   Do you want free tickets?
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.600]   So I can be pretty shameless about where I am and what I need.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.960]   And that has actually served me pretty well.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.080]   That's amazing. I want to come back to one thing that you so briefly mentioned that I
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.960]   took advantage of in New York, which was all the theater lotteries.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:02.320]   So for anyone who doesn't know, almost every stage production, Broadway, off
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   Broadway, has some system, whether it's a lottery or show up and get standing room
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.960]   only tickets, where for usually and you are way more connected to the theater
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.000]   industry than me for 20 or less dollars, you can usually get tickets.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.520]   Sometimes they're the front two rows.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:24.600]   I know we've seen Wicked and Book of Mormon and Hamilton and Rent all on lottery
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   tickets where we paid, you know, 20 bucks, 30 bucks and got tickets.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   And most of them were all front row seats.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.560]   My first date with my now husband was front row Book of Mormon.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.400]   We entered the lottery two hours before the show.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.720]   We won the lottery and we got that those seats for like, yeah, 20 bucks, maybe 30
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.440]   bucks inflation. Who knows what it was, what it is now?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.560]   But it's cheap.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.600]   It's really cheap.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.400]   And my husband works on Broadway, so I get a couple extra connections through that.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.560]   But I think part of it is, again, just being willing to ask, let people know and tap
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.120]   into your own network, too.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.400]   And, you know, you mentioned the lotteries, but there's also, you know, free
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.720]   performances that come up.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.120]   And this is where the social media aspect comes in.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.440]   Hamilton was, I think, doing something where they were filming a show and they
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.600]   needed to fill the audience for the taping.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.400]   And so, you know, on their Twitter, they posted something and you could then be
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.200]   like, oh, I want that ticket.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.360]   And you like filled out the Google form and they notified you.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   But you, you know, you have to move quickly.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.280]   So part of it is just keeping on the pulse of what's going on and following the
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.880]   shows or the museums or whatever it is you want to do on Twitter.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.320]   I mean, that's a goldmine for free stuff.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.960]   Yeah. A couple other good hacks here.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.800]   So one I learned about when we were trying to see Hamilton before we got a lottery
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:57.200]   ticket was if you notice on a lot of sites like StubHub, if you're out a week, two
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.440]   weeks before the show, it's really expensive.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.760]   And then within like the last hour, everything gets really cheap because people
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.920]   are sitting on these tickets.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.000]   They're trying to make money.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.360]   And so if you just find and in New York, it's great.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.240]   Almost all the shows are right near each other.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.440]   And so what we would do is we would look like 30 minutes before and we would just
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.760]   go to like a FedEx Kinko's to print off the tickets.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.040]   This is oftentimes they're not always able to be digital.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.680]   And which is to your advantage, right?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   If they're digital, you can go to the last second.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.320]   If they're not, those last 30 minutes, people will drop the price significantly
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.640]   because they just need to sell the tickets.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.840]   So we would do that.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.760]   There's also a lot of shows and especially live tapings where I'm not sure why they
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.520]   don't charge because they seem there seems to be a lot of demand.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.160]   But we went to the Colbert report.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.600]   We went to SNL.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.480]   That kind of stuff was all free.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.880]   It's all sign up.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.200]   Usually for SNL, you sign up like a year in advance or something.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.240]   And then they just send you an email.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.600]   They're like, hey, you have two tickets to this thing.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.400]   And by the way, if you ever do go to a live taping of SNL, the way it works is
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.360]   everyone lines up in the lobby of 30 Rock and there's people that just walk through
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.440]   that line and select the people who are going to sit on the floor.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.640]   And so my wife thought I was such a crazy person because I was like, every time this
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.920]   person comes near us, let's just start laughing and let's just like be funny.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.400]   And like three times in a row, I was like, all right, now, now, now, now.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.720]   So this woman walks by and I'm just like, my wife just starts laughing.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.600]   She's like, you're an idiot.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.320]   This is so we look ridiculous.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.200]   And then the fourth time she walked by, she was like, can you two please come in
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.720]   this line?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.520]   And so we moved into the floor seat line.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.600]   So that's my my little mini hack for for getting floor seats at SNL.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.160]   But yeah, I feel like I've tried everything I can to have this awesome experience in
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.880]   cities without having to pay for it.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.840]   And if I do have to pay for it, great.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.880]   But, you know, if there's a museum you want to go to, yeah, you can pay to go to it.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.840]   And then there are like days of the month where locals are either free or I remember
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.040]   for a while, Bank of America, like if you had a Bank of America debit card, you got
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.440]   in free on a lot of days.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.680]   Check those credit card rewards.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.080]   If you have an Amex, you can do so much.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   Yeah, they used to do a lot of pre-release movies before they come out.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.640]   There are actually I don't know if this is still a thing.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.600]   Covid probably kind of tampered this down.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   But when I first moved to San Francisco, I found all these websites where you could
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.360]   sign up to go see pre-release movies and they would just all the time have free movie
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.880]   tickets to go see movies like the week before they came out.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.040]   And I always assumed they were going to ask me some survey to learn about the movie.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.840]   They never were. I have no idea what was in it for them.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.960]   But I probably went to the movie theater and saw like eight movies or 10 movies in my
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.480]   first couple of years here. Totally free.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.200]   Any other city hacks, maybe on food or anything else that you think makes makes high
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.880]   cost of living a little bit lower?
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:00.840]   I mean, I think when it comes to the necessities, one of the things I did for medical
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   care for a long time was I made use of the schools.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.200]   We have excellent schools here.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.160]   So I went to NYU Dental School and they have seriously discounted dental work that you
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.240]   can get. Even if you have health insurance, you might not have dental coverage.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.280]   So that was a big thing.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.800]   We have a lot of great clinics here, public health resources.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.560]   Again, those tend to be pretty concentrated in cities.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.240]   So that's where there's a big benefit.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.040]   Obviously, it'd be great to have benefits that you don't need that stuff.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.320]   But in case you don't, it's a good thing to have.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   And then even stuff like salon services.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   I can't remember the last time I actually paid for a haircut because there's all these
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.840]   schools here that are cosmetology schools.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.400]   So they offer free haircuts.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.640]   It's called SalonApprentice.com and it's I think it's dot com.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.840]   If you Google Salon Apprentice, you'll find it.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.880]   It's in a lot of cities.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.920]   And you can just see if like a student is looking for somebody for a cut, for a color.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.200]   If it's not free, it's super discounted.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.800]   So there's just so much of that kind of stuff where you can even take some of your
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.680]   essentials and find ways to hack them.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.560]   Yeah, I remember being at the time I remember it was like called a hair model or
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.920]   something. It's like, oh, but the only catch was for some of them, it's like, I want to
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.360]   work on this type of haircut.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.080]   So you have to make sure you don't pick someone that's like, I want to learn how to
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.520]   completely shave someone's head.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.680]   That might not be what you're looking for.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.080]   That is true, though.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.320]   I will give everybody some assurances that I have never had a horror story and I've
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.880]   probably done it 50 times.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.520]   Wow. Yeah.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.840]   And women's haircuts are much more expensive than men's haircuts.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.000]   So, yeah, to be fair, I'm not too concerned about how I look, but I do care a little
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.080]   bit. I do television.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.920]   So it is I can't look like totally out there.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:51.000]   Yeah. OK, so, you know, we very rarely talk about high cost of living hacks because
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.120]   especially in the industry, because so many of these bloggers are, you know, I read all
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.480]   these fire blogs that are like, oh, I'm trying to be financially independent.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.600]   Here's my hack so that you can live on ten thousand dollars a year.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.440]   And I'm like, OK, I don't think I've seen an apartment that goes for ten thousand
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.240]   dollars a year in all of San Francisco.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.400]   So I think it's I think it's cool that there are actually ways to make make expensive,
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   higher cost of living cities a lot cheaper.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.520]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.200]   emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.160]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.400]   Thirty seven thousand twenty five one.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.840]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.320]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.720]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.280]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system streamlining accounting, financial
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.560]   management, inventory, HR and more.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.960]   Twenty five. NetSuite turns twenty five this year.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.760]   That's twenty five years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.480]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.080]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.680]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one

[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:51.120]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.280]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.720]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.160]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:07.400]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.680]   year old tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.960]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.800]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.000]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.320]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.120]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.120]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.240]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.040]   things to drink.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.160]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.080]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more and then be happy that
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.240]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.760]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.600]   shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.880]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.640]   And these cities have a ton of value they provide.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.000]   I hate when we reduce these conversations just to the expense alone as opposed to
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.440]   thinking about what's the total value of the experience, right?
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.680]   Yeah, it costs a lot of money to live in a big city, but if it connects you to a cultural
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   circle that you care about, a community that you care about, career opportunities that
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.480]   you care about, as it does for me, as it does for my husband, who's a Broadway stage
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.360]   and like being in New York has an enormous value.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.880]   And my career would not be where it is if I did not live here.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.400]   That's not to say that you can't have really wonderful career opportunities elsewhere
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.000]   and that I may not have found success in other ways.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.600]   But I attribute so much of the income gains that I've had and the career growth that
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.920]   I've had by the sheer fact that I am in the city where it happens, in the room where it
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.680]   happens so much of the time.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   So one of the things that Covid has kind of brought up is this kind of so-called exodus
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.240]   from all of the cities.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.680]   And I know so many people that are now trying to geo arbitrage.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.720]   They're like, oh, I'm going to move to the middle of Nebraska and I'm going to work
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.680]   remotely. I'm going to make my Bay Area salary and pay Nebraska rent and it's going to
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.040]   be fantastic. And, you know, I still live in San Francisco.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.560]   You still live in New York, presumably for a similar reason to what you just described,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:53.560]   which is I believe that the career financial life upside of being in the middle of where
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.360]   an industry that you're a part of is is happening.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.360]   And I think for me, that's worth it.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.360]   And like you, I've seen a lot of benefit in the past.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.560]   Do you think that benefit keeps coming or do you think anything major has actually
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   changed in the way we work such that that value proposition is is less now in a post
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.160]   Covid world?
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.560]   There's been nothing more powerful in my career than face to face interactions, and I
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.080]   do not foresee that changing.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:25.320]   I do believe there will be more opportunity for hybrid work, for flexible work, but it
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   is really hard to recreate the experience of being in a room with somebody, not just
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:37.560]   because of just the physical interaction, but it just facilitates a night, right?
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.040]   Like, you're not just meeting for the hour that you have coffee with somebody or for
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.200]   the networking thing.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.840]   It's like, OK, let's go get dinner.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.040]   Let's go get drinks.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.160]   Let's go see a show.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.560]   And I do think that building relationships, even whether it's for personal or
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:59.200]   professional reasons, I think it requires that amount of spontaneousness.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   And I think it requires that interaction if you're going to create a level of depth.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.800]   And in my experience, it's depth of relationship that really creates the
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   opportunities that have created the most benefit for me.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.120]   Now, I'm not going to say there's no value, obviously, in having that off the grid
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.520]   lifestyle. Of course, that's high value.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.680]   And if you're in a place in your career where you feel really confident and secure
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.160]   and you don't really have much interest in pivoting into something else, great.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.400]   Go do it. But I do think there's a lot of risk that hasn't been talked about in going
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.640]   out and like living 300 miles away from wherever you are now and just assuming that
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   you're going to be stable for the rest of your life under the same conditions that
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.480]   have brought you to where you are in your career now.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.320]   Yeah, I I totally agree.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.840]   I think maybe the type of work you do could matter, I think, in in in a world where
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.480]   relationships are really important to your job, if you're in sales, like it just seems
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.760]   really important if you are an engineer and that's just what you want to do and you
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.720]   found a company and you want to work there for 10 years.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.640]   Yeah, you might be able to save a significant amount of money.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.720]   I know at least on the rent side, you could save a significant amount of money leaving
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:17.560]   the Bay Area. But if your aspiration is to start a company, if your aspiration is to
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.640]   run an entire organization or a team, I think it's I think I personally think you're
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.760]   missing out on value by being where it happens.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.520]   But I am jealous of the people who took the last two years to move somewhere else and
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.680]   just completely geo arbitrage their income while all of those room where it happens are
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.920]   closed. Let me tell you one thing about that, because I spent almost a year of my
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:48.320]   pandemic in upstate New York in a beautiful place with my family, and it was wonderful
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.840]   in many ways. I could not be happier to be back in New York City.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.360]   And I think part of this is also knowing yourself.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.400]   I think some people are more attuned to the value proposition that a city provides, and
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.520]   some people are more attuned to the opposite.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.480]   And I think sometimes we romanticize both.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.640]   And I think part of it is about getting really honest with yourself about what you care
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:17.200]   about. And at the end of the day, I care about having access to delivery and take out of
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.800]   good food 24/7.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.960]   Yes, huge value.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.760]   OK, so you just mentioned family and there's a lot of stuff I want to cover.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.000]   But a thing that I realize is I spent the last week talking with family on both sides
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.520]   about what are we doing for Thanksgiving?
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.840]   What are we doing for Christmas? And one of the things that I've heard you give advice
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   about, I think you've been on like Good Morning America talking about is gifting and the
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:46.120]   holidays. And I'm just wondering, as we approach this time of year, are there any hacks
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   you have around finding gifts for people, buying gifts, deals, shopping, any of that
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.120]   stuff that people might want to use?
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:02.200]   So I'm of the philosophy that my time and energy is not particularly well spent by going
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.840]   deep into the weeds of couponing and comparison shopping.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.480]   That said, I am interested in anything I can do that easily facilitates a discount.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.400]   So, you know, installing a browser extension that searches for deals and coupons
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:23.640]   automatically when I'm buying things online or cashback portal where you go in and it's
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   like, oh, you get five percent cash back if you shop at J.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.040]   Crew on this day and I'm shopping for J.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.200]   Crew anyway. Great.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.520]   Happy to do that.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.960]   That's pretty easy, pretty seamless, pretty low lift for an easy reward.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.120]   So that's the kind of hack that I'm interested in.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.280]   The other thing is, like, I have really no issue with opting out of things.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.640]   And I know that's very difficult for most people.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   I think a lot of holiday stuff and this is probably true for anything related to family.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.600]   You know, you're talking about family, things like weddings, things like birthdays,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.520]   anything where there's a sense of obligation, where things get emotional, where they get
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.120]   sticky. I think it's the emotional piece of it where people get really carried away.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.040]   And that's where things get out of hand.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.160]   So I think part of it has been for me just kind of interrogating what is this really
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.680]   for? What is the gifting really about?
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   What am I trying to do with the gift?
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.440]   And that has really made me realize that, like, for me, gifting and the holidays is
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.040]   about spending time with my family.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.640]   It's not about, you know, making sure that I'm partaking in the office Secret Santa
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.360]   because everyone else is doing it.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:40.520]   I can tell you that I rarely partake in any kind of ancillary gifting groups and it has
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.320]   made no difference in the quality of my network or experience.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.240]   And it's not like I'm a Grinch and, you know, I think that you all should not be doing
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.040]   this and or I'm a cheapskate.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.360]   It's just there's just not enough value that comes out of the experience.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.920]   And that sounds super cold.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:05.200]   But to me, it's like, OK, do I want to spend like fifty dollars on 10 different group
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.800]   gifting circles or do I want to buy a plane ticket so I can go visit my family?
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   That's not a difficult exchange.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.880]   I think we're just not being honest about how much of leakage there is through this
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.080]   little stuff that adds like no value.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.800]   And then also just a little soapbox, I'm very against like decor and candy of all
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.560]   kinds. Wow.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:37.240]   I just don't find that it's like this this little junk that is so expensive as it
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:44.640]   collects. And then like you have to deal with it afterwards versus like if I don't buy
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.120]   any of that, what I can do is get you.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:54.040]   I don't know, not an Apple Watch, nothing that expensive, but something like actually
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.080]   useful, maybe a subscription to like Broadway HD, because my mother loves Broadway and
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.960]   Broadway's been closed so she can stream it for the next year.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:08.800]   So again, for me, a lot of money stuff is not necessarily about the numbers so much as
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.920]   it is about the value and then like really getting clear on what's the purpose of the
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.080]   thing I'm trying to do.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.560]   And honestly, spending fifty dollars on candy canes for like a hundred different
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.400]   people is not a good value for me.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.600]   Yeah, so I've gotten in a little bit of trouble in the last few years with my family
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.960]   perspective on gifting.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.840]   I've always thought that the idea of creating a list of the things that I want and
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.400]   sending it to family and having them buy the thing on the list is like my nightmare
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.880]   because things in my world either fall into I really want them or I don't.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.040]   And if I want them, I'm going to find a way to buy them.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.600]   And a lot of times I'll buy them on Facebook Marketplace or I'll wait for them to go on
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.120]   sale and I'll use cashback portals and all this stuff.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.080]   If someone else buys them, the thing that I could have gotten for thirty bucks, they're
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.000]   paying fifty dollars.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.360]   And that drives me crazy.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.120]   The other thing that drives me crazy is everyone's always asking like a month out.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.840]   They're like, what do you want?
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.480]   So then you go do some research and you're like, well, here's seven things that I want
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.160]   to buy. Now I just want them.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.920]   So it's like the whole gifting for me got so stressful because I'd find a thing that I
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.760]   finally like, yes, I want this shirt.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.200]   And then it's like now I've got to wait five weeks to have the shirt and I know you're
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.520]   going to overpay for the shirt.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:27.240]   And all I really wanted was like some kind of gift that was meaningful.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.520]   Like I care much less about the fact that you're willing to spend fifty dollars on me
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.560]   than I do that you spent a little bit of time trying to find something that you thought
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.520]   would be cool. And so I proposed that.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.680]   We just do away with lists and everyone thought that was crazy.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.840]   And so then I went one step to the extreme to try to make my point.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.400]   And this is where it kind of went off the rails.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.920]   I said, look, if we're all just going to buy each other things off each other's lists,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.680]   what if we just made a spreadsheet and we all typed in how much we were going to spend
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.720]   on each other? And then we just netted it out.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.880]   So if you were willing to spend eighty dollars on me and I was willing to spend seventy
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.440]   dollars on you, you could just Venmo me ten dollars and we just call it a day.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.560]   And they're like, well, that takes the fun out of it.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.520]   And I was like, I know, but it's already not fun.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.560]   Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.240]   But I told, of course, it didn't go well.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.800]   I totally get it. You know what I wish for gifts?
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.160]   I wish I could buy gifts when I see something and I'm like, oh, that's perfect for
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.880]   so-and-so. And that's it.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.560]   I don't buy them any other gifts any other time.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.720]   I just get the thing when I'm like, oh, that is the thing for this person.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.960]   So that's so when you talk about opting out, it's interesting.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.120]   We finally got to a place with families that, you know, we don't see both sides of the
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.720]   family for Christmas every year.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.760]   So we just said, hey, look, on the years that we're not going to see you guys, we're
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.480]   opting out and everyone actually opted out.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.760]   So we just don't do gifts there.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.240]   And then on the years that we do, we actually just have a there's my wife has two
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.720]   sisters and parents.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.560]   So there's four kind of groups.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.760]   We just everyone gets one person.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.560]   We get them one gift and like we call it a day, except for kids.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.000]   Everyone under like 10 is opted in every year.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.040]   The kids get some gifts because it's exciting.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.240]   But all the adults have kind of gotten to a point that they opted out, which has
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.880]   actually worked incredibly well.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:18.960]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a great
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.760]   addition to your New Year routine.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.360]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.000]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.880]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.640]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.160]   from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.360]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.160]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.760]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.640]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.760]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.280]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.760]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.840]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.440]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.960]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:30.000]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   your cooking at home?
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.440]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.800]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.640]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.960]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.600]   this episode.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.480]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.400]   in the microwave.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.120]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.160]   simplifies the process so much.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.000]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.400]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.760]   too.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.000]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.040]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.440]   It is so good.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.240]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.040]   year, you have to check it out.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.760]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.200]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.280]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.120]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.120]   to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.520]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.040]   I was going to ask you how you are feeling about navigating all this now as a
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.720]   parent, because I do not have children, but I think it would make me crazy if
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.400]   people kept buying my kid just garbage.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.560]   So the number of gifts we've already thrown out is like, I can't count on my
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.680]   hand because everyone's like, "Oh, I sent you this thing."
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.840]   And it's like, we got this one stuffed animal and it was like covered in like
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.080]   this smelly glitter.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.520]   And it just seemed like it was the cheapest thing ever.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.920]   And if someone put it in their mouth, they would probably get some toxic
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.560]   chemical.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.320]   And so I do think that, you know, registries for kids is one of these
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.720]   hysterical things where you're like, "Here are the 20 things we need for our
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.040]   kid."
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.280]   And they're like, "I'm so glad you sent that list.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.040]   I got you this other thing that I thought you would want."
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.760]   And I'm like, "No, if I wanted it, I would have put it on the list."
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.160]   Every now and then, it's a really cool sentimental thing, but for the most
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.920]   part, they're not.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:56.600]   But your dream is something my wife and I have decided, which is we no longer do
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.880]   birthday and Christmas gifts for each other.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.320]   We just, throughout the year, when we see something really exciting for each
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.160]   other, we buy it and we just have random gifts.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.560]   It's like, "Hey, we're at dinner."
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.200]   And I'm like, "I saw this book.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.000]   I thought you'd love it."
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.760]   And a cool book that I will actually share, which I think is really cool, is
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.560]   this website or book or company called Adventure Challenge.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:23.120]   So the whole premise is you get this book and it's like 50 dates, but you
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.160]   don't know what they are and you have to scratch them off and you commit to doing
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   them and they give you some requirements.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.520]   So it's like, "Tonight, you're going to need two hours.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   It needs to be dark out and you need 30 bucks."
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.440]   And then you just see this thing and you're like, "All right, you're ready?
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.240]   We're going to scratch this off and that's the date."
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.960]   So that was a recent gift and we've only gone on one date and it sent us to Target
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.480]   to make like little scrapbooks for each other with stickers.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.440]   It was like, it sounded like the dumbest thing ever.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.840]   And then we did it and we went to like a bar and got some beers and we were
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.040]   like putting these stickers in.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.520]   We felt like we were designing our trapper keepers back in the day.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.880]   But I shout out to Adventure Challenge because I thought that was a really
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.160]   fun gift that keeps on giving, I guess.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.240]   I love that.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:10.280]   I've also taken to having the best gifting experience with my husband,
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.960]   which at this point is really just treating ourselves to extravagant meals
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.680]   and trips.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.000]   And I honestly, if that's what gifting was, I would be much happier.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.760]   Yes.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   I think we both share that love for travel.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.200]   Okay.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.000]   So we haven't talked at all about the biggest thing that I think you're
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.400]   working on right now, or maybe there's multiple, but you know, last, in the
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:36.720]   middle of the pandemic, you started a podcast and it was something that I don't
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.080]   think I'd really seen recently, which was talking to people kind of off the
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.200]   record, confidentially about their money issues and trying to solve them.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.960]   And so I'd love to hear a little bit about how that came together and some of
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   the interesting things you've been learning that maybe you were surprised by.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.800]   So the podcast is produced in partnership, well, it's their podcast.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.160]   It's Real Simple Magazine.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.840]   And so they hired me as the host and I'm a producer on the show.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.200]   And they basically had this idea of, we really want to talk to people
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.120]   confidentially about their money problem and then have an expert come on and
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.800]   explain how to solve the problem.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.840]   And that's the framework they gave me.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.640]   And I was like, Hmm, this could go so many ways.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.200]   How are we going to really bring it together?
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.800]   And one of the things that I've found in doing the actual interviews and seeing
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.000]   what brings it together is that it's almost never about the money.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.560]   It's almost always about the feelings about the money, the shame, the fear,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:51.440]   the everything else, the family, the friend, the husband, the wife, you know.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:59.080]   And almost every single person thinks they are totally alone and it makes them
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.440]   feel like they're a failure.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.600]   Everybody else around them is succeeding and they are hopeless.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.920]   And so they internalize whatever they're going through as this experience of,
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.960]   Oh, it's just me as an identity.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.240]   I am bad with money and that is who I am.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.280]   And that is just a quality that I must have been born with or inherited from my
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:22.800]   family.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   And thus, there is no hope.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.120]   And that is a really painful place to try to make a positive change from.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.960]   You can't really hack your way out of that.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.400]   You know, we talk about optimizing these things, using the deal sites and trying
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.480]   to set these boundaries of people in our lives.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.440]   But if you are in a place where you don't even think it's possible for you to
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:51.040]   change, if you're saying I'm bad with money, not I've made a money mistake,
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.640]   that's a really hard place to move forward from.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:59.880]   And so on the show, when we're talking to people and we bring on the experts, not
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.040]   only do we have to go into the hacks of like, OK, here's what this means for your
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.400]   spreadsheet and here's what this means for your budget and your investment
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.680]   account and your savings account.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.480]   We also have to go into, well, here's what this means for your relationship to
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.080]   your mother or here's what this means for your relationship to yourself.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.440]   And it is really emotional.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   And I don't say that to say that we're trying to be a kind of therapy podcast.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.200]   We're not. But I notice when it's confidential, people start to open up about
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.360]   what's really behind why the numbers on the page aren't adding up.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.080]   And when people do that, you really just start to see how much of it is about shame
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.040]   and isolation and how much can really be helped by having these conversations that
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.600]   you and I are having, where we're like, I actually hate this thing that we all do.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.960]   You know, maybe we should change that, because if you don't have that
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.240]   conversation, you continue to feel obligated and you continue to feel overstretched
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   and you continue to get trapped in this cycle where nothing's working out for you.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.800]   So I think the coolest thing about the show has just been really talking to the
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.160]   listeners themselves and seeing what they've been willing to be vulnerable about
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.480]   and, like, realize for themselves in the process of sharing what's going on.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.120]   Because a lot of it is these aha moments that they never thought about before.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.320]   They never thought about, oh, well, why isn't this working?
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.840]   Then, you know, the budget's not working.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.160]   But as they talk it out, you can hear them start to have these aha moments.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.000]   And that's super cool.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.480]   Can you walk through an example of an interview you've done and kind of some of
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   the learnings you've had?
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.520]   Yeah, we had one listener on the show who called in and she said, you know, I'm
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:44.040]   really struggling to figure out how to plan for the future with my boyfriend because,
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.560]   you know, I make 30 percent more than he does.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.760]   Oh, no, it wasn't 30 percent more.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.520]   It's $30,000 more than he does.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.200]   Just a significant income difference.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.560]   And she was in her mid-20s.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.920]   They were both in their mid-20s.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.640]   And presumably that difference could grow a lot more in the future.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.840]   And so she's like, you know, I just can't seem to figure out how we're going to
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.800]   make it work.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:13.520]   And what I realized in talking to her and having her talk through how they were
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   managing the expenses, what did it look like when the paychecks came in, what did
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   the conversations look like around dividing expenses up, was all of their
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.960]   conversations were based on the premise that fair is 50/50 and there is nothing
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:37.000]   else. And it was just an interesting assumption that equal is same.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.320]   And that is not necessarily true.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.400]   You know, what does equal mean in a relationship?
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.160]   It sounds like a super heavy topic.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   But if you've never really interrogated that, then you can't make a good financial
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.960]   plan for your relationship because the fact is almost nothing is ever 50/50 in the
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   course of not just a moment in time, but certainly over the course of a marriage
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.560]   that could potentially be 20, 30, 40 years.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.240]   And so that's an example of something that it starts with, like this really simple
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.960]   thing. It's like, well, how do we split our rent?
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.480]   You know, I make $30,000 more than he does.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.640]   But then if you kind of strip away all the layers, what it's really about is like,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.560]   oh, well, I've been conditioned to think that like what it means to to be an
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.320]   empowered woman in a relationship is that, you know, it's equal 50/50.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.720]   And I'm making more.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.280]   So what does that mean now that I'm the breadwinner?
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.240]   And where do my thoughts about this come from?
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.560]   And why is it creating resentment?
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.200]   And why is this now a point of tension in our every day?
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.520]   And so it's just like really wild to see what comes up when you keep digging behind
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.720]   the layers and asking more questions.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.840]   And what's the advice for someone like that?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.760]   Is it to just talk about it?
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.880]   Is it, you know, how do you get past it?
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.280]   Is it just, you know, it doesn't have to be 50/50.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:07.080]   So a lot of the money stuff is like what it's not about the money stuff again, like
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.560]   always comes back to everything else.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.600]   It's like, OK, what is your perception of what it means to be fair?
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.840]   What is the model of behavior you experienced growing up?
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:24.320]   Was it that your parent told you that you had to do everything and provide for
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   everyone? Was it that it's a bad thing if you're a woman and you make more money than
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:34.000]   your spouse? And so, you know, you should feel somehow ashamed if you're in that
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.560]   position. These might not be things that were explicitly said to you, but these are
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   also things that you might need to stop and go through those memory banks to be like,
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.000]   wait, what are these kind of models of behavior I either witnessed growing up or the
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.800]   messages I got, whether they were explicit or maybe like maybe not so explicit, but
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:57.000]   you felt it. And then you have to talk about those things with your partner because
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.040]   you both had totally different experiences growing up.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.880]   And so you are not going to match perfectly with your finances because you have had
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.680]   completely different outlooks.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.840]   You have had completely different histories.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.120]   You had completely different models of behavior.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:18.040]   And the only way to really get on the same page about what is fair is to kind of
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.560]   interrogate all of those things together.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.600]   And it's really uncomfortable to do that, especially when you're dating, because,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.120]   you know, you don't want to sit down on the first date and be like, you know, tell
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.760]   me your entire family history with money and your credit score and your debt load.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.320]   You know, that's not the answer.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:38.080]   But the answer is, right, the answer is, though, that like you can't lean out of that
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.840]   conversation entirely until you're after a legally, like financially obligated to
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.800]   somebody in a marriage, which is unfortunately, I think what happens a lot.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:51.240]   Yeah, I saw on your website a guide of 25 talks to have with your partner about money.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.040]   So I'm going to link to that in the show notes, because I imagine that would help a
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.640]   lot of people get past these things.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.600]   It does. And it also kind of lays out at what point in the relationship to do these
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   things, because, again, you don't want to be that person on the first date asking
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.440]   about, you know, student loan balances.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.720]   Yeah. I mean, this isn't money related, but something I found was when we had our
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.640]   daughter, my wife doesn't have the same last name as me.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.920]   And, you know, that was something that didn't matter to me.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.320]   But she was kind of like, are you sure?
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.560]   Are you OK? And I'm like, yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.760]   So then we have to pick what our daughter's last name is.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.240]   And for most people, it's just like assumed.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.640]   And I think for me, I was like, well, you have a cooler last name, like your last
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.400]   name's Fox. That's a pretty cool name.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.840]   We should give our daughter that name.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:42.440]   And it was just surprising how many people were like blown away by the fact that we
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.320]   gave our daughter my wife's last name, so much so that some people either chose to
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.440]   ignore it or didn't know or just assumed.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.480]   And they'd like sent her like, you know, a monogrammed pillow with the wrong
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.880]   initials and that kind of stuff, as if, you know.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.720]   And so I just realized that her assumption of what we would do and my assumption of
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.880]   what we would do weren't even on the same page.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.680]   And when we talked about it, it was like, oh, OK, she'll have, you know, and mine's a
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.720]   little more systematic.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.120]   I personally, I really struggle with hyphenated names because I'm like, well, if
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.200]   we give all our kids hyphenated names, then all our kids are going to get married to
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.600]   other kids with hyphenated names.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.880]   Then they're going to have quadruple hyphenated names.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.480]   And then their kids are going to have eight last names and so on and so on.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.800]   So mine's more like a process and system argument for not doing that.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.880]   But I think my wife also just has a much cooler last name.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.800]   And I slightly regret not taking her last name because I feel like Chris Fox, like
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.080]   would just be a much better podcast host, much better name on the billboard, all
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.480]   those things. I mean, it's never too late.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:49.760]   So one of a few things that you touched on in that conversation was about, you know,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.840]   you talk to this woman who makes more than her husband.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.680]   And I know you've been spending a lot of time digging into the data that comes
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:02.960]   around. And by data, I mean studies, research with women who make more than their
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.120]   husbands try to be too ambitious.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.720]   And you've even kind of coined the term "the ambition penalty." Could you talk a
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.440]   little bit about what you've been learning and what you've been sharing?
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.840]   And we'll go from there.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.240]   Yeah, so I got really interested in a lot of the advice that we have been giving
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.680]   women in particular in order to close these really persistent gaps in pay, in
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:33.560]   wealth, in leadership, in workforce representation, because I think in the last
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.240]   decade or so, you've seen a lot of the Instagrammable advice of like, OK, just
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.800]   speak up, just be more aggressive, just ask for more, just negotiate.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:49.480]   And I wanted to challenge the assumption that women were not doing those things.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.320]   And what happened is when I looked into the data, what I found is women actually
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.920]   are doing a lot of these things.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.360]   They are asking for more.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.480]   They are speaking up.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.760]   They are trying to reach leadership positions.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:07.520]   But what happens is when women engage in these behaviors, there is a backlash to
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.920]   the behavior. So there's a lot of studies that look at, for example, a resume.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.640]   And what happens if you change the name from a Howard to a Heidi is if you have
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.120]   all of the same qualifications, if you have all of the same perceptions otherwise
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:31.360]   other than the name, then the Howard is more likely to be judged favorably compared
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:37.040]   to the Heidi, who not only is she less likely to be judged favorably, if the cover
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:43.400]   letter is seen as somehow aggressive or self-advocating, then she's actually likely
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.840]   to get a backlash.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.520]   She's likely to be labeled unlikable.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.280]   And this isn't just about likability.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.440]   This has real tangible financial consequences.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.800]   In fact, on one episode of Money Confidential, I interviewed a woman who was
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.880]   negotiating her salary after getting a job offer, and the job offer was rescinded as
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.400]   a result. So they withdrew the job offer.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:15.400]   That is a tangible financial penalty that woman got for trying to negotiate a raise.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.280]   And that is not an anomaly.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.840]   This has been borne out in the data.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.040]   And that's just one example, a job offer being rescinded.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.120]   This happens when women try to get promotions, reach leadership positions.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.320]   There's all of this backlash, and a lot of it has a tangible cost.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:39.200]   And my takeaway in covering this is not that, well, we should just not negotiate or we
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.120]   should just not try to reach these leadership positions or whatever else it is.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:50.280]   My takeaway is we need to broaden the conversation so that it's not so overly
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.600]   simplistic, because when you say, oh, just speak up, just be more confident, just be
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.840]   more assertive, the assumption is that somehow we're not already doing these things
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.240]   and that getting to pay equity is as simple as that.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.280]   And the truth is, it's not that simple.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.360]   It's being borne out in the data that it's not that simple.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.920]   And it also puts so much of the onus on women, especially women of color, basically
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:24.320]   anyone who's, you know, outside of the gender binary to be the person who's going to
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.880]   solve for what's really a structural inequity.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.080]   And so I think for all of us who are trying to navigate in this world, we need to have a
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.280]   broader conversation about how do we recognize these biases and then how do we
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:41.400]   manage them in the context of these conversations of negotiating, getting
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.800]   leadership positions, leaning in, all of that.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.280]   So.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:51.360]   I mean, it's fascinating that a lot of times I hear these stories, but I've never dug
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.520]   into it, so you've actually linked out to a lot of different studies that show what's
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:01.160]   happening. And I went deep on a couple of them and like, you know, the Journal of
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.400]   Psychology and that kind of stuff.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.720]   What do you think someone listening today and especially for me, right, I'm on the
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.280]   other side of of the gender here.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.960]   What can I start doing to make this better?
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.800]   Is it as simple as just talking about it?
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.120]   What can happen at work?
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.840]   What can we do to promote an environment that kind of makes this I mean, it's not
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   going to go away overnight, but kind of works on making this go away.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:32.120]   I think talking about it is actually more powerful than we might think it is,
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.720]   because as we kind of talked about earlier, a lot of this stuff isn't explicit.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.640]   Nobody is out there being like, we don't want women to be leaders.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.240]   We don't we want to suppress the ambitions of minorities.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.560]   Nobody is saying that.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.520]   But this stuff is really deep.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.560]   It's structural.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.400]   And so part of it is really just bringing awareness to the ways in which we do
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.960]   undermine women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals when they do advocate for
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.440]   themselves. And if you see it happening, you know, if you're in a position of power
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.000]   to go ahead and say something, that means something.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.720]   If you can support that person through the process of a negotiation and be their
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.400]   mentor, be their advocate, that means something.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.520]   I think part of this, too, especially in personal finance world, is that we have to
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.320]   do better. Me, myself included, I have given that advice of, you know, be more
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.760]   confident. But that is really insulting to just imply that confidence alone is going
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.480]   to solve for what is really a structural and systemic inequity.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:44.440]   And so I think we have to say, OK, you know, if we see a little gap in how much men
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.760]   and women are negotiating, maybe we should interrogate why.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.960]   What is going on there?
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.720]   Is it because women aren't confident or is it because they have a realistic and
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.920]   borne out fear of backlash?
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.960]   It's not just a lack of confidence.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:07.640]   It's a real legitimate and borne out, proven fear that if I do this, I'm going to be
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.600]   labeled aggressive. I'm going to be labeled unlikable.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:16.400]   They're going to say I'm not a great fit for this company the next time that I'm in
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   the running for a promotion.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.280]   So I think part of it is really about just interrogating the assumptions we have
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.000]   around a lot of the career and financial advice that we are giving to these
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.920]   historically marginalized communities.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:38.640]   Are there any tactics that someone in one of these communities can use to try to
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:43.920]   lighten or reduce the likelihood that they face this backlash?
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:52.400]   Yeah, so a lot of this, you know, in my research around why this is happening, that
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:57.520]   part of it stems from our expectations around how certain communities are, quote
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.080]   unquote, supposed to act.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:05.280]   And historically speaking, women are, quote unquote, supposed to act in a way that is
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.880]   deferential, that is serving, that is nurturing of the community.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.160]   And men are supposed to, quote unquote, act in this way that is, you know,
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.840]   aggressive and being the provider.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:22.400]   And so basically what happens is when a woman asserts the qualities that we
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:28.600]   associate with, you know, heteronormative masculinity, this isn't typically a
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.720]   conscious thing. But subconsciously, there's this feeling of like, oh, you
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.560]   know, that's just like a little bit too much.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.880]   You know, there's just a little bit not the right fit.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.400]   And we have this instinctive reaction around like, we don't like this person because
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.280]   they're not conforming to this expectation of how we think they should behave.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:56.520]   And so what we can do as people managing these biases, if you're a woman and, you
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:02.640]   know, you know that you're in a company where maybe there's some bias and
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:08.320]   discrimination you've seen firsthand, maybe you can think, OK, so I know that I'm
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.360]   in an environment where there is a lot of this bias.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:17.640]   What is it that I can do to advocate for myself in a way that's not going to be
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:23.040]   seen as I'm the bitch or difficult or whatever for just engaging in these very
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.320]   basic self-advocacy behaviors?
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:31.720]   So what I can do is frame my ambition through the net benefit to the
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:37.920]   organization. So, for example, if I'm saying if what I really want is a raise,
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.440]   what I can do is instead of, you know, framing what I think I should get a raise
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.640]   for through just me and my contributions, I can also frame it through the
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:57.000]   perspective of what this work has done to benefit the community, the people around
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.520]   me, the company, and really play more into that, you know, traditional nurturing
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.840]   vibe, even as you're doing this self-advocacy that might be seen as more
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.280]   masculine, if that makes sense.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.000]   No, it makes total sense.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.880]   So there is so much we could keep going.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.080]   I actually have a bunch of questions that I'll save for the next conversation.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.560]   But where can people who want to see some of this data and want to learn more
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.320]   about what you're learning find everything you're doing?
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.200]   Yeah, so I've been writing a lot more in detail about the ambition penalty and
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.560]   sharing these firsthand accounts that women have had on my bulletin, which is a
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.520]   newsletter service, which you can find at ambition.bulletin.com.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.720]   We'll link to that in the show notes and anything else that you're working on
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.520]   online or anywhere that people should look for.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.960]   Yeah, you can listen to our Money Confidential podcast wherever you're
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.440]   listening to this podcast and hear some, you know, not just experts, but real
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.520]   people sharing the real stories and like a lot of the interesting emotions and
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.880]   stories behind those numbers on the page, which I always find fascinating.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.560]   Yeah, I've been listening.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.520]   It's fantastic.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.040]   Stephanie, thank you so much for joining.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.760]   What a fun time.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.440]   Thank you.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Wow.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.840]   I always have so much fun talking with Stephanie and I hope you all enjoyed the
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840]   conversation too.

[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.280]   Speaking of which, if you tuned into the last Q&A episode, I'd love to know what
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.040]   you think.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.720]   So please shoot me a quick note and let me know if you want to see more or less
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720]   episodes like that.

[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.680]   All right, that's it for now.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.800]   See you next week.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:10.960]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.520]   money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.120]   retirement.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.280]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.160]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.240]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.520]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.840]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.560]   entertaining.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.680]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.800]   listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.240]   mind.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.200]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.800]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.440]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.400]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.200]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.640]   your money and grow your wealth.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.800]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.200]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.840]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
