[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   I believe that in America, no student should ever be denied full access to the maximum
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840]   opportunities of education, merely because they were born in a family that was too poor
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.200]   to afford it.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.680]   There is no price too high, no sacrifice too great!
