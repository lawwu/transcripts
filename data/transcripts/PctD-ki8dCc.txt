[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.300]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.640]   Today, my guest is Dr. David Spiegel.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400]   Dr. Spiegel is the Associate Chair
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.260]   of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.440]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.840]   He is also the Director of the Stanford Center
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.620]   on Stress and Health.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.540]   Dr. Spiegel is both a researcher
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.160]   and a clinician, meaning he runs a laboratory
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.680]   that studies the brain and the body
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   and neural mechanisms of how the brain and body interact.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.640]   And he sees patients as a psychiatrist at Stanford.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.480]   His work is incredibly unique
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.320]   in that it bridges mind and body,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.360]   but it also has a particular focus
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.080]   on the clinical applications of hypnosis.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.280]   As you'll learn today, hypnosis is a unique brain state
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.200]   in which neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.880]   in response to experience, may be heightened.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.540]   And indeed, the use of clinical hypnosis
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.800]   by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues has been shown
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.240]   to improve symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.740]   chronic pain, and various other illnesses,
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.480]   including many psychiatric illnesses
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.440]   and even outcomes in cancer.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560]   Today, we discuss hypnosis in the context
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.540]   of what's called self-hypnosis
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.180]   to distinguish it from stage hypnosis.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.580]   Many of you are probably familiar with stage hypnosis,
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.260]   which is really about a hypnotist getting a person
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440]   to do things they would not otherwise do.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.360]   In contrast, clinical hypnosis and the use of hypnosis
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.020]   for the treatment of various ailments of mind and body
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.420]   is vastly different.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.680]   It involves getting people to change their brain state
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.080]   and to use that brain state as a portal
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   to make adjustments in their brain and body
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.080]   and other aspects of their biology and psychology
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.360]   that benefit them.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.320]   And it's been shown over and over again
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.540]   in studies by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.560]   that those changes can occur extremely quickly.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.700]   Now, not everybody can be hypnotized as readily as the next.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.760]   And so today we also discuss a simple test developed
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   by Dr. Spiegel that can help you determine
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   whether or not you have a high, medium or low degree
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   of what we call hypnotizability.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.640]   Dr. Spiegel is truly an expert in this area.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.720]   He has published over 480 journal articles,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.920]   170 book chapters on hypnosis
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.860]   and on things like psychosocial oncology,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.600]   which is the interaction of mind and body
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.040]   in the treatment of cancer and cancer outcomes,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   on stress physiology, trauma
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.800]   and other aspects of psychotherapy.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.680]   He's published 13 books.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   So he's truly the world expert in hypnosis
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   and clinical applications of hypnosis for mind and body.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.800]   I'm certain that in listening to today's episode,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880]   you're going to learn a tremendous amount
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.080]   about how the brain and body interact,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.380]   about various treatments for all sorts of common ailments
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.640]   of mind and body.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.500]   And you're going to get access to tools,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.560]   in particular, a tool that was developed by Dr. Spiegel,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.060]   which is the Reveri app, R-E-V-E-R-I.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.700]   The Reveri app is currently only available for Apple,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.600]   but will soon also be available for Android.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   It does carry a nominal cost,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.980]   but there is a seven day free trial.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.820]   If you'd like to try it,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.920]   we're providing a link in the show notes.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.320]   The Reveri app is special in that it is based
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.660]   on clinical studies and research done
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.800]   in the Spiegel lab at Stanford.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.120]   So unlike a lot of hypnosis apps out there
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   and resources for hypnosis,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.940]   it was developed with clinical treatments in mind.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.420]   Today, we also discussed the use of breath work.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.060]   And I'm very fortunate that my research lab at Stanford
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.600]   has been collaborating very closely with Dr. Spiegel
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.920]   in testing and developing specific breath work protocols
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.560]   to adjust mind and body for things like anxiety,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.660]   improving mood and improving sleep.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.320]   Based on his incredible and unique expertise
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   and the clarity with which Dr. Spiegel
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.580]   communicates information,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.240]   I anticipate that you will really enjoy today's episode
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.680]   and that you'll come away from it
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.960]   with a lot of actionable tools.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.420]   Some of you might be curious what a clinical hypnosis
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.080]   session looks like.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.660]   And for that reason, we had Dr. Spiegel hypnotize me.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.160]   A clip of that hypnosis session is going to be posted
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.580]   to the Huberman Lab Clips channel,
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.340]   which is available on YouTube.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.020]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.860]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.880]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.480]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.300]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.340]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.680]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.280]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.660]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.140]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.880]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.780]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.320]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   once or twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.840]   vitamin mineral probiotic needs.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.940]   There is now ample evidence that probiotics
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.460]   can be very helpful for supporting
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.800]   what is called the gut microbiome.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.180]   The gut microbiome is an aspect of our biology
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.720]   in which little gut microbiota live
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   all along our digestive pathway
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   and help support various aspects of our biology,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.160]   including our immune system, our metabolic system,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.000]   our hormones or endocrine system,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.480]   as well as what's called the gut brain axis,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.960]   which is literally communication between the gut
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   and the brain to support things like mood, motivation,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.020]   and various other aspects of brain health.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.200]   With Athletic Greens, I get the probiotics
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.760]   that I need to support a healthy gut microbiome
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.440]   and the vitamins and minerals tap off any deficiencies
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.760]   I might have based on lack of certain foods
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.840]   and lack of certain nutrients in my diet.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.180]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.760]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.240]   to claim a special offer.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.200]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.960]   There's a lot of evidence now that vitamin D3
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.040]   is critically important for various aspects
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.640]   of immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.920]   And while many people get enough vitamin D3,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.200]   many people do not.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.860]   So the year supply of vitamin D3 ought to be very useful
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.880]   for many people.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.420]   And K2 has been shown to be important for calcium regulation,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.560]   various aspects of metabolic health and so forth.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.760]   So again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.080]   and get that special offer, the five free travel packs
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.160]   and year supply of vitamin D3, K2,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.040]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.920]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.060]   Nootropic is a smart drug.
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.600]   And personally, I'm not a big fan of the concept
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.520]   of a smart drug, at least not the way
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.740]   that most people talk about smart drugs or nootropics,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.780]   for the following reason.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.980]   Being smart involves various things.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.960]   There is creativity, there's focus,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.920]   there's task switching and so on.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.280]   And each one of those involves different operations
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.720]   in the brain, different neural circuits,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.240]   different neurochemicals have to be deployed
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.780]   in order for us to, for instance, be very focused
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.500]   or for us to be very creative
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.780]   or for us to be able to switch tasks easily.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.080]   Thesis understands this.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.440]   And for that reason, they've developed custom nootropics
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.960]   that are aimed at getting your brain and body
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.420]   into particular states for particular types
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.320]   of work or physical activity.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.480]   In order to accomplish that,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.080]   they've created unique blends of high quality ingredients.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   And each of those blends is designed to get your brain
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.960]   and body into a particular mode, such as focus,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.640]   clarity, or motivation.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.720]   I've been using Thesis nootropics for over six months now.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.740]   And I have to say, it's been a total game changer
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.480]   and very unique from the experience of using
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.520]   sort of what I call catch all nootropics.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.280]   So with Thesis, it's really directed
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.360]   toward particular brain body states.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.860]   I should also mention that they tailor
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.520]   those custom blends to you.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.320]   So by taking a quiz on their site,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.680]   they will tailor the blend to you and your specific needs
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.020]   and the things you don't want.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.120]   So if you want to try your own
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.620]   personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.260]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.520]   You'll take a three minute quiz
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.560]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.800]   to try in your first month.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.760]   And then based on the outcomes with those,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.880]   they can update your formulations for you.

[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.820]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.000]   that I believe are of the utmost quality.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   The company was founded by two all American swimmers
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.080]   from Stanford and everything about the design
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.100]   of Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.600]   was created with performance in mind.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.360]   There are a number of things about Roka sunglasses
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.380]   and eyeglasses that I particularly like.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   First of all, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.120]   You basically forget that you're wearing them.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.200]   Second of all, you can wear them for work,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.740]   for going out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.840]   They have great aesthetics, so you can wear them anywhere,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.500]   but also for exercise.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.320]   You can wear them when running or cycling.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.760]   And even if you get sweaty,
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.040]   they're designed so that they don't slip off your face.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.860]   Another terrific feature of Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.800]   is that they were designed with the biology
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.720]   of the visual system in mind.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.880]   We all have the experience of being in a shaded area
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.960]   and then going to a bright area.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.080]   It takes some time for your eyes to adjust or to adapt.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.060]   Many sunglasses make it hard to see
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.840]   as you move from one environment to the next
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.240]   and therefore you have to take on and off your sunglasses.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.300]   With Roka sunglasses, you don't have to do that.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.600]   You don't even notice the transitions
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.760]   between those bright areas and those dimmer areas.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.440]   So you can wear them anywhere, anytime.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.960]   And again, most of the time you don't even realize
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.320]   that they're on your face.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.920]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,

[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.240]   And now for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.160]   David, thank you so much for being here.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.360]   - Andrew, my pleasure.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.300]   - Can you tell us what is hypnosis?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.880]   - Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.160]   It's something like looking through the telephoto lens
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080]   of a camera in consciousness.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.880]   What you see, you see with great detail,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.300]   but devoid of context.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.080]   If you've had the experience of getting so caught up
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.380]   in a good movie that you forget you're watching a movie
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.520]   and enter the imagined world, you're part of the movie,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.080]   you're not part of the audience, you're experiencing it,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.520]   you're not evaluating it, that's a hypnotic like experience
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.240]   that many people have in their everyday lives.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.000]   - So is any experience that really draws us in hypnotic
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.840]   in that sense, or let me give a different example.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   If I'm watching a sports game
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.720]   and I'm really wrapped up in the game,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.760]   but I'm also in touch with how it makes me feel in my body,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.920]   kind of registering the excitement or the anticipation,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   is that a state of hypnosis also?
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.640]   Because you mentioned there's kind of a narrowing
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.000]   of context, but a kind of losing of the self.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.880]   Or do I have that right?
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.800]   - Yes, it is true that to the extent that your somatic,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.100]   your body experience is a part of the sport event
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.680]   that you're engaged with,
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.660]   I'd say that is a self-altering hypnotic experience.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.580]   If your physical reactions are distracting you
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.820]   or make you think about something else,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.700]   that's when it's less hypnotic like
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.360]   and more just one of a series of experiences.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.180]   - Okay, so I have to ask,
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.300]   how did you get into this business of hypnosis?
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.980]   Because I think for most people,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.780]   when they hear hypnosis or they think about hypnosis,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.660]   they think of stage hypnosis.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.140]   I think of somebody with a pendant going back and forth
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.500]   or people up on a stage,
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.640]   behaving abnormally for the entertainment of others.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.120]   How did you get into hypnosis as an interest, as a practice?
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.140]   And if you would, could you contrast the sort of hypnosis
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.020]   that you do in the clinical setting
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.940]   with the sort of hypnosis that a stage hypnotist does?
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.060]   - Sure.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.780]   Well, it is something of a genetic illness in my family.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.460]   Both of my parents were psychiatrists and psychoanalysts.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.140]   And they told me I was free to be any kind of psychiatrist
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.580]   I wanted to be, so here I am.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.900]   My father was training to be a psychoanalyst in 1943.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:49.900]   And he ran into a Viennese refugee
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.960]   who couldn't serve in the army,
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.420]   but who had studied hypnosis.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   And actually, it would interest you
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.500]   in doing your ophthalmological research.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.020]   He had a smallpox scar right in the middle of his forehead,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.820]   and he did forensic examinations.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.000]   And he noticed that some of the prisoners
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.740]   would focus on that spot on his forehead
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.000]   and then close their eyes and seem to go to sleep,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.020]   but they were in some altered state.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.740]   So he got interested in hypnosis.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.660]   He used it forensically.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.520]   His name was Gustav von Aschaffenburg.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.260]   And he offered to teach young psychiatrists
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.620]   how to use hypnosis when they went off into the war.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.940]   And so he trained my father.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.660]   And my father got off the analytic couch
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.680]   and asked, the analyst mentioned it to him.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   That's how he found out about it.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.400]   And my father said, "Did I say something wrong in analysis?
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.760]   "Why is he talking to me now?"
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.040]   And he found it very useful in helping soldiers
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.240]   who had acute pain when they were wounded
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.860]   and helping people with conversion
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.980]   post-traumatic stress disorders.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.500]   And when he came back, he went back to his training,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.460]   but he still was sort of interested in it.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.920]   And one of his supervisors was Frieda Fromreichmann,
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.560]   who was a very famous psychoanalyst.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.360]   And he said that he had been told to stop doing hypnosis
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.180]   because it would ruin his reputation as an analyst.
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.900]   And she said to him, "What are you so worried
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.580]   "about your reputation for?
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.340]   "You're gonna give a course at the Institute in hypnosis,
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.560]   "and I know you're gonna do it because I'm gonna take it."
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.680]   So he was teaching Frieda Fromreichmann hypnosis.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.960]   And he just kept doing it.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.400]   And after a while, he discovered that he was getting
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.200]   better results with a few sessions of hypnosis
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   than he was with daily psychoanalysis with his patients.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.540]   And so he switched his practice.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.200]   And so the dinner table conversations
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.360]   were pretty interesting.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.400]   And occasionally when he was making a movie of a patient,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.240]   I would get to watch that.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.920]   And so when I went to medical school,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.160]   I figured I'll take a course.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.360]   There was Tom Hackett, who was the chair of psychiatry
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.520]   at Mass General was teaching,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.760]   and it was a very interesting course.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.680]   And the day that converted me was I was doing my rotation
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.240]   at Children's Hospital in Boston.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.000]   And the nurse is telling me, "Spiegel, your next patient
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.880]   "is an asthmatic in room 437," or something.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.000]   And I'm just following the sound
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.680]   of the wheezes down the hall.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.520]   I go in the room.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.640]   This is 16-year-old girl, knuckles white,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.700]   bolt upright in bed, struggling for breath.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.080]   You can hear the wheezing.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.700]   She twice had subcutaneous epinephrine, didn't work.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.480]   They were thinking about general anesthesia
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   and starting her on steroids.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.220]   And her mother's there crying.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.060]   And I said, "I don't know what else to do."
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.200]   So I said, "You want to learn a breathing exercise?"
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.600]   And she nods.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.240]   And I got her hypnotized, and then I realized
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.000]   we hadn't gotten to asthma in the course yet.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.880]   So I made up something very complex.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.520]   I said, "Each breath you take will be a little deeper
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.080]   "and a little easier."
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.140]   And within five minutes, she's lying back in bed.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.080]   Her knuckles aren't white.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.920]   She's not wheezing.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.600]   Her mother stopped crying.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.440]   The nurse ran out of the room.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.540]   And the intern, my intern, comes to find me.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.140]   And I figure he's going to pat me on the back
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.920]   and say, "Nice job, Spiegel."
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.500]   He said, "The nurse has filed a complaint
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.820]   "with the nursing supervisor that you violated
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.280]   "a Massachusetts law by hypnotizing a minor
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.800]   "without parental consent."
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.320]   And I thought, "Oh, that's nice.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.660]   "I doubt there is a law like this."
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.480]   So the intern says, "You're going to have to stop
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.360]   "doing this with her."
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.200]   And I said, "Why?"
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.180]   He said, "It's dangerous."
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.440]   I said, "You're going to give her generalized anesthesia
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.820]   "and put her on steroids and talking to her is dangerous?"
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.000]   He said, "Well, you'll have to do it."
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.060]   And I said, "I'll tell you what.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.680]   "Take me off the case if you want,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.280]   "but I'm not going to tell a patient of mine
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.320]   "anything I know is not true."
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.620]   So there was a battle over the weekend
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.460]   about what to do.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.440]   And the intern, the chief resident attending,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.000]   we're all arguing about it.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.960]   And on Monday, they came back with a radical idea.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.300]   They said, "Let's ask the patient."
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.740]   I don't think this has ever been done
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.240]   at Children's Hospital before.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.020]   And she said, "Oh, I like this."
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.080]   She'd been hospitalized every month for three months
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.640]   in status asthmaticus.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.620]   She did have one subsequent hospitalization,
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.200]   but after that, went on to study
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   to be a respiratory therapist.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.520]   And I thought that anything that can help a patient
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.840]   that much violate a non-existent Massachusetts law,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.440]   frustrate the nursing supervisor,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.860]   had to be worth looking into.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.840]   So I just kept doing it.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.680]   I discovered that there were, you know,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.880]   all of my classmates in medical school
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.760]   had just read the new issue of the New England Journal
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.240]   and had some new medication to suggest.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.920]   And I would, you know, surgeons would say,
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.460]   "Look, if you can help this guy with his pain
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.880]   or his anxiety, anything above the neck,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.140]   that's yours, do it Spiegel."
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.700]   So, you know, I was having fun
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.540]   and being able to learn how to help people
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.940]   in a way that just otherwise was not being done.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.500]   And so it got me thinking about the fact that, you know,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.540]   we're born with this brain,
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.340]   but we don't have a user's manual for it.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.680]   And we don't use it nearly as well as we can.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.500]   And that's something your research is all about too.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.120]   And so I thought, "I want to understand this better
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.800]   and I want to see what we can do."
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.840]   Stage hypnotists drive me nuts, you know.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.860]   They make fools out of people.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.240]   There was one, this is a case my father was involved.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.060]   He got a call from, he was at Columbia.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.460]   He got a call, "Spiegel, you got to come see this woman.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.040]   She's in the ER and she's in some kind of weird upset state
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.600]   that happened."
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.400]   And it turned out she'd been on the show
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.960]   with a stage hypnotist who,
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.880]   and what they do, by the way, is they cycle around.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.620]   You know, they have, at the beginning of the show,
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.040]   they don't just grab somebody and say, "We're doing this."
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.420]   They get a bunch of people up.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.820]   They do what amounts to hypnotizability testing
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.960]   to see if people, and they get the ones
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560]   who are the most hypnotizable.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.400]   So she was the one.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.480]   And he said, "There's now a little bird in your hand
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.520]   and you're going to play with a bird."
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.600]   And she starts to cry and scream.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.640]   And he just gets her off the stage
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.220]   'cause it's very upsetting.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.920]   And she's wandering around New York City
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.600]   in the middle of the night, dissociated,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.220]   and brought to Columbia, and that's where my father saw her.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.840]   She was still in a kind of uncomfortable trance-like state.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.520]   And it turned out that she was the trophy wife
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.120]   of a very wealthy guy,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.920]   and she felt like a bird in a gilded cage.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.400]   And so to her, that image just triggered
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.500]   all of this sense of dissatisfaction,
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.740]   discomfort, fear about her life.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.780]   And he was able to get her reoriented
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.440]   and talk with her about what she was going to do
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.480]   with her life.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.340]   But I don't like stage hypnosis.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.000]   You're making fools out of people,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.580]   and you're using the fact,
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.360]   and that's what scares people about hypnosis.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.200]   They think you're losing control.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.160]   You're gaining control.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.000]   Self-hypnosis is a way of enhancing your control
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.120]   over your mind and your body.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.640]   It can work very well.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.280]   But because it gives you a kind of cognitive flexibility,
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.600]   you're able to shift sets very easily,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.280]   to give up judging and evaluating the way you usually do
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.760]   and see something from a different point of view.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   That's a great therapeutic opportunity,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.380]   but if misused, it could be a danger too.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.000]   And that's what scares people about it.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.820]   It is that very ability to suspend critical judgment
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.320]   and just have an experience and see what happens.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.860]   That can be a great therapeutic opportunity,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.280]   but if somebody is misusing it,
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.540]   it can be a way to harm people.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.040]   And there are plenty of examples
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.000]   of people having fantasies imposed on them
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.580]   that they come to think are realities.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.240]   It's not unusual these days.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   So it's an ability that if people learn to recognize
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.320]   and understand it, it can be a tremendous therapeutic tool.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   - I've been stage hypnotized
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.300]   and I've been clinically hypnotized many times
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.840]   through a self-hypnosis app we'll talk about later.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.640]   And then I know we have plans for you
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.040]   to hypnotize me today.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.920]   You've done it once before
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.480]   and I'm very hypnotizable as we both know.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.520]   - Right.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.200]   - We'll talk about how one can engage
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.800]   their hypnotizability.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.640]   - Sure.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.760]   - But the stage hypnosis was interesting.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.880]   This was in college, you know,
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.620]   they brought someone out to the dormitory
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   and I recall being one of the people that was selected
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:57.800]   and engaging in very bizarre behavior, right?
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.320]   It wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.900]   but it was pretty embarrassing.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.320]   And then being sent off the stage
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.960]   and as I was exiting, suddenly screaming something out
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.300]   because he had planted a suggestion of some sort.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.420]   And then I was told to look in my pocket
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.900]   and there was like a, I think a torn up dollar bill.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.840]   There were a bunch of things
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.920]   that I have vague recollection of,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.280]   but it raises a set of questions
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.300]   that really boiled down to, you know,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.060]   as a biologist, I always think that, you know,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.040]   there's no events in the brain, there are processes.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.160]   And so hypnosis, we know has an induction.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.200]   Then one is hypnotized, I imagine.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.700]   And then it sounds like this woman
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.920]   and this example of the bird and being in,
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.520]   being distraught in New York City
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.760]   is a failure to exit the hypnotic state.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.440]   Do we know what sorts of brain areas are active
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   during the induction, the let's call it the deep hypnosis,
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.720]   and then what's shutting off or changing
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.680]   as people exit hypnosis?
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.840]   - Yes, yes, we do.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.780]   We've studied that, we've been very interested in that.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.480]   And so we did a study where we selected highly
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.640]   and non-hypnotizable people so we could do the comparison
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.000]   and then hypnotize them in the functional MRI scanner.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.640]   And we found three things characterize the entry
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.200]   into the hypnotic state.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.120]   The first is turning down activity
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.200]   in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.840]   So the DACC is in the central front middle part
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   of the brain, as you well know.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.400]   And it's part of what we call the salience network.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.220]   It's a conflict detector.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.080]   So if you're engaged in work and you hear a loud noise
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.540]   that you think might be a gunshot,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.640]   that's your anterior cingulate cortex saying,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.020]   hey, wait a minute, there's a potential danger over there,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.260]   you better pay attention to it.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.280]   So it's a, it compares what you're doing
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.760]   with what else is going on and helps you decide what to do.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.640]   And as you can imagine, turning down activity in that region,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.600]   make it less likely that you'll be distracted
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.840]   and pulled out of whatever you're in.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.720]   And in another study, we found that highly hypnotizable
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.960]   people, even without being hypnotized,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.120]   have more functional connectivity between the DACC,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.480]   the anterior cingulate cortex,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.080]   and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.320]   So, which is part of the, a key region
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.840]   in the executive control network.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   So when you're engaging in tasks, you're enacting a plan,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.480]   you're writing a paper, you're doing whatever you're doing,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.920]   that's the prefrontal cortex is doing that.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.960]   And so if that is coordinated,
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.680]   we found more functional connectivity.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.080]   So when one is up, the other's up,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.520]   when one is down, the other's down.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.880]   That coordination implies that the brain is saying,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.240]   okay, go ahead, I know what you're doing,
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.760]   carry out that plan and don't worry
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.640]   about other possibilities.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.540]   So two other things happen when people are hypnotized.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.120]   One is that that DLPFC has higher functional connectivity
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.060]   with the insula, another part of the salience network.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.920]   It's a part of the mind-body control system,
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.840]   sensitive to what's happening in the body.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.160]   It's part of the pain network as well.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.880]   But it's also a region of the brain
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.080]   where you can control things in your body
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.280]   that you wouldn't think you could.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.680]   For example, we did a study years ago
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.840]   where we took people who were highly hypnotizable,
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.500]   hypnotized them, and told them to,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.080]   we went on an imaginary culinary tour.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.360]   So they would eat their favorite foods.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.900]   And we found that they increased
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.420]   their gastric acid secretion by 87%.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.520]   So their stomach was acting as though it was about to get.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.760]   I mean, there was one woman, it was so vivid for her
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.400]   that halfway through she said, let's stop, I'm full.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.920]   You know, eating these imaginary--
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.760]   - Having never eaten anything.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.600]   - Having never eaten anything.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   - Actual food. - No.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.440]   - Incredible.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.580]   - And then we got them to relax
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.760]   and think of anything but food or drink.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.280]   And we got like a 40% decrease in gastric acid secretion.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.220]   So they could, and that was DLPFC through the insula
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.800]   telling the stomach you're getting food
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.840]   or you're not getting food.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.480]   And even, we injected them with pentagastrin
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.000]   which triggers gastric acid release.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.880]   And even then in the hypnosis condition
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.780]   they had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.160]   So the brain has this amazing ability
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.620]   to control what's going on in the body
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.400]   in ways that we don't think we have ability to control.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.880]   That's just one example.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.480]   So that's the DLPFC insula connection.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.920]   The third thing that happens,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.000]   and this relates to what you did on the stage,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.560]   is you have inverse functional connectivity
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.000]   between the DLPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.440]   The posterior cingulate is part of the default mode network.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.320]   It's in the back of the brain.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.400]   And it's an area whose activity goes down,
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.440]   for example, in meditators.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.720]   And in meditation you're supposed to be selfless.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.320]   You're supposed to, the self is an illusion.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.440]   You're supposed to let it dissolve
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.880]   and just experience things.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.160]   And when you're doing that,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.200]   the posterior cingulate is decreasing in activity.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.420]   The inverse connection is I'm doing something
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.960]   but I'm not thinking about what it means for me.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.000]   I may not even remember much of it.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.460]   If I do, I don't care that much about it.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.680]   And so that is part of the dissociation
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.920]   that occurs with hypnosis.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.880]   So it's how you put things outside of conscious awareness
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.520]   and don't worry about what it means.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.360]   It also adds to cognitive flexibility.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.600]   If you're thinking,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.320]   well, people like me don't usually do this,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.240]   that may inhibit you from enacting
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   a new form of psychotherapy, for example,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.120]   that you've never done before.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.060]   But if you're having this decreased activity
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.160]   in the part of your brain that reflects on what it means,
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.440]   you're more likely to be cognitively flexible
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.640]   and willing to give it a try.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   And that's one of the therapeutic advantages
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.600]   of hypnosis as well.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.440]   - Fascinating.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.240]   And it's really,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.640]   I'm gonna put, I'm gonna embarrass you here a little bit.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.040]   But in the positive sense,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.800]   your laboratory is really the one that's pioneered
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.740]   brain imaging of hypnotic states.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.600]   And it sounds like it, that's my understanding.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.560]   Is that correct?
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.840]   - Yeah, I mean, there are other people
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.680]   who've done excellent research too,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.900]   but Pierre Rainville in Montreal and several other people,
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.680]   but we're one of the leading lamps
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.280]   in neuroimaging of hypnosis.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.160]   - I have to ask about attention deficit
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.640]   hyperactivity disorder.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.120]   I get a lot of questions about this.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   And I think a lot of people just struggle
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.000]   with holding attention nowadays
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.980]   because of interference with phones and devices.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.160]   And of course there is a lot of clinically legitimate
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.580]   ADHD out there, but the way that you describe
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.880]   the dorsal and the anterior cingulate
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.540]   and the salience network and this conflict detector of,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.520]   am I focusing on something or am I splitting my attention?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.440]   How distractible am I seems to relate to some extent
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.740]   to activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.820]   Do people with ADHD display disruptions
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.500]   in elements of these networks?
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   And has hypnosis ever been used to, or self-hypnosis,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.980]   I should be, to distinguish from stage hypnosis,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.960]   clinical and self-hypnosis has been used
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.740]   to enhance people's ability to focus and hold attention
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.780]   because that's such a built-in component
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.980]   of the hypnotic state.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.360]   - It's a great question.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.880]   There are, there's sort of two ways to think about it.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.440]   In terms of enhancing focus, yes, it has been very helpful
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.120]   in teaching people to just prepare your mind
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.200]   to narrow in and focus on something.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.540]   And when you're really engaged in reading something
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.400]   or you're writing a, I mean, I'll have that,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.200]   sometimes I'm thinking, oh God,
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.560]   I have to do this for another hour.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.880]   Other times, an hour will go by and I'll think,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.040]   hey, great, because when you're in the,
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.800]   it feels game-like to you, you're just assembling
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.680]   the parts of the puzzle and putting them together.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.280]   It's fun, you just get absorbed.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.480]   But for me, that's a hypnotic-like experience.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.780]   When I'm having trouble, when I'm struggling,
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.080]   sometimes doing things like self-hypnosis can help.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.680]   I'm not an expert on ADHD.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.640]   My impression is that you're right that these are people
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.720]   who are constantly distracted and rather rigid.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.800]   The other part of it is they're easily distractable.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.360]   They're very upset when they get distracted.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.560]   And they're rather rigid in what they want to attend to
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.960]   and what they can't, I think as a way
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.740]   of controlling this distractability, frankly.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.420]   My guess is that many people with ADHD
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.480]   would not be that hypnotizable, but I haven't studied it.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   So it's possible that for some people with that disorder,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.880]   training in self-hypnosis might help,
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.160]   but we'd have to see how hypnotizable they were
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.120]   and take it from there.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   - I want to return to some of the underlying neural networks
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.200]   and the clinical applications.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   But what sorts of things, aside from the asthma,
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.320]   have you used hypnosis successfully for?
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.180]   Or have others used clinical hypnosis for?
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.180]   And are there any particular areas of psychiatric challenges
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.000]   or illnesses, I guess they're called,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   that are particularly amenable to hypnotic treatment?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.360]   - Yes, there are.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   Hypnosis is very good as a problem-focused treatment.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.360]   It's really, it's the oldest Western conception
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.060]   of a psychotherapy, and it can be used for specific problems
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.860]   in a way that's very helpful.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.420]   We found it very helpful for stress reduction,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.500]   for helping people deal,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.200]   we're all dealing with stress these days.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.600]   And it's helpful, that mind-body connection is very helpful
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.540]   because part of the problem with stress is your perception,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.520]   you mentioned it earlier in a sort of good sense,
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.400]   you're at a football game or something
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.020]   and you feel the physical reaction.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.960]   That can be a reinforcing thing.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.820]   Wow, this is exciting, let's do it.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.540]   It can also be very distracting.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.400]   So you're worried about getting COVID
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.160]   or you're worried about some other physical problem you have
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.500]   and you notice it in your body, your body tenses up,
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.600]   you start to sweat, the sympathetic nervous system goes,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.140]   your heart rate goes up.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.020]   And when you notice that, you think,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.060]   oh God, this is really bad.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.140]   And then you feel worse.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.760]   So it's like a snowball rolling downhill.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.840]   And then you feel worse and then your body gets worse.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.500]   Hypnosis can be very helpful
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.980]   in dissociating somatic reaction
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.320]   from psychological reactions.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.800]   So we teach people to imagine their body floating somewhere
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.320]   safe and comfortable, like a bath, a lake, a hot tub
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.400]   or floating in space, and then picture the problem
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.320]   that they're stressing them on an imaginary screen
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.220]   with a rule that no matter what you see on the screen,
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.800]   you keep your body comfortable.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.860]   So at this point, you still can't control the stress,
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.660]   but you can control your physical reaction to it.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.060]   And that starts you feeling more in control.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.620]   At least there's one thing I can manage.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.380]   And then you can use it to think through
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.780]   or visualize through one thing you might do
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.740]   about that stressor.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.340]   So hypnosis is very helpful in controlling mind body
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.480]   interaction in relation to stress.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.560]   It's very helpful for people to get to sleep.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.820]   We're having a lot of fun with that.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.220]   I'm getting emails from people who said,
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.020]   I haven't slept right in 15 years
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.700]   and now for the first time, I'm listening to your app
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.540]   and I can sleep at night.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.680]   So it's very helpful.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.840]   And again, if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.060]   I tell people don't look at the clock,
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:13.060]   that's an arousal cue, you just wake up more.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.180]   But picture whatever you're thinking about
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.120]   or worrying about on that imaginary screen
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.060]   while your body's floating.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.980]   So watch your own movie, but keep your body floating.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.660]   And many people can use that to get back to sleep.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.660]   - I've been using the self-hypnosis for sleep
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.400]   for a long time.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.540]   And now the Reverie app, and we'll talk about
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.620]   our relationship to the Reverie app and its uses.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.620]   I find it incredibly useful for falling back asleep
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.600]   in the middle of the night.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.340]   And it raises a question I've found,
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.060]   and I think I understand this correctly,
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.940]   that one can do self-hypnosis during the daytime.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.180]   And then if there's an issue that comes up later,
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.460]   like, so for instance, do self-hypnosis for stress reduction
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.120]   away from the stressful event to prepare one
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.460]   to deal with stress better,
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.860]   or do a hypnosis for improving the return to sleep.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.260]   And that can be done when you actually want to go to sleep,
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.900]   but it's kind of a training up of these networks, right?
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.740]   - That's right.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.220]   - So is there evidence that these brain networks
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.400]   actually form stronger connections
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.760]   when people do self-hypnosis over time?
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.340]   - Well, there's a rule in neurobiology, as you know,
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.500]   that neurons that fire together, wire together.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.580]   - Our friend, Carla Schatz, not Donald Hebb, by the way.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.520]   I keep trying to, there's a widespread myth in the world
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.900]   that is unfortunately all over the internet,
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.860]   which is that the fire together, wire together
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.060]   was said by the psychologist, Donald Hebb.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.940]   Donald had many important things,
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.300]   but it is the neurobiologist, Carla Schatz.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.380]   - That's exactly right.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.100]   - Yes, is at Stanford, but was also at Berkeley and Harvard.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.860]   So also decent schools.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.260]   But is at Stanford who said fire together, wire together.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.500]   And so she deserves the credit for that statement.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.160]   Yeah, so with repeated use of self-hypnosis,
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.200]   one could imagine that these networks are getting stronger.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.700]   - I would think so.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.060]   We don't have evidence of that yet,
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.580]   but long-term potentiation provides a pathway,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.860]   and you've described them on your program a number of times,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.060]   that allow for repeated activation of a network
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.260]   to actually build new connections that work.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.480]   And at the least, even from a learning
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.740]   and memory point of view,
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.660]   memory is all a network of associations.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.740]   That's how we remember things.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.580]   And the example I like to give is you go back
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.500]   to your grade school, and you see these little tiny lockers,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.660]   and the size is all wrong, and you suddenly have a flood
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.520]   of memories that were obviously stored there,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.540]   but you just didn't think of.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.360]   So context and association is what memory is about.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.340]   If you start to acquire memories about a problem,
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.340]   so one thing we use hypnosis for
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.020]   is treating phobias, for example.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.100]   And the problem with people who have phobias,
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.660]   like airplane phobias, or crossing a bridge,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.260]   or being up high, is that the more they avoid it,
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.600]   the more the only source of associations
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.940]   and memories is their fear.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.840]   They don't have any good experiences with it
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.260]   'cause they avoid it.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.380]   It's like get back on the horse
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.220]   after you fall off kind of thing.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   And with hypnosis, if you can start people able
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.360]   to manage their anxiety enough
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.760]   that they can have more, a wider array of experiences,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.380]   they start to have a network of associations
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.820]   that isn't so negative and may even be positive.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.860]   - So it's almost like a, sorry to interrupt,
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.900]   but I have to ask, it's almost like a exposure therapy
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.020]   done in the mind.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:43.860]   - Yes. - I mean,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.680]   it's always in the mind.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.860]   I mean, even exposure to, if I have a snake phobia,
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   which I don't, I don't like snakes,
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.220]   but I don't think it qualifies as a full-blown phobia.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.940]   I think I have a healthy fear of snakes.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.740]   But if, let's say I had a snake phobia,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.740]   the typical approach would be,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.220]   cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.920]   would be to show a picture of a snake,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.380]   or then a rubber snake, then a real snake,
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.260]   and eventually the person is holding a boa constrictor
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.080]   or something like that.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.640]   That's all in the mind because it's all translated
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.820]   into nervous system signals.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.400]   But with hypnosis, it sounds like you can give
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.380]   a number of positive experiences
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.580]   without having to use any props,
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.380]   without having to bring any animals into the room,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.040]   drive someone across the bridge, is that right?
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.260]   - Yes, I had a woman who was a very successful
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.020]   businesswoman, high level in a corporation.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.660]   I had a terrible dog phobia.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.320]   And so I had her imagine that somebody brought in
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.420]   a dog to the room and I said, "What are you doing?"
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.420]   And you could see her getting tense.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.460]   And she said, "I'm waiting to see what the dog does."
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.660]   And I said, "If somebody who works for you
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.560]   comes into your office, would you freeze
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.580]   and wait to see what they did?"
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.820]   And she said, "Of course not."
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.240]   And I tell them what to do, you know.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.700]   And I said, "Well, so you're immobilizing yourself.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.100]   The power isn't with the dog, it's with you.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.840]   So imagine what you might do to engage the dog
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.500]   and help control the situation."
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.500]   And she said, "Thanks."
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.460]   And this reminds me of one of my favorite stories
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.120]   about hypnosis, that my father was seeing a woman
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.360]   who lived in midtown Manhattan
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.860]   and had a horrible dog phobia.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.360]   You know, she'd drop things, she'd spill coffee.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.560]   You know, she saw a dog.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.640]   She would time her trips to the store
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.080]   when she thought it was least likely
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.320]   that people would be walking dogs.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.400]   - Now that wouldn't be possible.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.560]   Everyone, it's like a fleet of French bulldogs
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.920]   taking over New York City.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.160]   - So he taught her to think of dog as a friend,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.980]   have a neighbor who had a dog, bring the dog over,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.540]   but hold the dog by the collar and make sure.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.320]   And gradually she was able to stroke the dog
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.160]   and say, "Dog friend,"
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.240]   and, "Distinguish between wild and tame animals.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.400]   There are animals you should be afraid of."
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.640]   So she seemed to be doing better.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.180]   He called back about three months later
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.620]   and asked for her and said,
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.480]   "Well, who's calling?"
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.880]   The son said, and he said, "Dr. Spiegel."
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.140]   And the boy said, "That's weird."
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.520]   And my father said, "What's weird?"
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.440]   He said, "Spiegel's in heat."
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.620]   She had bought a dog and named it Spiegel.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.860]   Talk about transference.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.280]   - I love it.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.600]   - But it really speaks to the power of this.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.720]   And it brings me back to this issue.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.340]   So what is different about what your father did
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.680]   in that case with this woman
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.200]   in terms of what happened in hypnosis
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.560]   that allowed her to go from being completely terrified
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.820]   of dogs to owning a dog and naming it after your father,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.920]   which I find amusing.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.700]   But that's different than just the two of them
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.620]   sitting down and talking about it, right?
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.500]   In therapy, the narrative is a huge component
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.240]   and in hypnosis, narrative is a huge component.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.380]   So it must be that the brain state
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.620]   is what is really different
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.380]   because we'll talk about trauma in a few minutes,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.680]   but I think people who have trauma or phobias
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.160]   certainly could have a conversation about it.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.380]   Some of them might freeze up.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.980]   Some of them might lose their articulation and so forth.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.180]   But what is different about that state
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.260]   that combines with narrative,
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.180]   you think to allow these underlying neural networks
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.140]   to engage her to change?
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.620]   'Cause I find this so fascinating
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.620]   because every attempt at dealing with stress or phobia
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.980]   in the clinical setting
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.380]   involves some discussion about what it is.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   But here we're not talking about
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.840]   any medication being introduced,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.180]   at least not in these particular circumstances.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.900]   So I just, I realized it's kind of an obvious question.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.620]   Like it has to be some difference in brain activity,
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.420]   but I find that to be incredible.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.140]   The control variable there is the brain state.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.500]   It's not what's spoken.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.480]   - You're raising a couple of very important issues, Andrew.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.140]   We talked earlier about systematic desensitization
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.700]   where you sort of lay out a hierarchy of things
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.220]   and do it one at a time.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.400]   I think of this as unsystematic desensitization
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.360]   because you're changing mental states.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.380]   And I think there's more and more evidence
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.340]   that mental state change itself has therapeutic potential.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.960]   We're seeing that with ketamine,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.440]   treating depression as a sociogenic drug.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.680]   We see it, we know it every morning
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.360]   when we wake up, that problem.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.320]   You made the mistake of reading a nasty email at 11 p.m.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.400]   You didn't know what to do.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.200]   You wake up in the morning, you think, oh, that idiot.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.740]   Yeah, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.580]   So just changing mental state itself
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.000]   has therapeutic potential.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.860]   And I think we underestimate our ability
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.340]   to regulate and change responses,
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.340]   to be cognitively, emotionally, and somatically flexible.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.500]   And so we do things, you're right,
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.420]   that follow similar principles of facing a problem,
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.420]   seeing it from a different point of view.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.940]   And you've done a really nice podcast on trauma and stress
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.900]   and how you have to expose yourself to it,
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.340]   not avoid it, as we talked about before,
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.240]   and then find some way to reconnect to it,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.640]   to substitute something that can make you feel good
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.520]   rather than bad so that you activate other centers
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.120]   of the brain, like mesolimbic reward system.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.520]   And so I do that with hypnosis,
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.960]   and you can do it much faster.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.900]   People don't think they can, but they can.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.660]   If you're having, right now, that physical experience,
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.520]   I'm thinking about this,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.960]   but I'm not feeling as bad as I used to,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.520]   that can be a powerful thing,
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.040]   and you can do it with hypnosis.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.860]   So I had a woman came to see me
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.860]   who had suffered an attempted rape.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.460]   It was getting dark.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.200]   She was coming back from the grocery store,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.820]   and this guy grabs her and wants to get her up
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.660]   into her apartment.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.700]   It's outside her apartment.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.080]   And she starts fighting with him,
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   and she winds up with a basilar skull fracture.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.300]   He runs away.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.600]   The cops come.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.140]   Since she hadn't been raped, they left.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:54.980]   They weren't interested.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.920]   And she wanted to use hypnosis to get a better image
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.400]   of what this guy looked like,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.160]   which is a painful, upsetting thing.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.460]   So she was quite hypnotizable.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.680]   I got her floating.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.040]   I say, "You're safe and comfortable now.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.340]   "Nothing can happen that will harm your body,
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.260]   "but on the left side of the screen,
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.360]   "I want you to picture this guy
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.600]   "and his approaching and what's happening."
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.360]   And she said, "I really, the light, it was getting dark.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.140]   "I really can't see much of his facial features,
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.680]   "but I do recognize something
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.900]   "I hadn't allowed myself to remember.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.520]   "If he gets me upstairs, he doesn't just want to rape me.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.160]   "He's gonna kill me."
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.080]   And so, in some ways, what she was seeing
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.920]   was even worse.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.160]   So you're thinking, good Spiegel,
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.000]   you made her even more frightened than she was before.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.600]   But as you had pointed out in your PTSD stress lecture,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.240]   you've got to confront the trauma
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.460]   to restructure your understanding of it.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.380]   So on the other side of the screen, I had her picture.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:53.040]   What are you doing to protect yourself?
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.860]   And everybody in a trauma situation
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.560]   engages in some strategy of self-protection.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.520]   That's the Salience Network kicking in.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.520]   And she said, "You know what?
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.940]   "He's surprised and I'm fighting that hard.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.760]   "He didn't think I would."
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.680]   And so she realized, on the one hand,
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.580]   that it was even worse than she thought it was,
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.480]   but on the other hand,
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.800]   that she actually probably saved her life.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.520]   And so it was a way of helping her restructure
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.680]   her experience of the trauma and make it more tolerable.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.280]   So that helped with her.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.240]   She didn't, she couldn't identify the guy,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.120]   but it helped her restructure and understand her experience.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   And that's something that you can do
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.880]   in just talking straight out psychotherapy,
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.640]   but sometimes you can do a hell of a lot faster
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.200]   and more efficiently using hypnosis.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.680]   And there is one randomized trial out of Israel
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.160]   that shows that adding hypnosis to PTSD treatment
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.160]   actually improves outcome.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.160]   So it's a way of accomplishing things that we understand
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   in the broader psychotherapy world,
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.400]   but much more quickly and sometimes effectively.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.560]   - Yeah, it sounds like going into,
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.160]   somewhat into the state that one is trying to deal with,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.600]   but then dissociating from that state is key.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.480]   And I could imagine, and I've been open about this
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.380]   on various podcasts.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.200]   I've done a lot of analysis over the years.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.440]   So in, but I've experienced myself that in those sessions,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.160]   depending on how I show up to them,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.320]   I might just get in kind of a laundry list of what happened
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.120]   as opposed to actually feeling anything
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.160]   around what happened.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.640]   And I think people probably vary
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.760]   in the extent to which they can drop into feeling states
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.240]   and it can depend on the day.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.080]   It can be dependent on how well you slept the night before
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.360]   and so on.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.840]   - There's one thing I might add, Andrew,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.640]   and that is, you know, there's a notion
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   of the late Gordon Bauer.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.240]   He did, we just had a memorial for Gordon at Stanford.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.120]   He died about a year ago.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.960]   Brilliant cognitive psychologist,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.480]   sort of one of the founders of cognitive psychology
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.280]   at Stanford and a great pitcher.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.400]   He almost became a major league pitcher,
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.420]   but he decided to go to grad school instead.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.720]   And I'm glad he did.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.080]   But Gordon helped establish the concept
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.440]   of state-dependent memory,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.140]   that when you're in a certain mental state,
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.200]   you enhance your ability to remember things about it.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.120]   And the sort of the bad example of that
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.800]   is the drunk who hides the bottle
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.160]   and can't remember where he put it
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.240]   until he gets drunk again,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.220]   that he's in that same mental state.
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.480]   People go into dissociative states when they're traumatized.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.080]   So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.360]   and deal with the memories better
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.400]   because they're more in the mental state
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.560]   that is more like what happened.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.800]   And most rape victims will tell you,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.160]   "I was floating above my body feeling sorry
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.500]   "for the woman being assaulted below."
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.140]   People in traumatic episodes, they just say,
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.040]   "You know, I blank out.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.880]   "I don't know what's happening.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.940]   "I'm on autopilot."
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.320]   And that's a kind of self-hypnotic state.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.520]   So when you use hypnosis to help them deal
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.960]   with the traumatic memory,
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.500]   you're making the state they're in
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.600]   right there in your office with you
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.040]   more congruent to the state they were likely in
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.200]   when the trauma happened.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.840]   And I think that is part of what helps facilitate
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.600]   treatment of trauma-related disorders.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.840]   - I see.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   So that makes me have to ask every question I have to ask
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.860]   'cause I really feel it as almost a compulsion.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.680]   Then if dissociation during a traumatic episode
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.060]   is part of the adaptive strategy,
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.440]   but it creates certain issues.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.940]   It creates problems, right?
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.240]   Why would something like ketamine,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.800]   which creates a dissociative state,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.300]   be useful for the treatment of trauma?
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.560]   This is what I'm confused about these days
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.680]   because our colleague, Carl Deisseroth,
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.040]   who's also been on this podcast
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.460]   and his coworkers have figured out,
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.760]   okay, there's these layer one networks in the neocortex
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.360]   and those are involved in dissociative state.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.680]   And so we're starting to gain some understanding
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.400]   of how ketamine works at a neural level.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.760]   It does seem as if for certain populations
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.840]   it can be a useful treatment.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.880]   I don't know, I've never tried it.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.420]   I don't know what the current status of that is,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.740]   but it is legal.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.280]   It is allowed, at least it's FDA approved, and it's in use.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.840]   Why would dissociative states be useful
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.880]   if some element of dissociation is what gave rise
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.600]   to the trauma memory in the first place?
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.660]   - Well, yeah, Carl had a brilliant paper in Nature
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.200]   where it was from rats to humans in one paper.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.840]   And he showed that there's this rhythmic discharge
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.280]   in the retrosplenial region that is associated,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.040]   that is triggered by ketamine.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.960]   And the rats actually showed dissociative-like behavior
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.100]   in that they would touch a hot pad
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.280]   that they ordinarily wouldn't
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.320]   and they didn't seem to have much pain in their paw.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.520]   And he then had a male subject
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.120]   who had implanted electrodes.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.860]   - Human. - A human subject, yeah.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.700]   Human subject.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:50.700]   And the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic activity,
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.860]   and when they did,
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.100]   he would report being in a dissociative state.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.660]   And his description was,
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.740]   "It's like being a pilot of an airplane."
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.560]   And then I felt myself walking out of the cockpit
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.820]   and the plane was still flying.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.220]   - That sounds terrifying to me.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.060]   (laughing)
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.140]   That sounds terrifying.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.620]   I want to be in my body most of the time, you know.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.460]   - That's right.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.040]   But the point is, in a way, the principle, Andrew,
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.500]   is like the principle you said,
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.900]   that you need to re-confront a traumatic situation
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.280]   before you can modulate your associations to it.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.340]   So you have to accept it,
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.860]   accept the arousal, put some boundaries around it,
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.300]   and then figure out how you can approach that problem
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.820]   or how you did approach that problem
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.300]   from a different point of view.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.980]   So it does not surprise,
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.020]   in fact, we've studied people who dissociated
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.100]   during the Loma Prieta earthquake
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.380]   and the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.580]   - I remember both of those well.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.240]   - Earthquakes follow me.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.000]   - So there's the south and then the northridge.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.840]   - I'm going to keep--
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.120]   - So there'll be one layer of this after me.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.420]   (laughing)
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.380]   - I'm starting to dissociate, Andrew.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.320]   So dissociation does compartmentalize experience,
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.100]   but that means from the point of view of treating trauma,
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.380]   it's an inhibition.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.500]   You don't engage it.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.980]   It's like it happened over there.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.740]   And I think what happens is that people
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.740]   are sometimes too good at being able to separate themselves
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.540]   from the recollection, so it's in there somewhere.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.320]   It's out of sight, but it's not out of mind.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.660]   It's having effects on you, but you can't deal with it.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.300]   You can't reprocess it.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.820]   So I do think one reason ketamine might work
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.520]   is that, in fact, it allows you to keep,
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.040]   to re-approach the dissociative experience
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.000]   in a way that you can then start to think about
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.080]   and do something about it.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.360]   And just the fact you can turn it on and off,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.540]   and that's also where self-hypnosis is so helpful.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.360]   It's not something that just comes over you
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.580]   and happens to you, it's something you can make happen.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.860]   You can control it, you can do something with it.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.520]   So you feel less helpless and out of control.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.420]   The essence of trauma is helplessness.
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.980]   It's not fear, it's not pain, it's helplessness.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.620]   You become an object.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.180]   You become just your body.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.500]   You don't control what's going on,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.240]   and we're not used to that.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.380]   You and I have discussed this brilliant paper
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.500]   on anticipation of breathing,
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.340]   and it's not whether you breathe,
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.820]   inhale, or exhale, or hold your breath.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.280]   It's that if you think you can inhale and you can't,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.680]   that is really upsetting, understandably.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.060]   And so the issue is control.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.120]   And hypnosis, which has this terrible reputation
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.880]   of taking away control, is actually a superb way
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.500]   of enhancing your control over mind and body.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.600]   - I love that.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.120]   And it reminds me that naming is so important.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.640]   You almost wonder if self-hypnosis and clinical hypnosis
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.600]   had been called something else,
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.220]   that it would have been separated out from stage hypnosis
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:43.220]   in a way that would make it less scary, weird,
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.680]   complicated for people to embrace.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.420]   But part of the reason for having this discussion
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.380]   is I've had great experiences with hypnosis.
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.180]   I've seen the data.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.700]   We're talking about a lot of clinical examples.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.240]   It's incredibly powerful,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.340]   and it boils right down to neural brain states.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.760]   And I think in the years to come,
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.720]   it's going to become more widespread.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.280]   Along those lines, how quickly,
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.440]   you've described some examples of people
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.720]   getting relief very quickly.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.500]   How permanent are those changes?
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.160]   Is there a need for follow-up?
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.520]   And related to that,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.140]   I'm sure a number of people are listening to this
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.200]   and thinking, "Wonderful, I'd love to get hypnotized
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.640]   for any number of different things by Dr. Spiegel
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.320]   or somebody else expert in clinical hypnosis."
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.120]   But they might not have access to you
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.400]   or somebody with similar training.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.200]   So what is the power?
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.900]   So how quickly does it work?
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.960]   How long lasting are those changes?
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.940]   And then is it necessary to work with a clinical hypnotist?
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.720]   And is it better to do that than self-hypnosis
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.660]   and so on and so forth?
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.560]   Maybe you could just give us a contour of the landscape
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.200]   of directed and self-directed treatment.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.000]   - Well, typically most people start
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.200]   by coming to see a clinician like me.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.540]   It's better to see someone who has licensing and training
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.640]   in their professional discipline,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.800]   medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.200]   - 'Cause there are a lot of hypnotists out there
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.240]   who are just hypnotists.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.080]   - Just hypnotists.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.920]   - Oh, okay.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.880]   - And the key issue is somebody who can really assess
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.380]   what your problem is and make sure
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.680]   that you're not talking someone
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.920]   into reducing their chest pain
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.200]   rather than getting their coronary artery problem.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.560]   - 'Cause they could have a real issue there.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.400]   - They could, right.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.400]   Hypnosis might adjust, but wouldn't deal
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.160]   with the deeper underlying issue.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.000]   - That's right.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.080]   On the other hand, and typically when I use it with people,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.720]   I often only see them once or twice or periodically,
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.300]   but not every week, and certainly not every day
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.380]   if they have a pain problem.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.840]   And hypnosis is very helpful for pain.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:51.080]   And so what I'm doing is identifying
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.280]   how hypnotizable they are.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.940]   I give them a standard brief test
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.880]   of their ability to experience hypnosis.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.440]   And then going through a self-hypnosis exercise with them
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.200]   to deal with the problem, seeing how they respond to it,
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.940]   and then teaching them how to do it for themselves.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.880]   And in the old days, I used to have them use their iPhone
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.040]   and record that part of the session
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.020]   so they could play back the hypnosis experience.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.100]   Now we've developed an app, Reverie,
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:22.740]   that can teach people and step them through
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.440]   dealing with pain, stress, focus, insomnia,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.520]   and help people eat better and stop smoking.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.240]   And we have elements that take about 15 minutes
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.120]   and elements that just take one or two minutes
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.220]   that people can refresh and reinforce.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.420]   - Two-minute hypnosis.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.500]   - Yes, yes.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.620]   And it's one to two minutes now.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   And we're finding that two-thirds of the people
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.680]   find that even just the one-minute refresher
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.820]   helps them feel better.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.080]   They're reporting they feel better.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.920]   So the nice thing is you know right away
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.760]   whether it's likely to help you or not.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.480]   And we've found, we've done studies looking at hypnosis
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.320]   for pain relief in acute medical procedures.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.540]   We did a randomized trial that we published in The Lancet.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.960]   Three conditions, people getting arterial cut-downs
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.380]   to chemoembolized tumors in the liver
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.700]   or visualized renal artery stenosis.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.300]   You don't use general anesthesia for this.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.360]   It's very uncomfortable and people are anxious.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.660]   And we had three conditions.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.300]   One was standard care, they could push a button
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.920]   and get opioids, IV.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.900]   - Is during the surgery.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.740]   - During the surgery.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.200]   The second is they could do that
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.640]   plus they had a friendly nurse comforting them.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.460]   So we controlled for pleasant attention and support.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.720]   And the third was we taught them self-hypnosis
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.560]   for pain control.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.460]   So you're feeling, you can change the temperature.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.580]   Your body is cool, tingling and numb.
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.540]   You're floating in ice water and feeling comfortable.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.900]   Or go somewhere else, leave your body here
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.740]   and go to a desert island and enjoy yourself.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.860]   And we found that it's about two and a half hour procedure
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.380]   that by an hour and a half,
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.920]   the hypnosis group had reduced their pain by 80%
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.740]   compared to the standard care group
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.100]   using half the amount of opioids.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.020]   They had fewer complications
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.340]   and the procedure took 17 minutes less time on average
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.620]   to get done because not only was the patient more relaxed,
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.860]   so was the treatment staff.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.380]   They weren't dealing with someone who's struggling
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.540]   and uncomfortable.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.220]   We measured their anxiety.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.740]   And same thing, the hypnosis group,
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.940]   I was worried they were all dead.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.980]   They had no anxiety after an hour and a half.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.660]   They were saying I'm fine, you know.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.980]   And they were fine.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.100]   And the standard care group had five out of 10
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.860]   anxiety scores at that point.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.280]   So we published that in The Lancet.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.460]   Big randomized trial.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.860]   If we had a drug that did that,
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.300]   every hospital in the country would be using it now.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.300]   But there's no industry to push it.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.880]   So that's part of what helped us decide
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.720]   that we needed to help people do this with Reverie
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.060]   and teach them how to do it
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.820]   and provide interactive support for them to do it.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.980]   And the question, although, is does it work long term?
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.080]   'Cause what we can do acutely doesn't necessarily carry on.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.700]   So we did a randomized trial of women
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.000]   with metastatic breast cancer.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.940]   They had advancing disease.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.000]   We met with them in a support group once a week
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.660]   and taught them self-hypnosis for stress and anxiety
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.100]   and pain control at the end.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.400]   And by the end of a year, the treatment group
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.120]   had half the pain the control group did
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.580]   on the same and very low amounts of medication.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.500]   So it lasts.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.820]   And they would say when I felt that pain in my chest
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.980]   and thought it was a metastasis, I just did the exercise.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:35.640]   I got myself in a warm bath and I felt fine.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   So it works because it becomes a skill that people acquire.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.040]   But they can tell right away
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.660]   whether it's likely to help them working with a clinician
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.920]   or now using the app or other ways of helping them learn
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.100]   to use it as a skill.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.960]   So the nice thing is you will know very quickly
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.420]   whether it's likely to help you or not.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.100]   And if it is, you can learn to do it for yourself.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:57.940]   - That's great.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.180]   And we will, again, there'll be a link
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.740]   to Reverie in the caption.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.100]   It's available for Apple and Android.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.400]   And I think even though there's a nominal cost there,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.340]   I think that, as you mentioned, medications
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.900]   and other approaches to dealing with these problems
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.960]   are quite expensive and have all the potential
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.220]   for side effects and things.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.120]   Not that some of those aren't also useful.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.320]   - Could I, before you get to that, just one thing.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.080]   We've worked very hard on the app.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.620]   We have an iOS app for Apple.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:33.500]   We decided to table for a moment redoing the Android app.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.880]   So it's not, it was available when we were working
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.680]   through the Alexa platform.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.800]   It's not at the moment, but it will be soon.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.020]   So I just don't want people to be disappointed
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.640]   if they're looking for it for Android.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.720]   It's on our agenda, but we don't have it at the moment.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.300]   - Great, thanks for that clarification.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.440]   So hopefully in time for both.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.680]   I get asked a lot about obsessive thoughts
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.720]   or intrusive thoughts.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.300]   I also get asked a lot about OCD.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.320]   Is there any evidence that hypnosis or self-hypnosis
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.080]   can be used for dealing with obsessive thoughts?
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.480]   - Sometimes.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.200]   There are some very obsessional people who just turn out
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.320]   not to be that hypnotizable and it's not random.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.440]   They tend to be so over controlling of thought.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.000]   They're all busy evaluating rather than experiencing.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.040]   So in some ways-- - I know a few people
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   like that. (laughing)
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.920]   Sounds like, it sounds like an adaptive mindset
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:33.500]   for a lot of professions and that we get trained up in that
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.620]   during school, how to obsess over the exam,
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:40.280]   obsess over our social interactions.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.560]   I mean, it's part of becoming a functional human being
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.260]   and yet you can take us down a different--
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.420]   - We sometimes overdo it.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.100]   I mean, I'll tell you one example from extreme situations.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.820]   'Cause you're judging, evaluating,
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.180]   you're not letting yourself experience,
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.700]   including emotionally.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.140]   I know somebody who listens to the tapes
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.760]   from airplanes that go down.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.360]   So they get the black box and they listen to it.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.760]   And he said to me, you know--
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.260]   - That's his profession or he does this recreationally?
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.980]   - No, it's his profession, that's what he did.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.220]   And 'cause they're trying to do accident prevention
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.400]   and how to handle things.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   And he said that you worry about people panicking, right?
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.740]   And here these guys know that they've got 30 seconds
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.260]   or some 45 seconds and they're just going
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.500]   through their checklist.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.980]   He said they don't panic enough.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.840]   They're taught that this is what you do
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.360]   and there is reason, there's good reason for it.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.580]   But sometimes they overdo it.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:36.340]   And it's painful to listen to this
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.500]   'cause you know what's gonna happen.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.260]   So it's kind of a balance we have to hit.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.540]   And sometimes we get too emotional and too absorbed
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:46.140]   and you're not with it enough
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:48.260]   to sort of see other possibilities.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.100]   That can be a problem.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.380]   But on the other hand, sometimes you're too rigid
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.460]   and controlled and you don't let your emotions guide you
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.820]   to what you need to do to protect yourself
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:57.660]   or protect others.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.860]   So I would say in general that people with OCD
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.840]   are on the less hypnotizable side of the spectrum.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.460]   They're less likely to allow themselves to engage in any.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.260]   And the typical example is the checking with OCD,
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.180]   for example.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:17.020]   They don't remember whether they locked the door
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.380]   or turned off the gas in the oven
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.100]   and they keep going back and they keep checking.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.560]   So there the evaluative component of the brain
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.140]   kind of overrides the experiential one.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.340]   And sometimes people can get some benefit
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.440]   but they're not a group that I would select
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.120]   for being the most likely to respond
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.140]   to self-hypnotic approaches.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.080]   - Are superstitions similar?
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:44.240]   - Superstitions, I think that's more.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.740]   There are people who are very hypnotizable
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.060]   who keep getting caught up in things like superstitions.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:55.220]   And there the imagination supplants the reality.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.120]   And we've seen a lot of that happening recently.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.200]   And so I think there it's possible
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.260]   that they could be helped by learning to sort of see it
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.040]   but put it in context, see it from a different point of view.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.080]   - I developed a pretty vicious superstition
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.920]   when I was in college and it was hard to break, actually.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   I always feel that when I talk to clinicians
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.880]   I have to reveal certain things about my own pathology.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.200]   - You'll get my bill later. - Thank you, yes.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.440]   It's part of the reason I arranged this, I'm just kidding.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.280]   But yeah, I did.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.160]   I had a habit of knocking on wood for things
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.720]   and I noticed it started to,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.480]   I would sneak knocking on wood every once in a while
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.360]   'cause I didn't want people to think I was doing too often.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.200]   And then I started to realize
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.400]   that it was becoming a little bit of a reflex.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.800]   And then I saw this incredible video
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.840]   from Ben Solevsky's lab at Harvard.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.320]   He studies motor patterns.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.760]   He has these rats that press different sequences
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.400]   of levers and turn dials in order to get a pellet of food.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.440]   But that as they do that,
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.960]   they'll start to introduce these behaviors
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.720]   that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.180]   Like they'll start scratching their hindquarters
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.600]   and things like that and their head,
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.720]   excuse me, they don't wear hats, and flipping their ears.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.320]   And this is just like a pitcher before throwing a baseball.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.160]   That we do this, we start to incorporate motor behaviors
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.200]   that are unrelated to the outcome,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.720]   but our mind somehow starts to think
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.620]   that they're necessary for the outcome.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.680]   And so then you incorporate it.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.040]   So I decided to break it by simply forcing myself
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.880]   to not do it for about a week.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.800]   And then it just seemed like a ridiculous thing to do.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.880]   Knock on wood.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.460]   - We call that response prevention and it works.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.800]   'Cause what you do is you set up a new context in your brain
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.600]   where you get the outcome you want
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.080]   devoid of the extraneous behavior.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.840]   - And I knew it was nuts, right?
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.320]   I knew it was illogical,
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.620]   but somehow these things take on meaning.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.440]   So we talked about stress reduction,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.220]   the utility of hypnosis for stress reduction,
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.880]   phobias, pain, possibly, we don't know,
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.580]   but for things like ADHD and OCD,
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.980]   it just will depend on hypnotizability.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.640]   You talked about this beautiful study
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   on the metastatic breast cancer outcome or patients.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.040]   Hypnotizability is clearly a key variable.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.720]   So could you please tell us what hypnotizability is,
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.040]   how it's evaluated, and what the Spiegel eye roll test is?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.880]   - Okay, sure.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   So hypnotizability is just a capacity
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.240]   to have hypnotic experiences.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.920]   And we have a test called the hypnotic induction profile.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.520]   We give a highly structured hypnotic experience.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.640]   And you know, the old tradition in clinical hypnosis
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.040]   was that you try a bunch of different things,
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.480]   walking upstairs and downstairs and other images,
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.880]   and time what you say to the breathing
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.200]   of the subject and all that.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.900]   And the more you change what you do as a clinician,
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.040]   the less you can make a variation in outcome.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.880]   And it could take a long time, you know,
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.840]   20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.940]   And I just view that as a kind of complex,
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.660]   not very effective way of assessing
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.720]   the person's hypnotic capacity.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.160]   We know that the peak period of hypnotizability
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.200]   in the human life is the latency years in childhood.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.080]   So every eight-year-old is in a trance all the time.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.900]   You know, you call them in for dinner, they don't hear you.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.960]   They're doing their thing.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.520]   And that's why childhood is such a wonderful experience.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.840]   Work and play are all the same thing, you know.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.080]   And we try to make them into little adults,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.320]   which I think is a terrible mistake.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.560]   Everything is fun for them.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.680]   They enjoy learning, they enjoy everything.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.800]   - So what age are they in this?
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.240]   - This is like six to 10, six to 11.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.440]   They're playful, they enjoy everything.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.640]   Everything is sort of a game and fun.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.440]   And we try to make it miserable for them,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.960]   but they've got it.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.520]   And then when what Piaget called, you know,
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.680]   a more adult cognitive framework,
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.320]   where we learn abstract concepts,
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.280]   we learn that even if one bottle looks bigger
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.040]   than the other, they can have equal volume.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.080]   And so we start imposing logic.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.800]   We're growing our DLPFC at that point
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.960]   and imposing cognitive structure on experience.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.440]   Some people start to lose that hypnotic ability.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.840]   By the time you're in your early 20s,
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.960]   your hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.640]   And there was a study done at Stanford,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.000]   Ernest Hilgard, Phil Zimbardo did this,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.760]   looking at, they've tracked down students
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.960]   who were in psych one, had their hypnotizability measured,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.800]   and retested them blindly 25 years later.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.240]   And the test-retest correlation was,
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240]   you wanna guess what it was?
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.880]   - I'm guessing it's, I don't know, 0.6 something.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.160]   - Yeah, very close.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.240]   It was 0.7, IQ would be 0.6 on a 25 year interval.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.160]   So it's more stable than IQ over a 25 year interval.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.080]   So once you're at that point, that's where you are.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.560]   What are the factors that lead to that?
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.520]   Well, and so what it means is that about a third of adults
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.280]   are just not hypnotizable.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.760]   Two thirds are, about 15% are extremely hypnotizable.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.080]   And we can measure that and give it a number from zero to 10.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.360]   And that's very useful.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   For some of my patients when I do it,
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.160]   I say, look, I'm sorry, you're not hypnotizable,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.800]   we're gonna do something else.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.560]   Medication, systematic desensitization,
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.760]   mindfulness, other things.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.920]   Or if they're very hypnotizable, I just go for it.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.560]   I don't do a lot of explaining.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.120]   People who are low to moderate hypnotizable
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.960]   like explanations about what you're doing,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.160]   but then they can still get the benefits.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.280]   So it helps me guide the nature of my treatment
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.120]   with these people.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.760]   Now, the eye roll is, my father used to use
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.320]   an eye fixation induction.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.960]   He used to say, look up at the ceiling
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   and now close your eyes while you're looking up.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.640]   You're very, yes, you're very hypnotizable.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.560]   So he noticed he had two patients back to back.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.600]   And one was a woman who I'd seen him work with
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.960]   who had hysterical seizures.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.040]   She would just suddenly start shaking and--
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.400]   - Real epileptic seizures.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.560]   - No, pseudo epileptics.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.000]   - I see, so hysteria.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.360]   - Hysteria, and although some people have both,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.440]   that is for some people, real epilepsy
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.560]   becomes a framework that gets elaborated on
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   for when you're stressed, you have seizures.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.080]   She just had pseudo epilepsy, no EEG abnormalities.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.280]   And she, it was really something to watch.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.040]   Her husband had to move his workbench near the door
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.460]   so that if she started to have a seizure,
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.560]   he could run home and try and help her with it.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.000]   It was that bad.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   And he noticed that when she, she did what you did.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.560]   When she looked up, when she would have
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.360]   one of her seizure events, all you see is sclera.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.280]   You don't see iris anymore.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.440]   And she would start to see.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.600]   So he did a great thing with her.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.040]   He taught her to have seizures.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.160]   Everybody else was telling her to stop.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.040]   He made her have one.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.600]   So he hypnotized her, let's go back
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.760]   to the last time you had one.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.360]   And sure enough, she'd start to shake.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.480]   And gradually, he'd make them smaller and smaller.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.260]   So she was learning, she could control, she'd have access.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.800]   It's like with PTSD, you know, you confront,
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.780]   you don't avoid it, you don't suppress it.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.520]   You confront it and figure out how to deal with it.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.680]   The next patient he had was a rigid,
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.020]   obsessional businessman who wanted to stop, you know,
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.540]   being so controlling and all this.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.060]   Remind me, there was a New Yorker cartoon of a driver
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.620]   who comes to a yield sign and he yells, "Never!"
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.420]   You know, it's always being in control.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.260]   - That sounds about right.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.080]   You're a New Yorker.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.320]   - I'm a New Yorker, right.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.080]   And so this guy, when he tried to look up,
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.260]   he couldn't keep his eyes up while he closed them.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.520]   And so my father started testing people,
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.440]   and it seemed that there is a rough correlation
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   between the capacity to keep your eyes up
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.400]   while you close them and measured hypnotizability.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.000]   - So that people who are listening
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.120]   and watching on video.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.920]   So the Spiegler eye roll test involves looking up
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.640]   at the ceiling, so it's tilting the head back.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.780]   I'm tilting my chin back and looking up at the ceiling now,
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.080]   but I'm also directing my eyes upward and my eyes are open.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.680]   And then the eye roll test involves then closing the eyelids
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.300]   while the eyes are open and whether or not
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.200]   the eyes roll back.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.000]   And as you said, then you see sclera, the white part.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.840]   - You see sclera, the white part.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.720]   - That means you're very hypnotizable
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.440]   or moderately hypnotizable.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.840]   Whereas if the eyes move down and you see iris,
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.320]   the colored part of the eye, as the eyes close,
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.720]   less hypnotizable.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.520]   - Correct, and you can look this up online.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.880]   You just put Spiegler eye roll test and you'll find it.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.400]   And we are also going to do an actual example of hypnosis
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.560]   on video later.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.600]   - Right, so you're asking the brain to do something difficult
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.840]   to keep the eyes up while closing the eyelids.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.200]   And so that's contradictory signals for the third, fourth,
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.620]   and sixth cranial nerve nuclei that control eye movement.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.460]   - You said the third?
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.420]   - Fourth and sixth cranial nerve nuclei.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.820]   And so you're suspending one activity
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:04.020]   while asking them to do another.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.820]   And eye movements have a lot to do
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.420]   with levels of consciousness.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.780]   The periaqueductal gray surrounds
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.700]   these cranial nerve nuclei.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.420]   And when we close our eyes when we sleep,
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.480]   we have rapid eye movement when we dream.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   Most drugs that affect level of consciousness
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.340]   can affect eyes and eye movements,
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.220]   either the dilation or contraction of the pupils,
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.200]   depending on whether it's a stimulant or an opioid.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.380]   - Stimulants make the pupils big.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.240]   Yeah, like cocaine, amphetamine, things of that sort.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.720]   - And opioids, you get constricted pupils.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.880]   - This is what parents, you know,
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.080]   the parents looking at their kids
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.440]   coming in the door late at night.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.040]   They're looking for substance abuse.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.240]   - That's right.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.480]   So there's something about the eyes
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.440]   that has a lot to do with level of consciousness.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.180]   I mean, obviously you close your eyes when you go to sleep,
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.460]   you have rapid eye movement when you're dreaming.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.020]   So it's not surprising.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.760]   And there's an old zen practice
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.820]   called looking at the third eye.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.840]   And I think part of the reason that this happens
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.420]   is where you're looking up inside.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.480]   It's like there's a third eye
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.660]   between the other two in your forehead.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.260]   And I think it's because we're visual creatures.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.460]   You know, we're pretty pathetic
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.620]   from a physical point of view.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.180]   You know, many animals can outrun us, you know,
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.560]   and or out smell us or see, you know, eagles can read,
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.880]   could read the newsprint at a hundred yards
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.440]   and we can't, you know, it's.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.440]   So our major defensive sensory input is vision.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.140]   And that's why, you know, animals,
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.280]   predator animals have eyes in the front of their head
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.200]   so that they have very good detailed vision of prey.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.520]   Whereas prey animals like deer
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.900]   have eyes on the side of their head.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.140]   So they don't see things that well,
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:52.140]   but they have a much bigger range of potential to see threat.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.660]   And we mainly use, in fact, it's interesting.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.500]   There've been social anthropologists that say,
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.180]   why do we gather where we do, you know, on coastlines
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.940]   and, you know, at the edge of a forest or something?
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.500]   It's because you've got protection in the back.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.540]   Something can't attack you from one side
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.340]   and you have a big vision of what might threaten you.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.380]   And we tend to like be attracted
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:16.460]   to those kinds of physical situations.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.700]   - And we love vistas.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.540]   - We love vistas.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.540]   - Vistas are very calming.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.460]   They take us into that panoramic vision.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.280]   - That's right.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.500]   - I didn't know this, but it turns out
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.860]   that most of the scenic spots at any location
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.260]   in national parks and were where people naturally aggregated.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.820]   It wasn't, which makes sense, you know,
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.360]   but that those signs and locations were built up
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.100]   around people's tendency and animals tendencies
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.700]   to aggregate there.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.060]   Yeah, there's an interesting book on the history
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.940]   of the national parks that says
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.660]   that they didn't give a research study to support it,
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.540]   but there was no Google maps, obviously.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.580]   - That's very interesting.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.340]   - Yeah, panorama and visual boundaries
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.340]   are really interesting.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.860]   I think, so the eyes, as we both know,
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.980]   are two pieces of the central nervous system
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.300]   of the brain outside the,
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   I used to say that the eyes are outside the skull
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.620]   and a neuro-ophthalmologist said,
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:11.300]   there wrote to me and vehemently pointed out
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.340]   that they are outside the cranial vault.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.780]   So, you know, they're outside the cranial vault,
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.820]   but they are two pieces of brain, they're out there.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.980]   And so you mentioned cranial nerves, three, four, and six.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.340]   This isn't a neuroanatomy course,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.540]   but maybe we could go a little deeper there.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.620]   So there's, you said there's contradictory activity.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:31.460]   Looking up is controlled by the one set of cranial nerves
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.780]   and then the closing of the eyelids
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.740]   is controlled by another cranial nerve.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.900]   - No, it's the same one.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.900]   I think it's six that when you close your eyes,
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:46.500]   you activate, no, it's the facial,
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.940]   I guess it's the facial nerve, it's a seven.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.180]   - Seven, yeah. - Seven, yeah.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.460]   - But you're looking up, you're activating the muscles
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.060]   that force your eyes to look up
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:02.620]   and the closing your eyelids normally relaxes those,
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.300]   relaxes that upper movement because your eyes are closed
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.680]   and you don't need to do it.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.700]   So you're breaking a usual customary pattern.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.140]   - It's like the rubbery, the, hey, I can't even do it.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.100]   See, it's like, rubbing your tummy and patting your head,
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   it's a bit, there's a bit of a conflict there,
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.020]   but clinically it's been a good probe for you
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.300]   and for your father.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.340]   So was it Spiegel Senior or Spiegel Junior?
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.300]   - That's Spiegel Senior.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.700]   - That developed the Spiegel Eye Roll Test.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.080]   - But the key issue is this,
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.940]   that normally when we close our eyes also,
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.260]   we're going to sleep.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.020]   You're not worried about what's going on
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:36.940]   in the world anymore.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.140]   Here, you're maintaining resting alertness.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.940]   So you're focusing, but you're turning inward.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.260]   That's an unusual state.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.580]   Normally we don't, we close our eyes periodically.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.340]   We have to, but when you close your eyes
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.780]   for some period of time, it's normally to go to sleep
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.700]   and you're not worried about detecting risk or threat.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.620]   So it's an interesting state
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.140]   because you're turning inward basically.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.260]   You're looking up, you're shutting your eyes
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.780]   and you're allowing whatever happens outside you to happen
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.180]   and focusing on what's going on inward.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.980]   So I think it's a signal to your brain to turn inward.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.340]   - Very interesting.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.420]   And meditation of course could be done with eyes open,
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.560]   but almost always is done with eyes closed.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.100]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.340]   - Very interesting.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.020]   So you can very quickly determine
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.220]   whether or not someone is highly hypnotizable,
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.180]   not at all hypnotized.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.560]   When you say about two thirds of people can be hypnotized,
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.820]   obviously a third cannot,
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.980]   but within the two thirds that can, there's a range.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.660]   And you said 15% of people fall into this
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.740]   highly hypnotizable category
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.780]   that I seem to be a member of.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:48.240]   And does repeated use of self-hypnosis or clinical hypnosis
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.100]   increase or change hypnotizability
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.300]   for those that can access it in the first place?
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.800]   - I would say in general, it may increase a little bit,
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.980]   but not a hell of a lot.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.880]   And it's not worth the effort
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.220]   to increase your hypnotizability at that point.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.000]   It's worth trying to deal with the problem
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.020]   you're dealing with.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.780]   So you can get better at using it at the level that you have.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   There was a study done in which they tried to train people
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.960]   to be more hypnotizable.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.180]   And obviously there are subjective
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.580]   and behavioral components to the test.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.680]   You can learn to do a little better on them.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.300]   But what we found was when we reanalyzed this data
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.420]   that we could account for three times the final score
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.400]   based on the initial hypnotizability measurement
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.660]   rather than whether or not
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.060]   they had been trained to do better.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.940]   So you can improve it a little,
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.300]   but it's not worth the trouble.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.260]   - Got it.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.940]   Along the lines of eyes and eye movements,
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.900]   a lot of interest out there about EMDR,
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.060]   eye movement desensitization reprocessing.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.900]   Shapiro herself was working,
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.140]   she wasn't at Stanford directly,
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.380]   but was the local to Stanford, I think in Palo Alto.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.220]   So what are your thoughts on EMDR?
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.260]   Where is it useful?
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.500]   Where do you think it's less useful?
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.780]   Are there things that EMDR could be combined with
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.140]   to make it more useful?
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:08.460]   The listeners of this podcast come to,
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.100]   I think come to the podcast
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.060]   with a range of backgrounds and interests.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.220]   To me, it makes sense why EMDR,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.940]   lateralized eye movements might work given the newer data
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.740]   that it can suppress amygdala activity in some animals
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.580]   and animal models and in humans as well.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.920]   But it really hasn't been explored much neurally.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.500]   I've heard things like it coordinates
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.500]   the two sides of the brain,
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.300]   which to me is just a throwaway.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.580]   I don't think there's any evidence
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.480]   that coordinating the two sides of the brain
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.320]   is better than not coordinating.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.380]   I wouldn't be speaking right now
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.220]   if the two sides of my brain were well-correlated
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.820]   because language is lateralized.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.680]   So I've heard that it mimics rapid eye movements
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.520]   during sleep, but actually it doesn't.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.620]   So, but I have heard people talk about
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.220]   their positive experiences with EMDR.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.740]   What are your thoughts about EMDR?
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.420]   - Yeah, you had a good comment on that
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.800]   in one of your recent podcasts.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   And I'll tell you, one way I sort of think about it
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.840]   from a bemused point of view is the old,
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.840]   you mentioned it earlier,
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.100]   the oldest sort of idea of a hypnotic induction
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.340]   was a dangling watch, right, and a watch.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.600]   And in fact, there was enough concern about it
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.660]   that when automobiles were invented,
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:25.940]   there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.580]   because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.380]   if they watched the windshield wipers
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.580]   go back and forth on a car.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.120]   Now, it turns out, fortunately,
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.500]   that you tend not to look at the windshield wipers.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.900]   You keep looking through the windshield.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.720]   And so we have windshield wipers today.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.280]   But that movement is what exactly
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.740]   used to be a hypnotic induction.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:50.800]   I think there is a lot of hypnosis in EMDR.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.920]   And I think it's a combination of that
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.740]   with exposure-based treatments
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.760]   where you use EMDR to think about it.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.000]   You tend not to process the experience as much
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.100]   and just do the physical part of it,
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.340]   which I personally think is a drawback.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.400]   And every study I've seen that was a dismantling study,
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.760]   there's no question that people who go through EMDR,
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.640]   many of them get better with trauma-related problems,
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.440]   and the VA has a big program using it and so on.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.580]   But every program that has dismantled
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.800]   going through the treatment
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.760]   with having the lateral eye movement
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.360]   has shown that the lateral eye movement
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.840]   doesn't add anything to it.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.860]   And toward the end of her career,
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.440]   Francine was doing now contralateral touching or something.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.880]   It wasn't eye movements anymore.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.720]   It was other things.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.400]   So I tend to think that EMDR
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.660]   is another form of exposure-based therapy for trauma.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.940]   But as you've implied,
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.480]   with the exception of this possible new data,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.920]   it certainly doesn't have to do
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.760]   with rapid eye movement, sleep.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.400]   And I don't think moving the eyes is the issue.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.520]   I think it's a way of sitting down and confronting trauma.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.600]   And I would rather that the trauma itself
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.120]   be processed a bit more than often happens in the EMDR.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.200]   So a lot of people have gotten therapy.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.520]   Some of them have been helped.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.480]   Francine used to originally claim
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.360]   that just one session would desensitize people and do it.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.960]   And that's clearly not true.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.400]   I see a lot of people who said,
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.800]   "Yeah, it helped for a while, but I need more."
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   So I think it became a kind of overly simplistic approach
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:30.400]   to understanding brain physiology, and that part is wrong.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.040]   And the interesting thing,
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.680]   you mentioned suppressing amygdala activity.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:39.480]   It's very interesting that my late friend, Alan Hobson,
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.140]   who was a brilliant sleep researcher, you know Alan.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.160]   - Well, I don't know him, but I read his book
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.840]   when I was in college about the chemistry of sleep
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.840]   and the similarities between dream states and hallucinations.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.520]   And it's one of the reasons I got into this business.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.920]   - Yes, well, I worked with him
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.280]   in a MacArthur mind-body network for many years.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.840]   And a brilliant guy points out that we need to get
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.960]   into primarily a parasympathetic state to go to sleep,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.700]   that we have to shut off the sympathetic nervous system.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.560]   And that's why a loud noise wakes you up
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.520]   when your heart rate goes up and all this.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.000]   So he was brilliant at documenting what happens
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:17.840]   in the brain of sleep.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.820]   He pointed out something also very interesting about dreams,
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.560]   which is that the stories in dreams and even the images
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.440]   in dreams can change all over the place in crazy ways,
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.380]   but usually the affect is constant.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.680]   So usually if it's a frustration dream,
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.600]   whatever happens, you wind up frustrated.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.840]   And if it's a enjoyment dream,
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.680]   you enjoy whatever's going on.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.220]   So there's an odd consistency and affect in dreams
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.960]   that you don't have in other states.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.880]   And the idea of lateral eye movement
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.340]   suppressing amygdala activity would kind of fit with that,
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:54.360]   that you don't allow intrusions of fear and anger
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.600]   and upset in dreams.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.980]   It may be there all the time,
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.660]   but it may not be there when you think it should be.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.080]   So why is it that you can be falling off a building
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.780]   and somehow not that scared?
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.840]   You're just having this experience of flying in a dream.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.980]   So I think there may be something going on
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.200]   about regulating affect,
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.700]   but we have elaborate and better ways to regulate affect.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.240]   - Great, so EMDR might incorporate some elements
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.920]   of hypnosis by, so the lateral eye movements,
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.800]   perhaps by way of suppressing the amygdala,
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.080]   this fear associated center might bring people
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.240]   into a more parasympathetic calm state.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.160]   So it might be pseudo hypnosis and then exposure therapy
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.080]   through the discussion about the issue.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.680]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.400]   More research needed on EMDR out there.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.700]   And obviously something that's come up a lot
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.540]   in this discussion and in our discussions
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.660]   that I have the great fortune of talking to you every week
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.540]   is, and working together,
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:55.540]   is this idea of getting close to the phobia,
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:57.740]   getting close to the trauma,
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.100]   re-experiencing it as a portal
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.420]   to then adjusting the response to it
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.920]   and rewiring something.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.540]   So the troubling thing or the horrible thing
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.720]   is no longer as horrible to us.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:14.600]   But the repeating theme is we can't expect
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.160]   to get over something without getting really close to it,
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.420]   maybe even experiencing it somatically.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.760]   Nowadays, we hear a lot about triggers and trigger warnings,
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   and certainly one can understand why those exist.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.700]   But it seems like there's a, in the general population,
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.120]   there's this idea that we want to move away
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.480]   from anything that upsets us.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.240]   And yet I think it's fair to say,
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.660]   even though having gathered the statistics that on the whole,
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.480]   that the human beings are becoming more and more anxious
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.900]   and more and more stressed, perhaps because of,
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.680]   but certainly in parallel with the fact
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.640]   that we're trying to move away from troubling things,
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.520]   troubling things.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.520]   So I've heard you say before that it's,
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.200]   in terms of therapeutic approaches,
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.400]   it's not just about the state you get into,
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.960]   but whether or not you brought yourself there voluntarily.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.800]   - That's exactly right.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.440]   - So this element of deliberate self-exposure,
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.320]   deciding I'm going to confront the trauma,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.000]   I'm going to confront the pain,
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.040]   I'm going to confront the insomnia,
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.800]   I'm going to confront the, you know, and fill in the blank.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.560]   And then readjusting one's emotional response
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.060]   right up next to that troubling thing.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.240]   That seems to be the hallmark of this treatment.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.560]   And if I'm thinking about it correctly,
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   of pretty much all treatments for getting over stuff,
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.320]   if people don't have access to a really good clinician
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.600]   like yourself,
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.900]   how should they carry these thoughts and these ideas?
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:49.240]   I mean, I think almost everybody of any reasonable age
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.260]   has memories or things that upset them,
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.880]   but we learn to suppress them.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.820]   What does one do?
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.120]   Obviously the Reverie app has approaches to dealing
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.440]   with some of this inside of the app,
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.260]   but how does one start to think about actually dealing
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.040]   with something like this and avoiding the hazards
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.860]   of just kind of reactivating a lot of painful experiences?
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.760]   Because a lot of being a functional human being
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.400]   is also going to work each day, interacting with people
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.200]   and not bringing one's trauma, you know,
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.120]   and dumping it out all on the table
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.760]   or being able to just function is so crucial.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.420]   So how do you think about this as a clinician?
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.260]   - Well, you know,
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:28.860]   the image that comes to mind is the Greek myth of Pandora's
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.360]   box, you know, that it opened and the furies got out
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.300]   and you couldn't put them back in.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.980]   And we have this kind of fantasy that once you get
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.460]   into these memories, they'll take you over
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.580]   and you'll never get them back in the box.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:41.980]   And I think that's wrong.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.060]   You know, people who use hypnosis say that there are ways
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.380]   to present things to people that will be helpful
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.700]   in ways that won't.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.800]   And one real mistake is to tell someone,
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.620]   don't think about purple elephants.
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.220]   You know, what are you thinking about?
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.600]   You know, it doesn't work.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:01.100]   So you want to find a way to feel in control of the access
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.460]   and to define what happened on your own terms.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.860]   And so I'm not a big fan of trigger warnings.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.040]   I think we're going crazy over, you know,
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.780]   this could be upsetting, that could be upsetting.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.360]   Yeah, there are lots of things that are upsetting.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.220]   You know, the average kid has watched 20,000 murders
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.700]   by the time he's 20 years old watching television
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.260]   and movies these days.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   So, you know, we see terrible things
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:25.540]   and it's not a matter of are you exposed to something
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:28.100]   that's upsetting, but how do you handle it?
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:28.960]   What do you make of it?
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.360]   And are you feeling in control?
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.300]   It's not like, you know, what Putin is doing
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.660]   to his rival in Russia, you know,
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.340]   forcing him to watch propaganda movies 10 hours a day
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.780]   while he's in prison.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   It's a matter of thinking about a problem
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.180]   in a way that leaves you feeling you understand it better,
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:50.980]   you're in more control, you can turn it off
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.260]   when you want, you can turn it on when you want.
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.280]   And so we have to, in life, deal with stressful things.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.800]   There are studies, Karen Parker at Stanford
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.660]   has done some wonderful studies with primates
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:05.640]   about stress inoculation, that if you separate
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.920]   a baby monkey from his mother for two hours a day
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.460]   and then reunite them, and then you stress
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.880]   that baby monkey later, they actually handle stress better.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.600]   There's less cortisol arousal in the face of the stress.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.360]   Stress inoculation, it's been called.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.280]   So mere exposure to trauma or stress,
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.860]   it's a part of living anyway.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.160]   We can't avoid it even if we'd like to.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.200]   And it's not pleasant, it's not great,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.680]   but it's sometimes things you need to learn about life.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.400]   And if you can find an algorithm for facing it,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.440]   putting it into perspective, dealing with it,
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.820]   you become a stronger person, not a weaker person.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:44.680]   So this idea that college students are such fragile flowers
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.060]   that if you talk about a sexual assault or something,
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.320]   you know, you're doing something terrible to them,
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.360]   it's just wrong.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.440]   And I think we need to build our ability
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.260]   to recognize and manage stress.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.040]   And you can't do that without doing it.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.400]   You can't learn, or you can't ride a bicycle
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.760]   without taking the risk of falling off it, you know?
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.440]   And so I think that's the way I think
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.320]   of dealing with stress.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.080]   - Yeah, I really appreciate you saying that.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.160]   I was, you and I were both at a gathering,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.920]   let's say where this issue was being discussed
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.680]   and around an issue of a publicized sexual trauma
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.920]   and you made an excellent case for why
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.980]   this stuff can't be pushed under the rug.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:27.520]   And that actually, in my observation,
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.400]   led to a lot of healing for the people that,
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.620]   and the families of people that suffered from this.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.280]   I do think people are resilient,
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.160]   but we don't really teach how to think about feelings.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.200]   You know, we don't, you know,
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.060]   we're told that we need to feel our feelings,
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:45.160]   but then again, we are also told
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.080]   that feelings don't hold all the information.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.560]   And so I think that, as you mentioned,
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.200]   there's no operating or user's manual
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.320]   for this nervous system thing.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.560]   Brings me to another issue,
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.000]   which is the mind-body connection,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.800]   something that we're very interested in
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.880]   and you've done extensive work on.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.720]   We all like to think that getting more in touch
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.560]   with our body would be a great thing.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.680]   Learning to intercept,
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.400]   paying attention to our internal landscape
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.220]   would be a great thing.
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:13.200]   But as we often discuss, when we're feeling lousy,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.880]   then being really in touch with that lousy feeling
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.040]   may or may not be a good thing, right?
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.400]   So how should we think about mind-body?
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.880]   I can see examples in hypnosis,
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.460]   from your descriptions of hypnosis,
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.920]   where you want to unify the mind-body connection,
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.760]   feel what you're thinking,
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.320]   think what you're feeling, et cetera.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.120]   But I could also point to elements
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.520]   within the hypnotic process
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.360]   in which you are actively trying to uncouple those.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.400]   So it sounds to me like this whole mind-body thing
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.140]   is a bit more like a car.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.760]   You can't say that 40 miles per hour is the optimal speed.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.640]   It kind of depends on the road you're on
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.740]   and the turn you may or may not be taking.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.400]   How should we think about mind-body
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.060]   in terms of navigating daily life?
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.960]   What do you think is the adaptive way
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.020]   to conceptualize the mind-body?
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.300]   It's a big question.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.720]   - It is, it's a very interesting one.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.720]   I guess I think that it's a matter not of,
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.540]   absolute control, but more control,
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:23.460]   that we need to think of our brain as a tool,
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.660]   and our body signals as tools as well,
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.940]   to help us understand what's going on in the world,
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:33.380]   what we need, what matters, what's important, what isn't.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.220]   But also something that can be managed,
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.240]   not simply absorbed.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.520]   And so hypnosis, I think, is a kind of limiting case
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.780]   where you can push it about as far as we can push it
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:48.680]   in terms of regulating pain.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.680]   Pain is a good example of that.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.600]   Obviously, you need to pay attention.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.680]   If you just broke your ankle,
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.780]   you better pay attention to it and get help,
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.340]   or you're having crushing substernal chest pain.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.840]   You better do something about it.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.180]   But our brain is sort of programmed
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:06.260]   to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:09.580]   if it's a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:13.140]   I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:17.860]   Does the pain mean that if you put weight on this,
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.940]   you're gonna re-injure your ankle, for example?
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.040]   Or does it simply mean that your body is healing
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.420]   and the pain is a sign that gradually
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.200]   things are getting back to normal?
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:31.720]   And so you can modify the way you process pain
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.480]   based on what your brain tells you the pain means.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.740]   And that's true for emotional pain as well.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:42.060]   And particularly where I think a strategy that really helps
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:45.880]   is if you think of an interpersonal problem
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:50.880]   or a threat of something coming as an opportunity
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.580]   to do something to ameliorate the situation.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.120]   So it's not just it's happening to you,
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.480]   but something that you can influence and do something about.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.100]   So it's blending the receptive with the active response
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.340]   that I think can make a difference.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.940]   So you try and process it in a way
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.460]   that gives you a deeper understanding of what's happening.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.940]   You face it, but you also say this is an opportunity
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.620]   for me to do something about it.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.340]   And the minute you realistically enhance,
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.900]   and this doesn't mean imagine a way, a heart attack,
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:24.540]   it means figure out how to rehabilitate from a heart attack
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.300]   or a broken leg or something like that
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.100]   in a way that you get as much control
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:32.640]   into the situation as you can.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.480]   - I love it.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.800]   Grief.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.700]   Grief is one of those states that is very hard
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:42.800]   to remove oneself from, you know?
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.240]   And a lot of people ask me, how do I deal with grief?
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.500]   And I'm not a clinician, so I'm deferring to you.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.660]   On the one hand, actually someone at Stanford recently
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.740]   came to me and said, you know, my mother passed away
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:56.100]   and I had a sibling that passed away
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.540]   and they were the only people that I had.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:00.300]   And I'm also living alone and I'm challenged
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.180]   with a number of things.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:04.140]   And they looked like they were holding it together
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.420]   very well, in fact, given what they were describing.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:12.740]   And on the one hand, well, I certainly pointed out
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.820]   that I'm not a clinician, but I said on the one hand,
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:17.580]   you could imagine that it would be necessary and useful
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.020]   to go into the grief state
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.860]   if you want to transition through it.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:25.580]   On the other hand, I've heard before
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:29.380]   that the cathartic model of just really diving
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.780]   into an emotion can also be potentially hazardous
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   if you don't have any anchors to grab onto.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:41.700]   What is the view of psychiatry or your view of grief
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.000]   and how to deal with grief?
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.620]   Because I think grief is one of those all-encompassing
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.500]   emotions for many people.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.260]   - It is, and it's a very important, natural,
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.580]   necessary stage of life.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.080]   And the reason we have all these grief rituals
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:59.340]   from burials and memorials and headstones
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:02.140]   and sitting Shiva and other things that people do,
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:06.420]   it's a way of making it real that an incomprehensible loss
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:08.100]   has to be comprehended.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.820]   You have to realize that you're now gonna have to live life
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:14.500]   without your loved one, your parent, your sibling, whoever.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:18.260]   And we've all gone through this at one time or another.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:19.680]   I certainly have.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.860]   And it's very hard to just come to terms with,
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:26.200]   but one principle is to sort of say,
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.500]   it's never all or none, it's more or less.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.980]   So yes, it's all or none that you've lost a loved one.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.820]   But I ask people as part of their grieving
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.060]   to say to themselves, and I do this in hypnosis sometimes
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:44.060]   too, you've lost them, but what have they left you with?
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:47.220]   What have they bequeathed to you even though they're gone?
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.260]   And I'll sometimes ask them to say,
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:51.500]   if your mother could be here right now,
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.260]   what would she say to you?
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.020]   How would she feel about your life now?
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.960]   What would she advise you to do?
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.000]   So in our support groups for women with advanced breast
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.200]   cancer, we lost people.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.780]   And I gotta tell you that we were warned by oncologists
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.880]   that we demoralize people that,
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.320]   I mean, they were wonderful oncologists,
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.960]   but there were some that were very afraid
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.000]   that we would harm them in some way,
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.540]   because the mortality rate is fairly high
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.240]   with metastatic breast cancer.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.100]   They're gonna watch people die of the same disease
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.060]   and you'll demoralize them.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:25.880]   So we actually measured their emotion
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.180]   and the content of speech every five minutes
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.820]   throughout a bunch of groups to make sure
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:30.660]   that wasn't happening.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.740]   What we found was that they talked about more serious issues
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:35.820]   but the mood didn't actually get worse.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.960]   And we found in general that expressing negative emotion
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.140]   on the long run helps people be less anxious
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:42.100]   and depressed over time.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.300]   And we've shown this in randomized clinical trials,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.180]   so it's not just my clinical impression.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:52.180]   And what we try to get them to do is to face a loss,
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.200]   live with the emotion that comes with it,
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.780]   but also see that the reason it hurts so much
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.500]   is how much that person gave you.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.580]   So we would do a self-hypnosis exercise at the end of the group
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.660]   and say, I want you to get your body floating
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.940]   safe and comfortable.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.480]   Now picture Mary and sit with the feeling of sadness
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.420]   that she's no longer with us.
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.920]   And we do that for a few minutes.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.700]   And then we'd say on the other side,
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:19.620]   picture one thing she left with you that you still have,
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.500]   that you carry on in your heart her tradition
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500]   of what she gave to you.
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:28.080]   And so just seeing it not as a complete loss,
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.740]   but as a real loss, a painful loss,
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:33.540]   but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.680]   from her and knowing her,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.540]   I think can be very helpful in the grieving process.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.060]   - That's very helpful, the way to conceptualize it.
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:43.540]   Couple quick questions.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.800]   Can children be safely hypnotized or do self-hypnosis?
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.840]   - It's sometimes harder for them to do self-hypnosis.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.560]   They need more structure to do it.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.340]   You've got to share your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:35:59.660]   with them a little bit.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.820]   But yes, absolutely.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.980]   Children can be very hypnotizable.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   And I know pediatricians who use it wonderfully all the time.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:10.780]   They get them to focus on something else.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.560]   So they're going to have to give them a shot
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.180]   or draw blood or something.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:18.360]   And they'll say, I'm going to press your happy button
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.000]   and presses their belly button.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.800]   And they start to giggle the way kids do.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.400]   And meanwhile, the nurse is drawing the blood
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.180]   and they don't even notice it.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.900]   Dentists, good dentists can use it to help kids
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.340]   with fear and pain.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.700]   So yes, it can be very effective for children.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.000]   We did a randomized trial.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.940]   I have a publication in pediatrics.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.900]   My late sister who was a pediatrician
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:41.620]   and who always used to joke that she was the only one
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.420]   in our family who was a real doctor.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:47.900]   I said, I got you, I got a paper in pediatrics.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.000]   And the paper was children having to undergo avoiding
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.140]   cystourethrograms.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.880]   So the anatomy of the kidney, if you'll forgive me,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.000]   is sort of interesting in that the ureter
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.200]   that goes into the bladder normally goes into the bladder
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.120]   at an angle.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.800]   And so that means that when the bladder contracts
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   to expel urine, it automatically closes off the ureter
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.820]   because it's sideways to the bladder.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:14.880]   Some kids are born with it perpendicular
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.160]   and then you'll get reflux into the kidney.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.220]   And some children outgrow it.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.620]   Some need pretty complicated surgery to fix that.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.980]   And so you image them every year or so
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.640]   to see whether they're getting kidney damage or not.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.440]   And it's a pretty miserable experience.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.000]   You're a nine-year-old girl.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.880]   You have to go and lie on a hard, cold table,
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.400]   have strangers pull your legs apart and stick a catheter
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.040]   into your urethra and hold in the bladder
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.680]   and then expel urine.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.800]   And so you get into these struggling fights.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.120]   And of course, the more they struggle,
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.540]   the more they constrict and it makes it harder to do it.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:51.000]   So I was asked if we could test it.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.080]   So we did a randomized trial at Children's Hospital.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.240]   They either got training in self-hypnosis.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.200]   I would meet with them and the mother the week before.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.440]   We find out from the kids where they like to be.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.660]   And I'd say, "You're gonna play a trick on your doctors.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.500]   "Your body's there.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:05.500]   "You're somewhere else.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.600]   "Go visit your friend.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.440]   "Go to Disneyland.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.280]   "Do something else."
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.060]   And the mother would work on this with me
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.600]   at the head of the table.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.280]   And we found that these children were much easier to image.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:17.400]   One got so relaxed.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.840]   He said, "Normally, it takes us 10 minutes
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.160]   "to get them to pee after they're doing this."
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.780]   She was so relaxed, she started peeing
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:25.100]   before I could even get the bedpan under her
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.200]   and I had to clean up the table.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.400]   And they also, 17 minutes shorter procedures.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.800]   And that's a long 17 minutes for a little kid.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.560]   So it can be very effective with children.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.440]   They're less anxious.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.160]   They have less pain and get through
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.360]   these difficult procedures very well.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.600]   - That's great.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.480]   Has hypnosis ever been done for couples,
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.560]   like couples therapy?
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.860]   I'm thinking of pretty much every clinical setting here.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.480]   Both people have to be hypnotizable, of course.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.680]   But the reason I ask about this is next,
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.480]   I'm gonna ask about psychedelics.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.620]   And there's a lot of interest in coordinating states
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:04.040]   through the use of drugs of different kinds.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.840]   We actually do this when we treat depression, right?
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.360]   You have a depressed person with a family members
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.260]   who are not depressed and you say,
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:13.080]   "Well, let's make them all not depressed," right?
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.960]   I mean, but in all, and I'm only half kidding there
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.480]   because that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.480]   But are you aware of any coordinated hypnosis?
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.560]   - That's interesting.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.880]   I mean, I've done plenty of it in groups, not with couples.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.880]   - You can hypnotize large groups at once?
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:30.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.540]   - Are we hypnotized right now?
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.480]   - Yeah, you are.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.080]   I hope you've been enjoying it.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:39.700]   But the metastatic breast cancer, there was a group
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.680]   of like 10 women who would meet once a week
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.500]   and we would all go into hypnosis together.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.600]   - I didn't realize that you were hypnotizing them
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:47.440]   collectively.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.860]   - Yes, yes, right.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.700]   - Fascinating.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:52.600]   - And that, if anything, I think it brings out the best
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.620]   in people's abilities because it's a shared
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:59.280]   social experience and they would talk about it afterwards.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.540]   And so yes, that's absolutely doable, yeah.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.180]   - And I don't wanna focus on psychedelics specifically.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.920]   Maybe that's a topic for a future episode,
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.720]   but is there any basis for combining hypnosis
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.500]   with drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode?
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:18.560]   So I realize that some patients of yours might be prescribed
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.380]   a antidepressant or a medication for some purpose,
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:25.080]   maybe same or different than the hypnosis
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.540]   is being directed toward.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.900]   But is there any evidence that if people are relaxed
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.220]   through the use of a propranolol or some, you know,
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.260]   one of these many things in the psychiatrist's kit,
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:40.180]   that hypnosis can be more effective?
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:44.020]   - Well, interestingly, one study that I haven't mentioned
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:49.020]   is we did spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:53.380]   And we found that there was a correlation
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:57.620]   between hypnotizability and GABA activity
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.980]   in the anterior cingulate cortex,
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:02.460]   which fits with turning down activity.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.040]   So to the extent that we can self-medicate
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.500]   and GABA receptors basically are doing
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:10.500]   what benzodiazepines do to the brain,
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.020]   that can happen when people are hypnotized.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.500]   - So you're saying inside of the hypnosis,
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.140]   you have neural evidence that there's a kind of
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:22.060]   a sedative effect of hypnosis at the chemical level?
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.340]   - Yeah, right, right.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:24.700]   The people who are more hypnotizable
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.520]   have more of those GABA receptors
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.260]   and it's related to the degree of their hypnotizability.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.380]   In terms of, there have been studies
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:35.220]   where they try to give people medications as well.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.740]   And the interesting thing with benzodiazepines,
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.320]   which activate inhibitory activity in the brain,
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.380]   if you're very anxious,
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.380]   it might improve your hypnotic response a bit.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.620]   If you're just so anxious and you can't do it.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:49.740]   If you're not very anxious,
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:52.100]   it actually inhibits hypnotic activity
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.400]   because you get sort of sedated and just out of it
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.740]   and you can't focus your attention as well.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.740]   So by and large, we don't use drugs as an adjuvant
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.040]   to hypnotic experience.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.340]   Most of the time you don't need to
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:08.300]   and sometimes it can make it worse rather than better.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:12.380]   There's some evidence that mild stimulants
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:15.360]   might enhance hypnotic responsiveness a little reliably,
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.860]   but too much will again scatter attention
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.540]   and you'll have less control over it.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.600]   So they might be adjuvants,
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.740]   but I frankly think hypnosis is more of a replacement
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.520]   than a need of supplementation.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.780]   - Your laboratory, my laboratory have, well,
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.460]   sort of snuck into your lab
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.300]   and then trying to kind of merge the two.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.780]   It's been a lot of fun
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.200]   and learning a lot about the power of respiration
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.240]   of breathing to shift brain states,
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:47.060]   not just during breathing protocols, but at all times.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.660]   And we will do an entire episode about those protocols.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:54.560]   I think after those are published and so on.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.120]   But breathing itself is, you've described as a bridge
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.440]   between conscious and unconscious states.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.560]   And so I have to ask how important
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.000]   is the patient's breathing pattern?
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.220]   How closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern?
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:13.600]   How closely do you monitor your own breathing pattern
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.460]   as you're inducing hypnosis?
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.840]   Put simply, what is the role of respiration
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.840]   in shifting the brain's state during a hypnotic protocol?
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:24.620]   - Yeah, that's very interesting.
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:29.620]   You had a great show with Jack Feldman, and he is.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:35.200]   And the issue, I watch it, I try,
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.320]   the work that we're enjoying doing together
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.900]   shows that there are breathing patterns
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:46.460]   that may increase sympathetic arousal or may decrease.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.020]   It may help in cyclic sighing seems to actually
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.500]   where you have more time spent exhaling than inhaling.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.620]   And there's reason to believe
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:58.220]   that it induces parasympathetic activity
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.720]   'cause you're increasing pressure in the chest.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.440]   And therefore, allowing the heart to slow down
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.700]   because blood is being returned to the atrium more easily.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.620]   I do use it, I ask people to take a deep breath
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.080]   as part of the induction and then slowly exhale.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.240]   And partly as a result of our research together,
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.580]   I'm emphasizing this slow exhale more
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.860]   to enhance the idea in the induction
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.620]   that this is a period of relaxation
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:28.260]   'cause I think they are inducing that
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.940]   and perhaps perceiving it as well.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:34.220]   So there's no, you're absolutely right
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.660]   that breathing is very interesting
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.300]   'cause it's right at the edge of conscious,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.700]   and Jack talked about that too,
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.340]   of conscious and unconscious control,
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:44.900]   that it will go on automatically, but we can control it.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:48.380]   And so it's a kind of way for us to demonstrate to ourselves
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.280]   greater ways of modulating our internal state.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.340]   So you can either do it thinking about it
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.940]   the way we do with pain control and hypnosis,
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.460]   or you can do it to some extent
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:03.660]   by taking charge of your breathing
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.960]   and doing things that will produce a change
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.060]   that you wanna see happen in your body.
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:11.020]   So I like it because it's right at that margin
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.360]   where you can enhance.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.540]   For me, I like that as a way of augmenting hypnosis
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:17.760]   more than medication.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.720]   I think this is a powerful way of doing that.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.600]   - Great, I'm really excited to see where all of this goes.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.420]   Breathing, vision, bodily states,
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:31.420]   clearly the directed mental focus
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:34.960]   seem to be the key elements of hypnosis.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.160]   Am I missing any other ingredients?
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.880]   - Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:40.920]   - Breathing, vision?
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.540]   - Breathing, vision, how you change your vision.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.520]   Typically, you're in a physically relaxed state,
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.840]   but frankly, there are people at the peak of performance,
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.000]   including physical athletic performance
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.640]   or musical performance,
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.560]   when they're in hypnotic states too.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.560]   I've talked to classical pianists who say,
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.560]   if I start thinking about what my fingers are doing,
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.760]   now I screw up.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.300]   I'm floating above the piano thinking about the tone
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.520]   that I want to feel exuding from the instrument.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.520]   So that's a hypnotic-like state too.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.200]   And many athletes who are in peak performance
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.080]   are just flowing with it.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.280]   They're not thinking step by step, what am I doing?
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.000]   And that's when you're doing your best.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   Or when we're working or giving a talk and doing it well,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.720]   we're in a hypnotic-like state.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.680]   So it usually requires,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.200]   but doesn't necessarily require physical comfort
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.000]   or quietness, it can sometimes be intense activity.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.280]   - Incredible.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.640]   Well, this has been an amazing discussion.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.040]   I've learned so much that I always do from you.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.400]   Where can people learn more about
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.840]   how they can get hypnotized?
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.680]   We mentioned Reverie, we will put a link to it.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.280]   It's R-E-V-E-R-I.com is the way to access that.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.280]   - Or it's the Reverie app from the app store
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.120]   is the other way.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.420]   Reverie.com is the website.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.560]   You can get to it through that
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.840]   or download the Reverie app from the app store.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.680]   - Great.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:18.840]   So currently on Apple, hopefully soon, also on Android.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.320]   But in the meantime,
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:24.280]   what if people are interested in exploring clinical hypnosis
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.240]   working with you or somebody similar?
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.760]   Is there a centralized resource that people can go to
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.200]   to find really well-trained hypnotists?
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.840]   - There are two good professional organizations
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.740]   that will help you with that.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.560]   One is the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.980]   And I think that's S-C-E-H dot U-S is their website.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:48.160]   - We'll look it up and provide a link.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.380]   - And the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis.
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:55.380]   And they both provide referral services for professionals.
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:56.600]   You can look it up.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.100]   I would just say in general,
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:00.840]   look for someone who is licensed and trained
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.780]   in their primary professional discipline,
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:06.520]   psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry,
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.680]   and who has training and interest in using hypnosis
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.180]   is a way to do it.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:12.020]   - Great.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.180]   And then one more question and then a comment.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.320]   The question is, will you be my psychiatrist?
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.580]   (laughing)
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.420]   - I'm honored, I'm honored.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:22.200]   - It's a tall task.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.500]   I might be the most stubborn patient.
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.600]   - I think the hardest work's already been done, Andrew.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.440]   - Thank you.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.280]   - You're fine now.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.120]   - Appreciate that.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.860]   Well, and the final thing is a comment.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:35.180]   First of all, thank you so much for being here today,
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.400]   for sharing your knowledge.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.880]   I hope we can do it again and again.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.720]   - I hope so.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.920]   - I love working with your laboratory and with you.
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.760]   - Likewise.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.640]   - Because when you speak, I learn,
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.900]   and I know others do as well.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:49.980]   We will put resources to get to you.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.000]   But I also just want to say thank you
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.620]   for doing the work that you do.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:57.600]   It's an incredible thing that in this world
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.520]   where we are discovering so much about how the body works,
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.760]   the mind is still rather mysterious
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.520]   and people are struggling with a lot of things.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:06.920]   But also I think people are really excited about
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.240]   applying tools like hypnosis to perform better,
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:11.700]   feel better mentally and physically.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.080]   And so you've pointed us to a tremendous amount of resources
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.600]   and how these tools work
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.520]   and where they've already been demonstrated to work.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.000]   So just thank you.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.080]   I know this is your life's professional commitment in life
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.500]   and we all benefit.
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.340]   So thank you so much. - Well, thank you.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:28.740]   But it's been a real joy for me
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.340]   to be collaborating with you
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:33.120]   and for you to be using your precision and knowledge
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.360]   about neuroanatomy, neurobiology to address problems
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.320]   that often people who are that disciplined
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.200]   in the primary neurobiological end
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.900]   aren't as interested in as you are.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.360]   And so it's really been a pleasure
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.780]   to try and bring together what we both know
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.320]   from these different perspectives
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.520]   to build something that neither of us could do alone.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.120]   And so it's been a real joy for me to do it.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:57.320]   - Thank you, I'm honored.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.160]   - Thank you.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:58.980]   - Thank you very much, David.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:00.580]   - You're welcome.
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:01.720]   - Thank you for joining me today
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.000]   for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.860]   I hope you found it as fascinating as I did.
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:08.280]   And if you'd like to see the video
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.500]   of Dr. Spiegel hypnotizing me
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.120]   in what constitutes a abbreviated clinical hypnosis session,
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.600]   you can go to the Huberman Lab Clips channel on YouTube.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.540]   Also, if you'd like to check out the Reverie app
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.620]   for self-hypnosis designed by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues,
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:26.440]   you can go to Reverie, that's R-E-V-E-R-I.com
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.620]   to see the Reverie app.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.980]   There's also other information there
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.780]   about the scientific studies that support the Reverie app.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:34.200]   If you're enjoying and/or learning from this podcast,

[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:01.040]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.260]   We also have a Patreon,
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:05.020]   that's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.900]   and there you can support the podcast
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.500]   at any level that you like.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.820]   On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.140]   we discussed supplements.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:13.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:16.220]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.460]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:19.780]   and various other aspects
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.000]   of brain and body health and performance.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.380]   One issue with supplements, however,
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.400]   is that many of the supplements out there
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.140]   simply do not contain what's listed on the bottle
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:31.900]   and/or the quality of the ingredients is not very high.
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:34.140]   That's why we partnered with Thorne supplements.
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.740]   Thorne supplements are used by all the major sports teams
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.860]   and they partnered with the Mayo Clinic.
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.060]   The reason they have so many high-level partners
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.340]   is that Thorne supplements
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:44.740]   are of the very highest quality ingredients.
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.820]   They also are extremely precise
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.780]   in terms of what's listed on the bottle
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:50.540]   is always what's in the bottle.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.640]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:57.640]   you can go to Thorne, that's t-h-o-r-n-e.com/u/huberman,
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.140]   and there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:02.620]   and get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.860]   Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:09.860]   through that portal, t-h-o-r-i-n-e.com/u/huberman,
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.580]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.940]   that Thorne makes.
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.480]   If you're not already following us on Instagram and Twitter,
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.320]   please do so.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.340]   It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter,
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.820]   and at those channels,
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.700]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:26.020]   some of which overlap with the content of this podcast,
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:28.680]   other of which does not and is unique content.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:30.220]   So once again, thank you for joining me
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.260]   for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.460]   and last, but certainly not least,
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:36.340]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.920]   [upbeat music]
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.500]   (upbeat music)
