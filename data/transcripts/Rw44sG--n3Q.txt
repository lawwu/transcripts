[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   we welcome you back tonight to our 19th class meeting of Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.400]   It's a great joy to gather tonight in this webinar format and to continue our study of
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.240]   the Word of God. I just want to thank you for your faithfulness to this time, and thank you
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.520]   for your diligent study in the Word, and it's a great joy to be able to partner with you as you
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480]   continue your training in biblical counseling. We're so excited about what God is doing in the
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.680]   biblical counseling movement. As you know, tomorrow begins the ACBC National Conference, which is all
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.200]   going to be offered online this year, and if you haven't registered for that, I believe that there
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.160]   will be the videos made available after the conference is completed, but we are looking
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.120]   forward to a wonderful time hearing from the Word of God as a number of great speakers speak
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.920]   on the subject of spiritual warfare in biblical counseling ministry. I'm thankful to have
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.480]   my own senior pastor, Pastor Philip DeCourcy, as one of the plenary speakers at that event,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.960]   and we're looking forward to being ministered to by the speakers at that conference. So
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.720]   just a joy to be part of what God is doing around the nation in biblical counseling
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.240]   ministry, and thankful for your part in this training. Tonight we have a wonderful subject.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.000]   We're looking at the subject of past, present, and future sanctification, which is theology exam
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   number 19, and I trust this study will be a very practical one for all of us to apply to our own
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   lives first and foremost, and then use in counseling ministry as we minister to those who are
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.120]   dealing with the issues of life. So we're marching right along in our study, and tonight we're
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.040]   looking at the doctrine of sanctification. Let me pray for us, and let's ask for the Lord's blessing
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   on our study together. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come to you as your children,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.680]   and we just thank you for the joy of being able to come with confidence and with boldness into
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.440]   your presence. Thank you for the work of Christ, which is sufficient to pay for all of our sins,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.320]   and thank you, Lord, that in Christ and because of Christ, we are accepted and beloved because
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   of the work that he has done on our behalf. We thank you that you have given us not only the
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.160]   work of your Son, but we thank you that you have given to us the ministry of your Holy Spirit, who
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.480]   sanctifies us and makes us more into the likeness of Christ, and we pray that the Spirit
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   would do a good work in our hearts and our lives today as we open your Word and as we study its
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.840]   truths. Help us to become more like Christ. We're reminded of the words of the old saint who said
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.120]   that the greatest need of my people is my own personal holiness. Father, truly this is
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.720]   the greatest need of those whom we minister to. It's our own personal sanctification, our own walk
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.440]   with you. We pray that, Father, you would help us to become more holy and that we would be
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   sanctified instruments that you may use for your glory and for your purposes. So help us to
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.480]   understand this doctrine. Help us to apply it to our own lives first and then to the lives of others,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.120]   and we give this time to you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Okay, we're going to dive right into
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.840]   our study for tonight. We are looking at theology exam number 19, past, present, and future
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.920]   sanctification. So I'll go ahead and read the question. The question on the exam is to explain
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   the biblical categories of past, present, and future sanctification. Just to put this question
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.560]   in its context, you'll remember that a few weeks ago we studied the great doctrine of justification,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   the blessing of justification which concerns the grace of imputed righteousness.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   This is the doctrine which deals with our positional righteousness before God
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   in justification. As you remember, there is a double imputation. All of our sins
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.240]   are reckoned to Christ at the cross. God treats Jesus as if he has sinned every single one of our
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.120]   sins, although Jesus Christ lived a perfect life. And then the double imputation is that God then
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.680]   takes all of Christ's righteousness, this perfect spotless record of human righteousness and
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.240]   obedience to the holy law of God, and God reckons it or imputes it to our account by grace alone
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.000]   through faith alone. So that at the moment of conversion, when any sinner believes in Christ,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   the full record of Christ's righteousness is imputed or reckoned to that sinner at the moment
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.720]   of conversion. The justification, as you'll remember from that study, is a point in time
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:01.920]   declaration. It is a legal or forensic declaration in which God declares the sinner to be righteous
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.200]   in Christ. So the full record of Christ's righteousness is granted to us at the moment
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   that we believe in Christ. Now, that's a brief review of what we looked at a few weeks ago under
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.480]   the doctrine of justification, but you'll remember in that study I said to you that a proper
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:32.320]   understanding of justification will lead to a biblical understanding of sanctification.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.840]   If you truly understand the doctrine of justification and the full imputed righteousness
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.360]   of Christ that has been granted to us at the moment of our conversion, it will lead you
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:57.920]   to desire to live a holy life. No one who is truly justified before the holy law of God
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.600]   then turns around and says, "Well, I want to go ahead and sin all that I want. I want to live
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   a prodigal life. I want to live in disobedience to God's word." That is not the fruits of true
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:22.480]   conversion. Anyone who is truly justified before the holy law of God, who has received this
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:31.040]   amazing grace of this point in time declaration, then desires to live a holy life.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:41.200]   And so a right understanding of justification leads to a desire for sanctification.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:52.160]   So these two graces go together. Anyone who is truly justified desires to be sanctified.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.680]   You'll remember from that study a few weeks ago that I said to you we must take pains to
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.000]   distinguish between the grace of justification and the grace of sanctification. We must always
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.880]   hold them to be distinct, but we must always take pains to hold them together, that no one receives
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:26.160]   justification without also desiring sanctification. And so all of that is a introduction and a segue
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:37.040]   into our study tonight. Having received the grace of justification, we now desire to be sanctified.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.680]   And so we're making a transition here from positional righteousness to practical righteousness.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   We are making a transition from the point in time declaration of God at the moment of our
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:01.040]   conversion to the practical aspects of the Christian life. How do we actually grow and
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:08.960]   change? How do we actually become more holy? How do we actually become more like Christ?
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.000]   In justification, God saves us from the penalty of sin. In sanctification,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.920]   we see the fruit of how God has saved us from the power of sin.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.200]   Now, as we're going to see in this essay, the term sanctification is usually used
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.720]   to describe our present pursuit of holiness in our daily lives. Now, if you look at that
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:48.000]   question, the question is explain the biblical categories of past, present, and future sanctification.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.960]   Just to kind of coach you on this essay question, when we usually use the term sanctification,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.920]   we're usually talking about that middle aspect, the present aspect of sanctification. When
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   I usually in conversation talk to people in the church and say, "I'm dealing with issues
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.640]   of sanctification," or if someone says to me, "I'm dealing with an aspect of sanctification,"
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.640]   we're usually in our common language referring to the present aspects of sanctification.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:30.960]   That's how the term usually is used. It's used to describe the Christian life. It's used to describe
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:39.440]   daily Christian living. It's used to describe how we're actually seeking to be more kind,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   be more forgiving, be more gracious, be less angry, be less anxious. It's usually just
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.280]   used to describe our continual growth in Christlikeness. When we usually use the term
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:03.120]   sanctification, we're referring to the present aspect of sanctification. So, you might be saying,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:10.320]   "Well, why does the question ask us to explain the biblical categories of past, present, and future
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.760]   sanctification?" And the answer is the essay question is asking you to stretch a little bit
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:28.560]   to see the present aspect of sanctification in its context. So, they're not gonna let us get away
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.840]   with kind of being comfortable and just referring to the usage of the term that we're familiar with
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.480]   because we're familiar with using sanctification in reference to present daily growth in Christ,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.520]   present daily growth in Christlikeness. What this essay is really asking you to do is to zoom out
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.480]   and to get a broader picture of sanctification and discuss the biblical categories of past
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:08.880]   sanctification, present sanctification, and future sanctification. And we'll see how all of this
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:17.040]   fits together. But just a general approach to this would be one paragraph per aspect of
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:24.880]   sanctification would be a good approach to writing this essay. If you did perhaps an introductory
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:32.000]   paragraph dealing with just sanctification in general, the term sanctification and the meaning
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.640]   of sanctification, that would be a good introduction. And then if you follow that
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.680]   first paragraph with one paragraph dealing with past sanctification, one paragraph dealing with
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.520]   present sanctification, and then one paragraph dealing with future sanctification, that would
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   be a four-paragraph essay. That would be enough to get you to a page and a half, I'm sure.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.400]   And so, that's just a very simple breakdown of one way of writing this essay.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   But what are the three categories of sanctification?
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:17.200]   We'll do a little more detailed work on this, but just an overview that sanctification has a past
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:27.600]   aspect. The Bible uses the terms "sanctification" or "sanctified" in the past tense. We have been
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.240]   sanctified. And we'll look at some scriptures as we go along. So, there is a past aspect to
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:43.680]   sanctification. Theologians refer to this as definitive or positional sanctification. This is
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:52.720]   the sanctification that we have already received. We have been sanctified. We have received
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:02.880]   sanctification. And so, that is referring to the decisive break between the believer and the power
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:11.280]   of sin that has occurred at the moment of our conversion. So, there is a past aspect to
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   sanctification. But you'll see the second usage is the one we're familiar with. It's the present
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:27.280]   aspect of sanctification. This is our daily fight against sin. This is our daily progress in Christ
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:36.400]   likeness. Paul said, "I leave what lies behind. I press forward to what lies ahead. I'm daily
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:45.120]   seeking to know Christ. I'm daily seeking to be more like Christ." There are the present aspects
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:52.960]   of pursuing sanctification. So, the Bible not only describes sanctification in the past tense. We have
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   been sanctified. But the Bible refers to sanctification in the present tense, that we are
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:10.480]   to pursue sanctification in the Lord. And so, theologians refer to this as progressive sanctification,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   or we might refer to this as practical sanctification. And then we have the third
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   aspect, which is the future aspect of sanctification, which is also known as ultimate or perfective
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:37.760]   sanctification. So, the Bible says we have been sanctified. The Bible says we are to pursue
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:47.280]   sanctification. And then the Bible says we will be sanctified. And so, there is a future aspect of
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:58.080]   sanctification. We live in, as I mentioned, in that second category, the present aspect. We live in the
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:07.200]   aspect of progressive sanctification. And just for a moment, I want to make a note as to why
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   the present aspect of sanctification is so important. Just a word here. The ACBC essays,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:26.960]   Theology Exam #19 and Theology Exam #20, both deal with the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.280]   So, this is how important this doctrine is to the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.960]   ACBC wants you to write at least two essays on the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:47.920]   We could make an argument that Theology Exam #21, which deals with the role of the Holy Spirit
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.120]   in the Christian life, we could make an argument that that essay also deals with the subject of
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:04.240]   sanctification for it is the Holy Spirit's ministry to make us more holy. So, all of that to say that
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:13.120]   at least two essays, possibly three essays, are devoted to the subject of sanctification.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:20.160]   That is how important this doctrine is to the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:29.120]   ACBC wants you to thoroughly understand this doctrine and be able to apply it to
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:37.840]   the issues that a counselee faces. And the question would be, why is this doctrine so
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:46.080]   important for the ministry of biblical counseling? Why is it so important that biblical counselors
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:54.160]   understand the doctrine of sanctification? We might ask the question,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   what are we actually trying to do with people when we counsel them?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.840]   So, when someone comes for counseling and sits down with me, and when we talk about life's
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:15.120]   problems, and when we open a discussion, what am I actually trying to do with this person? What is
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:26.720]   the end goal of my meeting with this person? And we laid the foundation in year one of our basic
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.680]   training course that the goal of meeting with a counselee is not merely to help that person feel
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:40.080]   better about life, even though I'll make a statement that I do hope that a person feels
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:47.360]   better after they meet with me or any one of our biblical counselors. That is not the main goal
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:55.280]   of our counseling ministry. It's not merely to allow the counselee to vent or to express
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   emotions or to get something off their chest. You'll see many counseling models actually have
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:10.320]   this as a stated goal of their counseling practice. They want to help the counselee to merely vent
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.200]   or to release emotion or to let something off their chest, and I'm not doubting that there's
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:25.840]   an aspect of that to counseling ministry, but that is not the stated goal of a biblical counselor.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:34.960]   What are we trying to do with people in counseling ministry? And the simple answer is we want our
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:43.840]   counselees to be more sanctified. We want to help them to grow to be more like Christ.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:53.200]   If I've met with a counselee for a number of weeks and I've allowed the counselee to release a large
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.520]   amount of negative emotion or negative thoughts, but I've never led them to the scriptures and
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.440]   helped them through a process where they can actually grow in holiness and grow to be more
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   like Christ, then I really have not fulfilled my purpose as a biblical counselor. My stated aim
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:23.440]   in counseling ministry is to help a counselee to become more like Christ. I pray and I converse
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   and I open the scriptures and I listen well because I want to help the counselee to be
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   more sanctified. Because that is the stated goal of counseling ministry, it is crucial that we have
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:48.800]   a biblical understanding of sanctification, and that's just an overview of why ACBC is asking
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.600]   you to write two to three essays on the doctrine of sanctification. Let me just encourage you to
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:07.760]   do some really good work here. Dig deep and study well and read thoroughly. Just get as much
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.040]   knowledge and biblical understanding of the doctrine of sanctification as you can possibly
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:22.800]   accomplish. Make it a lifelong pursuit to study the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:32.400]   Read good works on this subject. Be alert to aberrant or inaccurate teachings that would hold
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.360]   a false understanding of sanctification. Those are always coming around, by the way.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.920]   Aberrant teachings on the doctrine of sanctification are always coming around
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.360]   in the church, and there's always some form of teaching that says you don't really need to be
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   sanctified, you don't really need to pursue sanctification, or you've somehow reached some
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:04.160]   level of sanctification after 20 or 25 years of becoming a Christian that you don't actually
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:12.080]   need to continue to pursue sanctification. There's always these false doctrines, these false
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.920]   teachings that come around and infect the church that hold forth a wrong doctrine of sanctification,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   and so you want to make it your life's ambition to study this doctrine, to know it well,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:34.800]   to know how it applies to life, and to know practically how to use it in counseling ministry.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.880]   So, I just want to encourage you along those lines. Now, on your handout there,
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.720]   I've listed some resources that will help you think through this doctrine.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:51.200]   Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology has a good section on the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.480]   Heath Lambert's Theology of Biblical Counseling also has a good section on sanctification.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   I would highly recommend to you Anthony Hokema's book Saved by Grace. Get your hands on that book.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:17.600]   It's well worth the price of admission, and the chapter on sanctification is worth the price of
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   the entire book. It's just an excellent chapter that does a great job of especially distinguishing
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:37.120]   the aspect of past sanctification and the aspect of present sanctification. Hokema does a great job
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.720]   dealing with the aspect of definitive or positional sanctification, and then contrasting
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:53.680]   that with the believer's pursuit of progressive sanctification. And he shows how you can't pursue
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:00.960]   present-day sanctification without understanding definitive or positional sanctification. So,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:08.000]   I would highly recommend that book to you and ask you to get your hands on Saved by Grace.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.600]   And then, two journal articles that I've sent to you via the Dropbox. The first is Dr. Mayhew's
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.800]   article, "Sanctification, the Biblical Basics," in the Master's Seminary Journal. That has an
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:30.720]   excellent overview of the doctrine of sanctification. And then, Dr. Barak's article entitled,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.440]   "Sanctification, the Work of the Holy Spirit and Scripture," is a very good treatment of
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   how progressive sanctification takes place. Mayhew's article deals more with the overview
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:51.360]   of past, present, and future sanctification. Dr. Barak's work zeroes in on that second
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:58.560]   present aspect, progressive sanctification, and shows how progressive sanctification is a work
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:06.000]   of the Holy Spirit and Scripture. And I think you would be greatly encouraged if you read that
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.960]   article, and it is a good treatment of present-day sanctification.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:20.880]   So, just some good resources there to help you think through this topic. Now, going back to
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:27.120]   the question, the question is, "Explain the biblical categories of past, present, and future
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:34.000]   sanctification." Let me move to the next page of your handout, and let's do an overview of this
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.040]   great subject. I have a simple statement at the top of your handout there, and that is,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.760]   "As believers, we are called to pursue sanctification. This pursuit is continuous,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:56.080]   and it is lifelong. We never arrive at a level of sanctification where we no longer need to pursue
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:05.920]   greater growth in our spiritual lives, and we can define sanctification as simply the process
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:15.440]   of becoming more holy. Sanctification is the process of becoming more holy. The term
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:23.040]   "sanctification" is derived from the Latin term "sanctus," meaning "holy," and "ficari," meaning
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:33.200]   "to make," and so the term simply means "to make holy." The Greek term "hagios" is translated by
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   the English word "holy," and that word is used 230 times in the New Testament. "Hagios" is the
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:50.960]   foundational root word for "hagiosune," meaning "holiness," "hagiosmos," meaning "sanctification,"
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:27:00.160]   "hagiazo," meaning "to make holy" or "to sanctify," and it is also the foundational root word for
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:11.840]   "hagios," meaning "saint." All of those words have a foundational idea of being set apart or being
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:21.600]   made holy. The aspect of being set apart is really key to understanding the term "to make holy."
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   To be holy is to be set apart for God's purposes. It's to be set apart from sin. It's to be set
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:39.040]   apart from the world, and it is the idea of being consecrated or set apart unto the purposes of God,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:46.320]   and so it does include the moral aspect of being set apart from impurity and being set apart from
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   sin, but it has a broader aspect as well of being consecrated, of being devoted to the purposes
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:06.960]   of God, and all of that underlies the ideas of holiness, sanctification, and to be sanctified.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.480]   You have these terms used throughout the New Testament Scriptures. For example,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:20.960]   Jesus prayed to the Father in John 17, verse 17, "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth."
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:29.280]   Who is Jesus praying for? He's praying for all those who would believe in His name. He's praying
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   for believers. He's praying not only for the disciples in the upper room that night, but all
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.560]   those who would believe in Christ through the disciples' ministry in the future, and He is
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:48.000]   praying that those believers would be made holy, that they would be set apart, that they would be
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.200]   separated from the world and separated from sin and consecrated to the holy things of God. He says,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:09.680]   "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." So, Jesus dies on the cross. He rises from the
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.880]   grave. He gives to His disciples the Great Commission. He ascends to the right hand of the
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:25.120]   Father. The disciples go out, and they proclaim the Word of God, and sinners believe in Christ
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:34.960]   through the proclaimed Word. They become believers. And what happens as a result of all these people
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:41.840]   coming to faith in Jesus Christ? Well, the church is born, and the church continues the work of the
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:50.640]   Great Commission in proclaiming the Word of God and making disciples. And you have at the end of
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   Paul's apostolic ministry, local churches that have been birthed and formed in the Gentile
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.840]   regions, as the gospel goes from Jerusalem to Judea to Samaria to the ends of the earth to the
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:12.880]   Gentile world. And so, very interestingly, you have an example of the church at Corinth,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:20.160]   and the Apostle Paul writes the epistle of 1 Corinthians, and how does he address
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.600]   the church at Corinth, those who have believed in Christ? Now, draw the connection
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:33.600]   between Christ's prayer in the upper room, where he prayed for all those who would come to faith
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.400]   through the disciples' ministry. Draw that connection to the statement of Paul in 1 Corinthians
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:49.280]   chapter 1, verse 2. Paul says, "To the church of God that is in Corinth," and watch this, he says,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:59.040]   "to those who," past tense, "sanctified in Christ Jesus," and then notice the noun form, "who are
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:06.160]   called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours." So, you see there that the church has been sanctified,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:22.880]   past tense, definitive sanctification, and therefore the church has the identity
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:34.320]   of being saints, noun form, present tense, reality. So, sainthood is not this upper level
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:41.120]   of spirituality that is gained through certain good works. Every believer, Paul says, is a saint
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:51.520]   of God. Every believer has been sanctified and therefore is a saint. Now, let me ask you this
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:59.200]   question. Did the church at Corinth struggle with their present-day sanctification? Did they have
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:07.600]   present-day sanctification issues? If you read the book of 1 Corinthians, you realize that they had
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.920]   a lot of problems with their present-day sanctification. They had immorality and lawsuits
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:20.960]   and divisions in the church. They had doctrinal confusion. They had this unhealthy elevation of
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:28.560]   certain spiritual leaders. They had all sorts of present-day sanctification issues in the church.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:36.240]   Paul could have said as he opened the book, "Hey, you guys, you guys need to be more sanctified."
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.920]   But he opens the book by drawing their attention to their past sanctification,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.640]   their definitive sanctification, which informs their identity as being saints.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:57.040]   Now, I'm going to try to keep my comments short on this because we need to move on,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.480]   but I do want to say that this has tremendous implications for counseling ministry.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:10.400]   When you are counseling someone who is struggling with sin, and most of our counselees are
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.040]   struggling with sin, most people don't come to us for counseling saying, "Actually, my sanctification
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.240]   is just going too great. It's going too wonderfully. I'm not struggling at all with
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.440]   sin in my life, and that's why I need counseling." I mean, that may happen every once in a while,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.120]   but generally speaking, people come for counseling because they're struggling with sin.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:40.160]   And so when you are counseling someone who is struggling with sin, and you have come to a place
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:47.520]   where you have assurance that this person is a believer, this is a believer who is weighed down
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:54.720]   with temptation or is weighed down with sin, your temptation as a counselor may be to scold that
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.120]   believer or to kind of berate that believer or to say, "Get serious about your Christian life," or
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   to just shame that believer into being more sanctified. And I will tell you from 1 Corinthians
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.640]   chapter 1 verse 2 that if you do that, you are not following the pattern of the Apostle Paul,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:26.800]   because Paul's approach was first to affirm the fact that this believer has received past-tense
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:36.000]   sanctification, affirm the fact that this person's identity is present-tense a saint of God,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:45.600]   and then on that basis, then exhort that believer to present-day sanctification.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:51.520]   What does that mean? It means that when I'm sitting with Bill in a counseling session,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:58.160]   and Bill is struggling with an anger problem, and Bill is seeking to become more holy, my temptation
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:06.880]   may be just to kind of shame Bill into getting serious about this sin. But instead, I need to
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.240]   go back to the apostolic pattern. I just say, "Bill, based on your profession of faith in Jesus
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.880]   Christ, I just want to affirm, first of all, that you are a saint of God, and that sin has no
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:27.040]   dominion over you. You are not a slave to sin because of the grace you have received in Jesus
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.640]   Christ, and I have confidence, Bill, that if you are humble and you come under the Word of God,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:38.080]   I have confidence. I have every reason to believe that you can grow, and you can become more
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:45.760]   sanctified, because you are a saint of God, and that is the tone and the approach I want to bring
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   in the counseling ministry. In fact, Bill, could I go so far as to call you Saint Bill?
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.640]   I know that might be kind of a weird thing to receive, but I have the right to call you that
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   based upon what the teaching of God's Word says, and I'm going to call you to sanctification
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:16.000]   because you are a saint. That's just a different approach than shame and guilt and just kind of
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:24.880]   berating a counselee into getting serious about the Christian life. I need to move on. You see
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:31.840]   there in 2 Corinthians 7 verse 1, the same term, "Since we have these promises, beloved, let us
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.680]   cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.200]   the fear of God." And 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 3 says, "For this is the will of God, your
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.440]   sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality. For God has not called us for
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:58.320]   impurity, but in holiness." Dr. Berrick writes this, "A proper view of the saint's sanctification
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.920]   must include an accurate understanding of the holiness of God. His holiness is the foundation
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:10.880]   of believers' holiness. Once the student of Scripture has identified the concept of holiness,
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.360]   he can develop the meaning of sanctification by applying the biblical concept of holiness
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:23.920]   to sanctification. Sanctification is the process of making holy." 1 Peter 1 verse 14 says, "As
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.400]   obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance. But as he who
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:37.200]   has called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct. Since it is written, 'You shall be
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:48.880]   holy, for I am holy.'" Just a note there that if God's holiness is the foundation for the believers'
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:57.360]   pursuit of holiness, then what we are saying is that sanctification is the process of becoming
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:06.720]   more conformed to what is infinitely beautiful. Just a word of encouragement. I won't have
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:16.880]   time to develop all of this, but sanctification is beautiful. Psalm 96 verse 9, "Worship the Lord
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.200]   in the splendor of holiness." The King James Version has, "Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:32.800]   of holiness." Dane Ortlund has said, "To become a Christian is to become alive to beauty."
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.560]   John Piper writes, "What is this beauty of holiness in God? It is the infinite worth of
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.720]   his transcendent, Trinitarian fullness, along with the perfect harmony between that worth and
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:52.960]   all his feeling and thinking and acting. The beauty of God's holiness is this perfect harmony
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.280]   between all that God does and the infinite value of all that God is." God is beautiful.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:09.680]   And so as a believer grows in sanctification, we are witnessing the beautiful work of God
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:20.560]   in that believer's life. That is why I am excited about counseling ministry is I get a front row
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:29.360]   view as to seeing God do a beautiful work in a counselee's life as that believer becomes more
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:38.800]   holy. So with that said, let's move to the next page of your handout and just get a view of
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:46.720]   past, present, and future sanctification. And we'll look at the three ways that
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.120]   the word "sanctify" and "sanctification" are used in the New Testament. And we'll begin
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:04.640]   with the past tense. We have been sanctified. We have been sanctified. This is a past act,
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.720]   as I mentioned, that leads to a present day reality. We notice 1 Corinthians 1 verse 2,
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:19.040]   the church at Corinth was sanctified in Christ Jesus. You have 1 Corinthians 1 verse 30 referring
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:25.680]   to a past completed act. And because of him, you are in Christ Jesus who became to us wisdom from
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:34.400]   God, righteousness, and sanctification and redemption. 1 Corinthians 6 verse 11, Paul says,
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:41.600]   "And such were some of you." Note the description here of completed action. Paul says, "You were
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:48.800]   washed. You were sanctified. You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:57.600]   spirit of our God." And then in Acts chapter 20 verse 32, Paul says to the elders at Ephesus,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:05.040]   "And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified." Towards the bottom of your handout
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:23.440]   there, W.E. Vine writes that every believer is sanctified in Christ Jesus. A common New Testament
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:34.480]   designation of all believers is saints, hagioi, sanctified, or holy ones. The sainthood or
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:43.520]   sanctification is not an attainment. It is the state into which God in grace calls sinful men.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:54.080]   And in which they begin their course as Christians. In other words, because you are a saint,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:03.440]   you ought to live pursuing sanctification. John Murray says this, "It is a fact to
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.920]   frequently overlook that in the New Testament, the most characteristic terms
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:16.720]   that refer to sanctification are used," watch this, very important, "they are used not of a process,
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:26.240]   but of a once for all definitive act." What exactly does that mean? Murray continues,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:35.600]   "This means that there is a decisive and definitive breach with the power and service of sin.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.240]   In the case of everyone who has come under the control of the provisions of grace,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:50.240]   as we cannot allow for any reversal or repetition of the resurrection of Christ,
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:57.200]   so we cannot allow for any compromise on the doctrine that every believer is a new man,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:05.120]   that the old man has been crucified, that the body of sin has been destroyed, and that as a new man
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.600]   in Christ Jesus, he serves God in the newness, which is none other than that of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:18.960]   of whom he has become the habitation and his body, the temple." I love that statement.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:26.400]   Past tense, sanctification. We have been sanctified. What does that mean?
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   There's been a decisive and definitive break of the power of sin over the believer's life.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:43.840]   We no longer are slaves to sin because we have received sanctification. And what Murray is saying
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:52.800]   is that this past tense aspect of sanctification does not receive as much press as it ought to
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:00.480]   in the modern day church. We tend to move straight into issues dealing with present day
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:08.080]   sanctification or present tense progressive sanctification, and we don't give enough
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:15.840]   thought and consideration to definitive or positional sanctification to the aspect of
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:26.000]   sin no longer has dominion over me, for I have received sanctification in Christ.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.440]   Anthony Hokema says this, "We conclude that definitive sanctification means not only a
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:41.520]   decisive break with the enslaving power of sin, but also a decisive and irreversible
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.840]   union with Christ in his resurrection, a union by means of which the believer
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:57.120]   is enabled to live in newness of life." What an incredible statement. Theology exam number 19
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:04.000]   is tied together with theology exam number 18, the doctrine of union with Christ. You ask the
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:12.560]   question, how is it that we as believers have been sanctified? How is it that this decisive and
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.400]   irreversible break has occurred between the power of sin and the believer's life?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:27.760]   It is by virtue of the fact that the believer has been raised with Christ. We have been so united
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:34.800]   with Christ in his life, death, and resurrection that when Christ died, we died. When he rose,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:43.760]   we rose. And because he has risen to newness of life, the power of sin has been broken over
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:50.880]   the believer, and we have received sanctification. Now, friends and counselors in training,
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:57.440]   can I say to you that that is good news that you need to use in counseling ministry.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:04.000]   You need to use this truth. You need to sit with a believer who's discouraged,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.400]   who's tempted, who is weak in faith, who is just saying, "I've been struggling with a sin all my
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.480]   life, and I can't grow, and I'll never make progress." And you need to use this truth to help
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.880]   that believer have hope for their own sanctification. You need to use this truth
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:30.080]   with a married couple who's just so embroiled in conflict, so embroiled with arguments that
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:36.240]   they just don't know their way out. And there may be anger issues there, or communication problems
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.760]   there. You need to bring hope to that believer, to those believers who are in that marriage,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:49.600]   and just saying that you are saints, that you have received sanctification, and therefore,
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:59.120]   on that basis, you can pursue sanctification in the Lord. So let me move to the next page
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:09.760]   to present day sanctification. Present day sanctification. Past tense, we have been sanctified.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:17.200]   So present tense, we are being sanctified. This is what theologians refer to as progressive
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:26.960]   sanctification. We have received not only the grace of no longer living under the power of sin,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:34.240]   but we have received imperatives, commands of scripture, exhortations, which call us to pursue
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:41.680]   sanctification. Romans 6 verse 19, Paul says, "So now present your members as slaves to righteousness,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:48.240]   leading to sanctification." Verse 22, "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:55.520]   slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life."
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.800]   So notice this, friends, very carefully. Paul does not say
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:08.640]   you have been sanctified and you have received sanctification, past tense.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:16.720]   Therefore, you can kind of coast your way to become more holy. You can kind of just let go,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.520]   let God. You can kind of just relax and you don't need to read your Bible. You don't need to go to
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.720]   church. You don't need to take the Lord's table. You don't need to fellowship with anyone. It's
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:33.360]   all been done in the past. So just relax and coast your way to sanctification. Notice that that is
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:42.000]   not Paul's language in the book of Romans or in any of his epistles. What Paul does is he affirms
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:50.400]   past tense sanctification and then he calls the believer to pursue sanctification
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:59.280]   through the use and through the devotion to the means of grace. So I have no problem sitting with
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.720]   Bill in a counseling session and saying, "Bill, you are a saint of God. Bill, you have been
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   sanctified. Bill, you no longer live under the power of sin. And therefore, Bill, I want you to
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:22.480]   read the Bible every day this week. Therefore, Bill, I want you to go to church every Sunday
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.320]   that we meet. As long as we are meeting in counseling sessions, I want you to go to church
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:36.480]   every Sunday. Therefore, Bill, I want you to go to a small group and I want you to pray for three
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.120]   people this week. Your identity as a saint does not mean you can relax and coast your way to
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:50.640]   sanctification. Your identity as a saint fuels and is the foundation for present-day obedience
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:59.040]   to the commands of God." And so this is the tenor and the perspective Paul brings to
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:07.440]   our sanctification. It's a good battle. It's a good fight. You see there in
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   Hebrews 10, verse 14, the writer of Hebrews says, "For by a single offering, he has perfected for
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.400]   all time those who are present-tense being sanctified." Millard Erickson writes this,
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:29.200]   "The Holy Spirit works sanctification in the life of the believer. By sanctification is meant the
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:36.960]   continued transformation of moral and spiritual character so that the life of the believer
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:43.120]   actually comes to mirror the standing which he or she already has in God's sight.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.640]   While justification is an instantaneous act, giving the individual a righteous standing before
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:58.480]   God, sanctification is a process making the person holy or good. The work," I love this,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:05.520]   underline and circle this. This is so good. "The work of the Holy Spirit in sanctification then
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:14.960]   is not merely the negative work of mortification, but also the production of a positive likeness
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:21.920]   to Christ." I believe many times we think sanctification more in terms of the negative
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:29.760]   aspect of not sinning, not being angry, not being lazy, not being anxious, and not in terms of the
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:37.360]   positive aspects of what God is doing in our lives. He's making us to look more like Christ.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:44.960]   So a number of verses there. I'm going to move on to the next page and just hit a couple points.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:51.760]   I believe this is on page five of your handout. Just a couple bullet points there that you want
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:58.320]   to think through. Read Dr. Barak's work on sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:05.920]   and the Word, but just noting there that sanctification is ultimately a work of the
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:14.720]   Holy Spirit. It does involve our responsible participation, but I'm so glad that this is true,
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:23.360]   that ultimately sanctification is not based upon my effort or my resources, but it is the work of
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   the Holy Spirit in conforming the believer to Christ, and therefore I have hope that the Holy
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:42.160]   Spirit can and will sanctify me. A number of verses there that you can look at, but just again,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:48.480]   use this in counseling ministry. Use this to encourage counselees. Bill, by the power of the
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:56.800]   Spirit, I know that you can grow in this area of your life. By the power of the Spirit, I know that
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.320]   God will use our counseling sessions to do a good work in your life. That's what we as biblical
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.240]   counselors offer that no other counseling perspective or methodology offers. We offer
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:16.240]   the power in the ministry of the Spirit, and then you note there that the means of the Spirit
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.360]   is the Word of God. The Holy Spirit works through the Scripture. The Holy Spirit never works apart
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:30.560]   from the Scripture. The Holy Spirit uses the Word of God to convict us, change us, mold us,
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.000]   and make us more into the likeness of Jesus Christ. This is why we ought to pray every
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   time we sit under the teaching of God's Word, every time we go to church and hear the Word
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.400]   of God proclaimed, "Lord, use your Word, and by the power of the Spirit, may my heart be
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:57.280]   convicted and changed so that I would become more like Jesus Christ." The Word of God is called
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:09.840]   the sword of the Spirit. Why are people struggling in their Christian lives? Very simply, we notice
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:19.040]   in many cases in our counseling ministry that the common denominator here is that people are simply
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:26.080]   not in the Word of God. You'll find this as you engage more in counseling, as you get involved
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:31.200]   in people's lives, you'll find that the reason why they're struggling with sin or feeling overcome
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:37.280]   with sin is because they're simply not in God's Word. They're not reading God's Word on a daily
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:43.120]   basis. They're not hearing God's Word on a Sunday morning. They're just not engaged with the Word
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.880]   of God, and they might have some kind of lip service to the truthfulness of God's Word, but
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:55.520]   they are not personally interacting with the Word of God. Therefore, they're not experiencing the
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:02.080]   power and the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and they are not being sanctified,
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:08.560]   and so we want to help people with that in counseling ministry. Okay, moving to the last
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   page, the future tense of sanctification. We have been sanctified. We are being sanctified.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:24.640]   Then the future tense, we will be sanctified. 1 Thessalonians 5, verse 23, Paul's benediction,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:32.000]   "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely." What a great statement.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.760]   "May your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.880]   Just a word here. This is the desire of every Christian's heart. I mean, this is what we long
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:53.120]   for. The Christian, we used to love our sin as an unbeliever. When we placed our faith in Jesus
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:56:03.040]   Christ, it's not that we never sin again, but it is that we no longer love our sin. We hate our sin,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.960]   and we love righteousness, and we long to grow, and we long to become more holy, and we live in
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:14.400]   this tension of Romans 7. We don't do what we ought to do. We do what we don't want to do.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:21.840]   The flesh wars against the Spirit. The Spirit sets its desire against the flesh, and so we're
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:29.440]   continually battling for sanctification, but the true longing of the believer's heart is for
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:36.560]   holiness, and we long for that day when we will be sanctified completely. When we no longer
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:43.680]   struggle with temptation, we'll no longer struggle with sin, and that is the great hope that is held
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:52.720]   out by Paul in this benediction that the God of peace will himself sanctify the church, and then
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:57:00.320]   there's the beautiful word, completely, completely. One day the church will be presented to Christ,
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:07.600]   as Ephesians 5 says, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, and in all blameless glory,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:16.800]   we will be presented to Christ and dwell with Him forever and ever. 1 John 3, verse 2, "Beloved,
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.960]   we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared, but we know that when He
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:32.400]   appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is." Anthony Hokema writes this,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   "The Bible indicates that the glory of God is the final end of our sanctification. In other words,
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:44.080]   all the amazing blessings of our salvation, including our sanctification, have as their
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:49.760]   final goal the praise of the glory of God. Nothing in all of history will reveal the fullness of
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.280]   God's perfections as brilliantly as will the completed glorification of His people.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.800]   God's purpose for us, in other words, is not just future happiness or a guaranteed entrance into
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:08.400]   heaven, but perfect likeness to Christ and therefore to Himself. God could not, in fact,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:15.040]   have designed a higher destiny for His people than that they should be completely like His only Son
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:23.840]   in whom He delights. Then we shall not only see Him face to face, but shall totally and undividedly
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:31.920]   live to the praise of the glory of His grace, world without end." That's the glorious hope
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:38.400]   of every believer in Christ. One day, we shall perfectly be like Christ.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:46.320]   So, I leave you with the words of Johnny Erickson Tada, who said this,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:56.560]   and these words are so appropriate to year 2020 as they were in the days when she said these words.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:05.680]   She said, "Suffering is the textbook that will teach you who you really are." I was just discussing
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:15.280]   this with a brother this week at church in fellowship after the service. 2020 has been a long
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:23.920]   year, and it is a year that has revealed where we really are spiritually. I mean, it is a year that
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:32.080]   has been designed to sanctify us, but first, it is a year that has contained many various trials
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:40.960]   which have been designed to show us where we really are spiritually. And this echoes what
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:48.560]   Johnny Tada has said. Suffering will teach you who you really are. Suffering is the textbook
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:54.000]   that will show you the stuff of which you are really made. It will sandblast you. It will strip
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.160]   you bare. It will strip you of all your sinful ways, leaving your soul raw and exposed, but also
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:07.440]   that you might be better bonded to the Savior. And then after she talks about the role of suffering
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.840]   in this life and making us more like Christ in our present sanctification, she begins to reflect on
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:20.800]   her future sanctification, what we've called ultimate or perfective sanctification. And she
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:28.000]   says this, "Don't be thinking that when I get to heaven, I'm most looking forward to a new body
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.960]   free from cancer or pain or quadriplegia. Don't be thinking that when I get to be with Jesus,
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.920]   I'm going to relish mostly in jumping up and dancing and kicking and doing aerobics.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:46.560]   What I'm looking forward to mostly is the new heart, the glorified heart that is free from sin,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:54.000]   free from selfishness, free from self-centeredness, free of fear of the future, free of the fear of
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.160]   everything, a heart that no longer feels trapped by circumstances or resists God or looks for an
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.960]   escape or tries to justify itself when it is wrong. That will be glory for me, glory for me,
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.240]   when by his grace I shall look on his face. That will be glory, be glory for me."
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:21.360]   And what she's saying there is that as you're in the battle for present day sanctification,
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.360]   you can never lose sight of our future sanctification. One day we will be completely
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:36.240]   sanctified and live in a world without sin or temptation or worldliness or the pollution
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:45.520]   of this world or of the flesh. We will be completely set apart unto God without spot or
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.000]   wrinkle or any such thing. And we shall worship God in the splendor of holiness forever and ever
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.360]   and days without end. And because we have that great hope, we engage in this battle daily for
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:08.640]   sanctification and holiness in the Lord. I want to encourage you to write a great essay on this
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   topic. I want to encourage you that this is a topic that is worthy of your careful study of
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.360]   a precise language of biblical understanding. And I want to encourage you that this is a doctrine
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:27.120]   that if you study well and you write a good essay on, that you will use in counseling ministry,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.640]   both to counsel your own heart for many years to come, Lord willing, but also to counsel others
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:41.680]   as your counselees deal with the issues of life. And so I just ask for God's blessing on your study
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:49.040]   on this topic. Well, that's all I have for tonight. Thank you so much for joining us on this webinar.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.960]   And thank you for being part of this class. I do want to make an announcement that next Sunday,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:02.560]   we will not be meeting next Sunday. My wife and I are going to be on a vacation next week,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.800]   and we're looking forward to that time with our family. And so we're going to take a one week
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.400]   pause from our weekly meetings. We will resume with theology exam number 20 the following Sunday,
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:23.520]   and look forward to rejoining with that time. But no class next Sunday. We'll see you in two weeks,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.800]   and we trust that you'll have a wonderful time of study. So let me close this in prayer,
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.720]   and we'll be dismissed for tonight. Father, thank you for this great hope,
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.840]   Lord, that we have just discussed, that one day we shall be perfectly like Christ,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:46.560]   that we will be sanctified completely, and that we will worship you in the splendor of holiness,
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:54.080]   forever and ever. Father, we are engaged daily in the battle for sanctification,
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.960]   and I pray that, Lord, we may take heart in that battle, and that we would take the Word of God,
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:06.880]   which is the sword of the Spirit, and that we would immerse our hearts and our minds in your
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:13.040]   truth, and that the Spirit of God, through the Word of God, would do a beautiful work
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.800]   of sanctification in our lives, and conform us to the likeness of Christ. Thank you for
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.400]   each of my brothers and sisters in Christ who have joined us tonight. Bless each one,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.360]   and grant us a fruitful time of study, and we commit this time to you in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.240]   Amen. God bless you. We will see you in two
