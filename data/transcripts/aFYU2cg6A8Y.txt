[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   All right, let's see here, 52.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.380]   Let's do a couple of questions on a deep life
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.120]   before we call it a day here.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.260]   My first one here comes from Brian.
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.780]   Brian asked, "Are podcasts good for you?"
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.720]   So he has a bunch of different points about this,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.460]   but let me point out two in particular.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.880]   The first is, he asked, "What would Marshall McLuhan
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.280]   "or Neil Postman say about a medium
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   "that feels like 100 times the old talk radio format?"
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.000]   So Brian is concerned about the sort of,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.560]   what does it do to your mind, this relationship
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560]   where you have someone in your ears
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.440]   for multiple hours each day?
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.240]   And he looks to McLuhan and Postman,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.440]   who of course have this,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.400]   the medium is the message type analysis of media.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.200]   McLuhan and his protege Postman would argue
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.440]   that the form in which you're consuming media
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840]   actually changes the message
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.100]   and the impact of the message.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.520]   And I think this definitely is at play for podcasting.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.200]   However, and this is very self-serving
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.100]   because I'm telling you this on a podcast right now,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.200]   I think generally the impact of this medium
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.380]   on the message is positive, right?
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.160]   So what do you get, for example, when the medium is tweets?
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.200]   So we're looking at Twitter.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.600]   Well, now it's a very short,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   there's a trying to grab attention
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.320]   and there is a really tight feedback loop
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.600]   of likes and dislikes and retweets
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   and catching the algorithm's attention
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.520]   so that a tweet immediately gives you these clear indicators
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.920]   of it's taking off or not taking off.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340]   Now that's an example of a medium
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.480]   that really changes the message.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.040]   So the type of communication you would get
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.480]   on a platform like Twitter,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   just to use that as an example of McLuhan
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.280]   and Postman's thinking is one that is way more simplified
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.520]   and emotionally charged.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.600]   It is a place where people are trying to dunk on each other.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.400]   It's very tribal and very anxiety inducing.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   So that's an example where the medium changes
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.840]   the form of the message.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.660]   Podcasting, I would say, has an opposite effect.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.200]   It's long form and you can hear the human voice.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.940]   So you get all of the nuances and subtleties
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660]   that is embedded in pacing and tonality
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.120]   in the human voice and it's long form.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.680]   So someone can take their time
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.440]   and explain how they're thinking about something,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.100]   change their mind on how they're thinking
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.720]   about something, think out loud in real time.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.400]   It's much more human, much more humanizing
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.320]   than some of the other big digital communication
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   technologies that have taken off
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.560]   in the last 10 to 20 years.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.920]   And so I actually think what it does
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   is it gives you a more moderating style message.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.440]   And so it is, I believe, if we're looking at digital,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.200]   if we're looking at digital tools or modern media tools,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.860]   I actually think that the podcasting
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.460]   does a pretty good job.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460]   If we're gonna rank these things,
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.620]   I think it does a pretty good job.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.180]   I mean, Twitter creates a dumpster fire.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.860]   TikTok just turns people into essentially
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.700]   algorithmically enhanced cyborgs.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.980]   That algorithm just drives people
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.620]   into really weird places.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.860]   Jacob Orr talks about this in "The Loop,"
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.580]   that book I talked about earlier in the show.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.660]   And he talks about how TikTok,
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.860]   there's some interesting, talented people on there,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.940]   but the people who really take off, it's really weird.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.440]   They're sort of playing with these particular forms
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960]   where you do like lip syncing,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.160]   they're not very good at it,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.000]   and it's just working with the algorithm.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.560]   And so TikTok, that medium makes the message,
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.180]   turns people into cyborgs.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.000]   Twitter turns people into like dumpster fire,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.060]   lighting zombie hordes.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.260]   If you go back and look at Postman's analysis
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.320]   of the old school TV,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.200]   when there used to be three channels,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.400]   his big thing is it simplified everything down
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.080]   to these sort of sound bites.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.760]   Podcasting ranks pretty well.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.200]   I think it ranks pretty well.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.540]   You get this long form, nuanced relationship
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.820]   with a real human being.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.840]   And so, yes, as with anything,
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.820]   if that human being is intent on a particular point of view,
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.440]   then yeah, it can really bring you into that world.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.840]   And talk radio, right-wing talk radio
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.320]   certainly did this at the time.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.640]   It could really bring people into a own-to-libs type
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.360]   mindset over time, and it could, what have you.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.980]   But I still think it is a medium
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.760]   that creates a good type of message.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.080]   It just seems very humanizing.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.520]   It's really hard to listen to a long-form podcast
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.200]   with a lot of people and come off and be like,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.000]   really like, I hate that person, or I hate other people.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.380]   So who knows, maybe I'm being optimistic.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.340]   Obviously it has its flaws,
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.720]   but I'll take it over a lot of the other platforms any day.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.180]   He also asked, Brian also asked if they're more shallow
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.840]   and distracting than say reading books.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.080]   I mean, I think, yes, Brian,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.800]   don't give up a book reading habit for podcasting.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.480]   It is different, it is shallower than a book
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.520]   because a book will typically represent someone
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520]   who has spent multiple years trying to hone and craft
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.040]   and structure their thoughts on a topic.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   So it's just a, from an intellectual consumption experience
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.560]   different than let's say me riffing on the mic.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.940]   But I think podcasting is great
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.400]   for otherwise wasted downtime.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.440]   I'm doing a chore, I'm driving to work.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.280]   Why not?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.040]   I think that's a good time to do it.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.080]   Now, if you do books on tape,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.520]   you maybe want to alternate between these two,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.840]   you should read real books as well.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.460]   So yeah, it shouldn't be the only thing you listen to,
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.960]   but this is not gonna surprise anyone by Impro,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.280]   a Impro podcast.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.780]   (upbeat music)
