[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   We apologise for the poor quality of the following recording of a sermon
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.320]   by the late Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones. Although we have digitally restored this to improve clarity,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.840]   the quality is not as good as we would like. We do apologise for this but nevertheless
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.440]   hope that this sermon will be a great encouragement and a blessing to you.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.120]   to be found in the Gospel according to Saint Luke in the first chapter verses 76 to 79.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.720]   Verses 76 to 79 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Luke.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.120]   And thou, child, thou shalt be called the prophet of the highest,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.000]   for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.000]   to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.200]   through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.720]   into the way of peace. That's worth reading again isn't it?
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.520]   And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the highest,
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.560]   for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.120]   to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.200]   through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.640]   to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.080]   to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   Now these words were uttered by Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.280]   And in them he gives an account beforehand and prophesies what was to be the ministry
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   which was to be exercised by his son. It's a most amazing record as you remember.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.960]   We are told how this man who had ever tried to live a righteous and a good life according to
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   the law, he and his wife, we are told how this man in the temple on that famous occasion was
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   visited by an angel and was told how a son was to be born unto him and told certain things about
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.200]   that son, that he was unable to believe it. It seemed too wonderful, it seemed too good to be
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.520]   true, it seemed impossible. And because of his lack of faith he was struck dumb, you remember,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.720]   and was unable to speak for some considerable time. Then the child was born and his speech
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.360]   returned to him. And one of the first things he did was to sing this great hymn of praise
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   and of thanksgiving which is recorded in this first chapter of Luke, beginning at verse 68
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.320]   and going on to this 79th verse. Now I say that looked at from any standpoint this is really
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.400]   remarkable and astonishing. You notice this old man bursts forth into praise and into thanksgiving.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.840]   He realizes what is happening. He realizes what God is doing. And he realizes something of the
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   part that his own son is to bear in all this, though he is but a child at this point. And here
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.680]   I say he gives us this description and this account. His son, known as John the Baptist,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.120]   was to be the great fire runner of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior, the Deliverer.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.040]   He was one who was to go before him to prepare the way for him. It was the custom to send runners
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.880]   and others to prepare the way for a great king when he was traveling from one place to another.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   And that's the image, that's the picture that's used. John was the one, like a voice crying in
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.040]   the wilderness, preparing the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. Every valley shall be
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.120]   exalted and every mountain and hill shall be brought low. That was his purpose. The preparer,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.240]   the forerunner, the announcer, the proclaimer of the great one who is to come. But not only that,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   he also has it as a part of his ministry to describe what the Lord is going to do,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.200]   the purpose of his coming, and the result of his coming. And that is what we have here.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.160]   In other words, it's a very perfect summary of the gospel. Again, I would note this, that there
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.120]   is nothing which is so astonishing as the way thus in just this small compass you really can
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.000]   be given the essential message of the Christian gospel of salvation in just a few words.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.800]   And it's uttered here by these people before the very birth of the Son of God. It was all
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.760]   given to them, they were given to see it by the Holy Spirit. We are told that Zacharias
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.680]   was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying. And what he said was, first of all,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:46.080]   "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people." He praises God.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.280]   Now, it is the obvious and simple truth, isn't it, to say this,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.880]   that only where, wherever you find any mention of this coming of the Son of God into the world,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.000]   you always get this note of prayers. It's here in the scriptures, it's in the hymns we've been
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   singing, it's right through our hymn books, it's in the great anthems, it's in the oratorias.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.400]   All men who've ever been inspired by the Spirit, when they come to this theme,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.680]   they give this unusual note of praise and of thanksgiving, as they even think
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:35.040]   of what happened when the Son of God came into this world. And therefore,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.800]   we obviously must ask ourselves, every one of us, a question at this moment.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.840]   Do we know something about that joy? Do we understand this praise? Are we taking part in it?
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.920]   Come, let's be quite frank and honest with one another. What does this Christmas season represent
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.600]   to us? What's our reaction to it? How do we look at it? How do we look at these days that are going
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   to come? Is our reaction simply that of the world, or do we regard it but as a family occasion,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.480]   an occasion for family reunions and meeting friends and eating and drinking and enjoying
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.120]   ourselves? Is that it? Not that I'm condemning anything like that, I have no reason to condemn
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:31.520]   it at all, but I'm simply asking, is that all? Or is there something more? As we realize what it
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   stands for and is meant to stand for, do we know something of the thrill of these people?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.720]   Mary, Zacharias, the heavenly hosts, the angels we've been singing about.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:55.440]   Do we get this? Do we feel it? Are we conscious of it? I say that if you go through the literature
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.040]   of the Church from the beginning until now, whether you take it in the hymns or the biographies,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.520]   I don't care how you approach it, you will find that when men and women have realized truly what
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:16.000]   happened on that first Christmas day, it just leads them to a hymn of praise and of thanksgiving
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.760]   they can't contain themselves. Now that obviously, it seems to me, is the world test of our Christian
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:31.920]   profession. I say that in the authority of the Scripture. The Apostle Paul, writing to the
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:39.200]   Philippians, says, "Rejoice in the Lord always." And again I say, rejoice.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.240]   The Christian is meant to be a man full of a spirit of rejoicing.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:54.080]   And Christian people are present at this moment. If we're not like that, we are poor Christians.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.000]   We are almost a living contradiction of our own faith. Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.200]   It doesn't matter what happens. Wherever you are, whatever your circumstances, rejoice in the Lord
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.360]   always. It doesn't just mean be superficially happy and cheerful and buoyant. Not at all.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:25.040]   Rejoice in the Lord always. And again I say, rejoice. And we can be quite certain of this.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:36.320]   To realize who he is and why he came and what he did, our necessity must lead to rejoicing.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:44.400]   So I argue that unless we are filled with this sense of rejoicing as we contemplate these things,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.640]   there is only one adequate explanation of that. And that is that we've never truly realized
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.520]   what it all means. Very well. I think if we analyze this statement of Zacharias' together,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   we shall discover why it is that anybody who sees it truly invariably bursts forth into song
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.920]   and into praise and is filled with a spirit of rejoicing.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.560]   Shall I try to summarize the message for you by putting it under two main headings?
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.720]   The first thing we note here is the state of the world into which Christ came.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.840]   There are always two sides to this. And really you must always hold them together and take them
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:38.880]   together. This joy is always to be measured in this two-fold manner. You measure the depth of
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.400]   the things from which we are delivered, you measure the height to which we are taken.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.720]   And those are the two things, it seems to me, that come out so clearly from this statement
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.600]   of Zacharias about the ministry and the message of his own infant son who became famous as John
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:04.240]   the Baptist. Why is this man so happy? Well, it's because he realizes the state of the world.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.120]   What is that? Well, here it is in verse 79. He says that this day spring from on high
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.200]   hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:25.840]   to guide our feet into the way of peace. Now there, of course, he's using a picture.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:33.280]   And it's generally agreed that the picture which he has in his mind must be something to this effect.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   He's picturing a number of people going on a journey, they're traveling,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:48.560]   they're making for a certain city. They want to arrive at that city, they believe that if they
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.840]   could only reach that city they would derive certain satisfaction. So they've set out upon
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:02.000]   this great trek, this long journey, and they've been traveling. But e'er less the sun has set,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.320]   night has descended upon them. The whole place is covered with a thick darkness.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:15.360]   It's a kind of fog that they can't see. And they come to the conclusion that it would be
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.600]   folly and ridiculous to attempt to go any further. In this darkness by which they're surrounded and
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.440]   which shrouds everything, they say there's only one thing to do, we must sit down.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:33.120]   They sit down in utter hopelessness and despair. They don't know where the city is, they've lost
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.080]   their road, they don't know where they are, they see no track. They simply sit down. But that isn't
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.240]   the end of their troubles. They realize that they're exposed to certain terrible dangers.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:53.120]   They not only sit in darkness, they're in the shadow of death. At any moment they may be attacked
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.600]   and be set upon by wild beasts. They may be attacked by robbers and by thieves. They don't
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.160]   know where they are, they're helpless, they're just sitting in the darkness and at any moment
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:13.920]   they may be overwhelmed and may be put to death. And the result of all this of course is unhappiness,
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:23.360]   wretchedness, anxiety, nervousness, and turmoil. Now that according to the scriptures, and this is
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.640]   just one sample that we are looking at tonight of many that could be abused, that according to the
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:36.880]   scripture, is the condition of the world apart from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.040]   The world in other words, for me to put it in the form of a number of propositions,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.680]   is this. The condition of the world is that it's lost.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:54.240]   The world is in a state of darkness. Now I understand that as meaning something like this,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.960]   that any thinking person is aware that there's something wrong.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.600]   There is a deep discontent in the heart of humanity.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:12.720]   Mankind is ill at ease. It gives him expression to in various ways. But man has got this kind
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.360]   of feeling within him, that things were not meant to be as they are. He's got an idea that there is
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:26.640]   a better world possible. And he sets out to seek for it. He does so in many different ways.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:34.000]   But the whole story of the human race in a sense is the story of mankind setting out upon this great
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   quest. Man's got an idea that there is a city if he could but arrive at it. Where he'd be delimited
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.160]   from his problems and perplexities. Where he'd find a solution to his anxieties, where he would
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   be safe. Now I think you'll all agree with that. This is the meaning of the great intellectual
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.360]   quest amongst others, which has characterized the life and the endeavor of men throughout
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.560]   the running centuries. Man thinks, he's a philosopher, and he sets out in this great
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.880]   quest for truth. He's convinced that somewhere or another there is an answer to all these problems
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.720]   and questions. He's aware that within himself there is something that obviously differentiates
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.920]   him from the animal. "Dust of art, a dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul."
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:33.040]   Man's got an idea that he's imperishable and that he was meant for something bigger,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.720]   an amplifier, a diviner air. And this has created a restlessness within him.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.040]   And he sets out in this quest for the city. He does it with his mind, his intellect,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.480]   his understanding. He believes that if he only knew more he'd solve his problems.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:16:01.040]   We're all familiar with this. This picture of this great trek, this crusade, this procession,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.600]   this seeking, searching for the city, is something of which we're all aware. Oh,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.680]   the Bible's full of it. You get the hundred and seventh psalm putting the thing very perfectly.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   It describes mankind as seeking for a city of habitation in which they may dwell. That's it.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:27.120]   It's exactly the same idea. Others go on this same quest in other ways, in a moral manner,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.640]   and others in a political manner. There are endless subdivisions of the way in which man
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   convinces himself that he really can get out of his perplexity and his problem.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:46.160]   But he never seems to be able to do so. I don't want to keep you with this because it's the
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.960]   negative. But it is a very essential part of the preaching of the gospel to emphasize the negative.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.720]   Now our hymn has just been talking about two thousand long years,
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.800]   and I want to talk about the same two thousand long years. Are we any nearer to the city,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:11.920]   to this marvelous city of habitation which is going to solve the problems of men in the world?
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:19.120]   Are we nearer to it? Would anybody like to say that we are nearer to it than they were in 1914?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:27.040]   Are we nearer to it than men were in 1853? There's been a tremendous increase in knowledge
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.520]   since in so many respects. There's been all the thinking and all the publishing of books and all
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.720]   the multiplication of schools and of education. Would anybody like to say that we are nearer
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.240]   the city? Can you see the city? Can you see the outlines of the city? Can you see that girl for
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.400]   which mankind is striving, after which it is striving? Can you say that you're beginning to
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.160]   see the lights of the city sparkling in the gloom, and that means just a few years before
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.160]   the world will have arrived there? Would you like to say that? Does the world look like that tonight?
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.920]   Does it look as if men, as a result of his efforts and his striving and his endeavor,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.280]   is at last on the verge of solving his problems?
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.600]   It would be a very bold, indeed it would be a very foolish man
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   who would like to say that that is the case. The fact is, my friends, when we are honest and
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:35.920]   admit it, we've got to confess that there is no world in this, no light in this world tonight
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:43.280]   apart from this light that has come in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.120]   Ultimately, and it's a matter that I'm prepared to argue with anybody who likes to contest it at
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.840]   any time or in any place, ultimately I say without Christ the world is hopeless.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   There is no light at all. We simply keep on going round and round in circles.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.680]   Indeed, some of the best philosophers who are not Christians would have us believe that the
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.520]   whole history of mankind is circular. And that's why they're so profoundly pessimistic.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.200]   They say what happens in this world is that you always seem to be climbing up what you
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.920]   think is a level that's going to lead you to heaven or to some kind of paradise,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.400]   but alas, you ever discover that you get to a point when you seem to be coming to a level again
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.600]   and you begin to realize that you're descending on the other side,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.560]   you're not climbing up a ladder that goes perpendicularly straight up, you are simply
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   going up the side of a circle, it leads to the top and you go down the other side.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:56.080]   Look at the histories, they say of the great civilizations. Go and read Professor Toynbee
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.800]   and that's what he'll tell you. It's all a matter of cycles and of circles.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.440]   Think of the great civilization that was once in China and that went.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   Think of the great civilization in Egypt, the amazing, astounding learning that they once
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   had there in almost every respect and how they went down the other side of the circle.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.600]   The same in Persia, the same in Greece, the same in Rome. It's not that perfect.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.760]   Now these men have elaborated a very philosophy which teaches that, that the whole thing is
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.200]   cyclical and circular and that you're constantly being thwarted when you think you're arriving,
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.920]   you seem to get further away, you never go up and really arrive. The world is lost.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:51.120]   Is there anyone who can give us a lead tonight? Do you know of any philosopher,
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:58.080]   of any teacher anywhere who can give you an assured hope? Where is he? There's ample
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.480]   opportunity for him to speak in the wireless or to write in books. They jump at an opportunity
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:09.440]   to let him speak, but where is he? No, no, the fact is that the world as it was when Zacharias
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:17.680]   spoke is in a condition of sitting in darkness. We've sought, we've searched, we've investigated,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.760]   but we don't know. We've lost our way, there seems to be no light at all, and mankind at the moment,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:31.760]   I suggest to you, is becoming cynical. It's sitting down in despair and in a condition of hopelessness.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:39.200]   And that is why there are so many who have carried this thing to its logical conclusion in a sense
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.480]   and are just saying, let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:52.400]   Sitting in darkness. Yes, but as I've said, not only that, according to this description,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.640]   also in the shadow of death, and this I say is the picture in which
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.720]   represented the various dangers that confront people who are in that condition.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.760]   There you are in open country, you haven't got a city wall to defend you, there's no police to
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.040]   guard you, you're just in this open space, just sitting down because there's nothing else to do,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.160]   and at any moment I say you may be attacked by marauding bands and groups of beasts,
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:34.080]   or by gangs of thieves and of robbers. Not only is the world hopeless, the world is in a terrible
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:42.400]   danger. And there are these enemies that are so constantly attacking us. I don't want to give you
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:49.840]   an exhaustive list, let me just mention some of them. The trouble with mankind is not merely that
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.920]   we can't find a way out of all our problems and perplexities, but we are constantly being beset
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.920]   and constantly being attacked. The difficulty in life is this, isn't it, not only that you
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.080]   can't advance, but you can't even stay where you are, you seem to be losing the whole time.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:15.360]   There are those who would even depict life as a kind of Peter Pan existence, which means that
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.040]   we come into this world innocent and perfect. I don't subscribe to their philosophy, I think it's
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.400]   quite wrong, but it's interesting that even they who are not Christians who believe that, are really
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.960]   showing what Zacharias means when he talks about this sitting in the shadow of death. They say
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.800]   that's how we come into the world, and then the world begins to attack us. It robs us of our
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   innocence, it robs us of our purity, it robs us of our chastity, it robs us of our hopefulness,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:57.840]   it turns us into cynics, it robs us of our joy and of our peace, it's always there attacking us,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:06.640]   taking things from us, dragging us down. Oh yes, shades of the prison house begin to close upon
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:15.600]   the growing die, he's lost that rapture of youth, that's their philosophy. Well, I say I don't accept
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   it as an explanation of life, but I've got to agree with the facts. The facts are perfectly right,
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   and it's true of the individual, and it's true of the whole world outside Christ and apart from him.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.480]   Not only do things not get better, they get worse, and we seem to be losing something.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.680]   Ah yes, but it's not only spiritual and moral. There are certain other enemies, aren't there?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.560]   Think of this picture with that group of people seated there in that wilderness,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.640]   can't go on because of the darkness. They wanted to get to the city, they can't,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.600]   and they're afraid that any moment they hear some mysterious noises. Are these animals coming to
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.680]   them? Are they about to devour them? Are the robbers and the thieves coming? And isn't that life?
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.000]   We can't understand the mystery, we can't solve the problem, we're in this darkness, in this fog.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.640]   Yes, and as we sit there in this helplessness, we hear these ominous sounds.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:26.960]   What are they? Well, illness, illness, a stab of pain, an acute trouble,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.040]   something that reminds me of the frailty of my life, the tenuous character of my existence.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:46.000]   Old age, the first signs and indications of the decaying of the tent, the reminder that I've got
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   to go on, do what I will, I can't help it, I hear them coming nearer and nearer, these marauders,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.680]   these attackers, they're coming for me, when will they come? Isn't that it? I was told a thing the
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:08.400]   other day by a lady who told me that she'd been to the prize giving, I think it was, of her old
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.200]   school at Emirate, it was some special celebration in connection with the school, and she told me
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   that she'd met a friend of hers whom she hadn't seen for a number of years, incidentally a friend
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.120]   living here in London, I think she said, in rather a prominent position, and the two friends met,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.200]   and the friend here in London said to this other one to whom I was speaking in the provinces,
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.040]   she said, what's the matter with you, what do you mean, said the friend, she said, you're letting
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.480]   yourself get old, she said, you shouldn't do that, you're foolish, why do you let yourself get old
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.200]   like this? Well, said my friend, it's no use fighting it, is it, I am older, you and I are
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.800]   that much older since we last met. Ah, yes, said this friend here in London who was living this
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.760]   high life so-called, I know where we are but I hate the thing, I hate old age, I hate the fact
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.040]   I'm getting older, I hate the thought of death, and yet I can do nothing about it, I can't stop it,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   that's it. She's lost in life, you see, in this world, and she can hear this thing which to her
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:23.360]   is a beast of prey, a marauder, old age, barking, and coming nearer, and ready to grip her and to
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:30.880]   devour her, and to destroy her, and she hates it, but she can't stop it. There are thousands of
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:37.280]   people like that in this life at this moment. They don't know the meaning of life and of existence,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.560]   they don't know what they're doing in this world, nor what it's all about, and in this utter
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.800]   blindness and darkness and hopelessness, they're attacked by these other things,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.240]   and they can do nothing about it, they may be overwhelmed at any moment.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:57.520]   Sickness, old age, and death, and on top of it all, the threat of a war,
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.080]   the possibility of something that may shatter and blow up the whole of our civilization.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.160]   Enjoying the life that they're living up to a point and in a measure, and yet always fearful
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.720]   that at any moment it may be smashed, it may end, it all may be taken from them.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.680]   There's a sense of doom in this world. There's a failure of nerve.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:29.280]   Men and women are alarmed and are terrified. All who are not Christian, I say, are full of
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:36.000]   a sense of foreboding as if something terrible is about to happen. Not only sitting in darkness,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:43.200]   but in the very shadow of death. And the result of all this, obviously and inevitably is,
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.800]   that there is no peace. He will guide our feet into the way of peace. If he doesn't come and do
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:56.560]   it, there is no peace. You can't be really happy in that peace and the conditions I've been describing,
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:04.640]   and the world is profoundly unhappy. Oh, God forbid that anybody should think that I'm saying
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.400]   that as a criticism. I say it whatever I may sound with a heart that is full of sorrow.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:21.600]   I'll go further. I frankly cannot understand how anybody can go on living in this world today who
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.160]   is not a Christian. I can't understand it. They've got a courage that I know nothing of.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.520]   Without a hope, without anything. Oh, they're troubled, they're unhappy, they're restless,
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:43.600]   they're nervous. There's no real peace in the world. They have no peace with him. They haven't
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:51.760]   had peace with one another. This condition inevitably leads to that. Well, there is the
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:58.640]   picture that is painted by Zacharias. That was the world in his day that he says is the world
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.400]   into which this Christ of God is coming. And my message tonight is simply to say that it's still
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:12.480]   the same. And that in spite of our best of civilization, the world tonight is as much in
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:20.320]   darkness and in the shadow of death and lacking in peace as it was nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.840]   Let me turn to the other side. The other side of what Zacharias said is this.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.960]   He gives an account and a description of the ministry of his own son, the ministry that John
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.760]   the Baptist was going to exercise, an account of his message. What is it? Well, we can divide it
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.320]   in this way. He says, "Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways." How is he
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   going to do it? Well, first it's this. To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:02.240]   remission of their sins. What a significant statement that is. The first part of the
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:09.360]   ministry of John the Baptist was to give a knowledge to the world of its real need.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:18.320]   Now, in the days of John the Baptist, that was very essential. And it was essential for this
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:28.400]   reason. The Jews at that time, you remember and recall, were conquered by the Roman Empire,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.640]   and they had but have become a mere province or colony of that great Roman Empire.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:40.080]   And the Jews were very restive under all this, and their great
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.480]   anxiety was that they might find deliverance and freedom again.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.680]   They were more politically minded, perhaps, than they'd ever been.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.720]   And they were looking and longing for the coming of their Messiah, the Deliverer,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.640]   the one that had been foretold by their long succession of prophets. They were looking for
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:07.600]   the day of his coming in order that they might be set free and emancipated from this Roman yoke
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.760]   and from the tyranny of this military power that had overcome them and that had mastered them.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.720]   And you see, the first thing, therefore, that was necessary for John the Baptist to do was to
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.320]   disabuse their minds of that fatal error. So the first thing that John the Baptist has to do
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:35.920]   is to show them that their idea and their conception of salvation is entirely false.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   You are to give them knowledge of salvation, says Zacharias to John, by the remission of their
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:49.840]   sins, through the tender mercy of our God. Now I regard this as one of the profoundest
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.720]   principles of all, and it is as relevant tonight as it was when Zacharias first uttered these words.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:06.320]   What's it mean? Well, it means this, that the first message of the gospel when it comes to us
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:14.560]   in the darkness and in the failure that I've been describing is to tell us the cause of our condition.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:23.680]   And the cause of our condition is not military, it's not political, it's not social,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:34.240]   it's none of these things at all. It is but one thing, sin, estrangement from God,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:42.560]   departure from the holding, man denying his own being and his own constitution,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:51.760]   man a rebel against God, man in his blindness setting himself up and not humbling himself
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:58.320]   before God. That's the topic. And as you read the history of the ministry of John the Baptist,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.440]   you find that that was precisely the ministry that John proceeded to exercise.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:12.880]   What was the ministry of John the Baptist? Wasn't it this? He preached the baptism of repentance
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:19.680]   for the remission of sins. That was his one message. He was simply there to tell men and
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:25.760]   women that all their ills and troubles came from this one central cause, their one relationship
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.920]   to God. And that there had been one thing to do and that was to repent, to face their sin,
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:38.560]   to acknowledge it to God and to forsake it and to cast themselves upon his mercy. Repent!
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:50.160]   The baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. And that is precisely the message
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.680]   which the gospel brings to us tonight. You remember the Apostle Paul, one of its greatest,
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   if not his greatest preacher, he reminded the elders of the church at Ephesus that when he'd
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:09.040]   been to preach to them, this was his message, he said that he didn't cease day or night in private
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   and in public to preach what to them? The repentance that is toward God, the faith that
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:21.040]   is toward the Lord Jesus Christ. And my dear friends, this is the message of this gospel to
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:29.200]   this world tonight. All our ills and troubles arise from one thing only, and that is that we
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:38.320]   are sinners against God. We are not in the right relationship to God. Our troubles are not due to
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:47.760]   our circumstances and conditions. Our troubles are due to ourselves. All the ills, whether they're
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.000]   common, whether they're international or national or in different social groups, even in the family
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.960]   unit or in the individual, all of them stem out of this one thing, our wrong relationship to God.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.720]   That's the whole of the Christian message. That's the essence of it. That's the beginning of it.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   And I'm simply here to say what you've heard me say so often. My friend, I hold no hope whatsoever
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.680]   out for you until you realize that the first thing is your relationship to God.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:35.120]   Sin, arrogance against God, flouting of God's will, putting up your own will,
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.960]   living your life and what you think, and spurning the most divine, that's the future ill.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.560]   And what we need is not a new political alignment.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.880]   And what we need is not further social enactment. All these things are all right. I'm not here to
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.280]   say a word against them, have them to your heart's content. Many of them are needed and
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.960]   many of them are absolutely right. But I'm simply here to say this, that if you trust for such things
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.960]   you'll find yourself as hopeless in 10 or 20 or 50 years as you are now, and if the world lasts
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:16.560]   another thousand years, it'll be no better than it is at this moment. Isn't the world blind?
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:23.360]   That's the trouble. We don't realize the cause of our ills. It's not in any of these things,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.840]   it's in this one thing. John says Zacharias is father to him. He's never dead, but the father
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.920]   speaks in prophecy. You are to go before him to give knowledge of salvation unto his people
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.320]   by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.120]   Go and tell them that there's no hope for them until they've humbled themselves before this
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.480]   almighty God. Tell them that what they'll need is not a physical earthly king who'll command an
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.760]   army and get rid of the Roman yoke. The Romans are as much slaves as they are. Tell them that
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:05.600]   let all men lead. Each to the Lord God and to enjoy him. Teach to them the baptism of repentance,
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.120]   fathering mission of sins. That's the first thing. And then that leads on to the second thing.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.720]   Because you see the gospel doesn't stop at the negative repentance,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.040]   the next thing he's got to do is to point them to Christ.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.960]   Tell them, says Zacharias, about the dayspring from on high that has visited us.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:35.360]   You are but a forerunner, you are not the savior, he says to this infant.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:43.440]   You are but to tell them of the one who's coming. And John was very true to his ministry. Do you
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.200]   remember how we read it in the third chapter of this gospel according to Saint Luke at the
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   beginning? There was John preaching at the Jordan and baptizing the people.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:00.160]   He was a strange man to look at. He didn't dress like other people. He'd been living in the
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.440]   wilderness. He'd been eating locusts and wild honey. He'd got nothing on him but a leather
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   girdle and a camel hair shirt. And he spoke like a prophet with his blazing eyes. And he
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.680]   denounced them and he could answer questions. And the people having listened to him began to
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.800]   mutter to one another and said, "Who is this?" All men, we are told, mused in their hearts of John
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.360]   whether he were the Christ or not. They said, "Is this the one? Is this the Messiah? Is this the
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.040]   King? Is this the Deliverer?" John heard them and he switched upon them and turned unto them and said,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.120]   John answered, saying unto them all, "I indeed baptize you with water.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:51.680]   But what mightier than I cometh, the lachet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:58.000]   he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose hand is in his hand,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.240]   and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into his garner.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:11.760]   But he will destroy the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:19.920]   "I'm not the Christ," says John. "He, the coming one, the one who is following me, he's the Christ."
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:30.000]   John fulfilled his ministry perfectly. He was simply the herald of the one who was to follow.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.560]   He always has a finger post pointing to Christ.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:41.520]   And that is still the message of the Christian gospel this evening.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:48.480]   My dear friends, the message of Christmas is not just to say that love is unconquerable.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.520]   The message of Christmas is not just to say that what the world needs is love.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:00.080]   The message of Christmas is not to tell the warring nations and the warring factions within the nations
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.720]   that all they need is to apply the principle of love.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:13.120]   No, no, no, it's not a principle. It's a person. He, the day spring from on high, the Son of God incarnate,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.720]   the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the message.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:28.160]   Not a principle of love, not an idea to be put into practice, but a birth, an infant, a manger,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:36.080]   an helpless infant who grew into manhood and preached and worked miracles, was crucified and died,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:46.480]   and rose again. The day star, the day spring from on high, he points to Christ.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:54.240]   It's all in him. Redemption, deliverance, the way out has come in this person.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:03.680]   And how does he do it? Let me end with this. Here it is again, he has come, the day spring
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:12.080]   from on high hath visited us. What for? To give us the very thing we needed, light. To them that sit
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:18.880]   in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:29.280]   How often does the Bible describe him as light? The prophet described him as the son of righteousness
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:35.680]   that was going to come and to shine with healing in his wings. He's the light to lighten the Gentiles.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.440]   He said himself, I am the light of the world.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:48.320]   He that believeth in me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:56.800]   And what's it mean? Well, it's this, isn't it? Can't you see it? Go back to these people in the
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:03.120]   picture, sitting in the wilderness, in the darkness, giving up in hopelessness and despair,
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.520]   no chance of arriving at the city. They don't know where they are. They're lost. There's no light.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.600]   And the enemies are attacking. And in the midst of the hopelessness, suddenly a mighty headlight,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:19.200]   a flash of beam, and the city at the end of it suddenly appears.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:27.200]   Is it surprising that they begin to sing? Is it surprising that the note of the Bible is one of
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   jubilation and exaltation? Any man who's seen himself in the darkness and the hopelessness
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:40.960]   and then sees the way out, he must rejoice. He jolts to his feet. Like the man at the gate of
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:47.120]   the temple, he was paralyzed and now he's been given strength in his feet and ankle bones,
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.640]   and he goes into the temple of God, leaping and jumping, walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:04.400]   Christ brings the light of hope. It's not hopeless. The philosophers are hopeless.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:12.800]   The scientists are hopeless. The legislators are hopeless. All men are hopeless because we see the
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.680]   failure and we know that we can't get rid of this cunt of evil that is within us.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:26.800]   But the Son of God has brought light into the world. There is hope. There is a way.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:35.200]   When man fails, God begins. With God, nothing shall be impossible. All things are possible with God.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:43.440]   Here is the new message. And what is the light he gives us? Well, it's the light I say we need.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:50.960]   And the light that you and I all need by nature in this world is light on how to arrive at God
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:58.720]   and the knowledge of God. And here it is to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:05.680]   the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God, whereby - you notice the words?
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.120]   That's how it all happens. It's this dayspring from on high that has come
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.760]   that makes the remission of sins possible through the tender mercy of the God who sent him.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.600]   And the light that Christ gives tonight is just this,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   how privileged I am to be allowed to stand in a pulpit and say it.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:36.800]   I care not, my friend, how dark your life has been. I care not how hopeless you have felt.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.600]   I care not if the world has robbed you of everything that makes life precious.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:51.200]   I care not if it robbed you, as I say, of your morality and your chastity and your purity.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:58.480]   You may be a thief and a robber and a drunkard and an adulterer and worse things.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:04.640]   You may have been anything, I care not. The world may have dismissed you and dubbed you as a refuse of society.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:12.240]   I'm here to tell you that in Jesus Christ there is eternal hope for you.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:18.400]   That through him and his atoning death and his mighty resurrection,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:26.640]   your sins have been dealt with and God is ready to forgive you, to give the knowledge of salvation
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of God. The cause of it
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.360]   all, I say, is that you're estranged from God, that you don't know him, that you're not receiving
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.240]   strength and power from him. You want to get back to God. How can you get back to God? You can't.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.920]   You can't get rid of your sins. You can't get rid of the clout. Christ has done it. The way is open.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:47:00.880]   God forgives you freely in Christ. He reconciles you to God. You but go to him and confess your
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:06.720]   sins to him and tell him of your hopelessness and he will tell you, he'll whisper into your ear
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.760]   that he's died for your sins because he loved you and that your sins are washed away and blotted out
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:19.920]   and that God receives you fully and graciously. He'll also give you a knowledge of God.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:27.520]   He'll take away the old wrong idea of God as one who's set against you and he'll so depict God to
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.240]   you that you'll love him and you'll desire him. You'll want to keep his laws. You'll want to
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:38.000]   magnify his name. You'll come to a point in which you'll say, "I care not what the world may take
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.400]   from me as long as I know God and I'm with him all is well with my soul."
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:55.520]   When peace like a river tendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot,
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:04.880]   thou hast taught me to say, "It is well. It is well with my soul." Christ will enable you to say
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:10.240]   that. When all is gone and everything is given way, still you're with God.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:18.960]   And you're afraid of nothing. And he'll give you new life and teach you how to live
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:25.200]   and strengthen you and accompany you. And of course the result of all this, as
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.080]   Zacharias put it, is this, that he will be guiding our feet into the way of peace.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:39.200]   Peace with God, you see, first. And because you're at peace with God,
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:48.000]   you begin to experience peace within. The old hopelessness and the useless remorse, they go.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.200]   Because remorse is useless, you kick yourself. You're annoyed with yourself, but you don't feel
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   happy. You haven't found peace. You know you'll go and do it again. But with Christ you get peace
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.720]   with God. You know your sins have been done away with. They've gone. They've vanished.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:14.000]   Peace with God and therefore peace within yourself. And even peace with other people.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:22.640]   Because you begin to look at them in a new way, you don't see them as hateful creatures,
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:29.520]   but as victims of Satan and of hell, of sin and of evil. And you say, "Yes, it's the men
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:34.160]   who still where I was. If only they were delivered." You're sorry for them.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:45.200]   And you have pity upon them. Peace with God. Peace within. Peace with one another.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.680]   That is what Christ does. And is it not surprising that these people sing?
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:58.560]   How can a man but sing, who's been in that hopelessness and darkness and despair,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:11.440]   and suddenly sees the light of God in the face of Jesus Christ? That's the message of Christmas.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:21.600]   That is what Christ came into the world to do. Blessed be his name. That is what he's done.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:33.280]   He came from the eternal light of glory into the darkness of this world, in order that you and I
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:42.240]   and all others who are sitting in darkness and hopelessness and despair might have this light.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:55.600]   That leads to God and that will eventually lead us to glory. Blessed be the name of God. Amen.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:02.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
