[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   It's Monday and today Monday means live career-related or income-related Q&A.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:39.360]   [Music]
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Special live Q&A today which is open to
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   the entire audience. We are specifically today speaking about careers and incomes. So how to
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.400]   make more money doing work you love. That is the topic of all of our questions on today's show.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.200]   [Music]
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.640]   I did not record a podcast live Q&A on Friday so we're doing it here on Monday and once again all
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.280]   of the questions today are related to career and income planning. This is part of our launch
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   celebration for the new course that I am teaching called the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   and Income Planning. How to earn a lot of money doing work you love. I don't know if that's a
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.360]   cliche or not but it is indeed true. And on today's show I have a bunch of callers lined up where we
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.120]   will be talking in detail about career problems and career issues. What you'll be hearing here
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.840]   is just me live advice. So if any of this seems useful, if any of this seems good, number one,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.160]   if you don't want to buy anything from me, take it and apply it to your own life. That is my
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   ideal outcome. A good teacher always wants their students to learn and to apply. And the best
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.600]   emails that I get are the emails that where a student or a listener says, "Joshua, I did
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.240]   something with what you said." And so that will be exciting. But if any of this is useful to you,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.880]   you will probably hear me refer to some module of the course or some particular concept. I'm not
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   holding anything back. I'll be talking through it all today. But if this is useful, please be aware
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.520]   that we are currently having a four-week launch for the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.760]   and Income Planning. Launch window closes on Wednesday, June 6th, but your next price increase
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   will come on Wednesday, May 16th. Sorry, the end of day, May 15th. So as this releases on Monday,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.240]   you have until Tuesday night if you would like to get the course at the lowest possible cost.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   So I'd love for you, if you have any interest, to come by and sign up. Go to
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.960]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome. We begin with Tanya in Maryland. Tanya,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.480]   tell me about your career and what you're struggling with and how I can serve you today, please.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.160]   Thank you, Joshua, for taking my call. What I wanted to figure out is I know that you like
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   to teach concepts, and I think they're extremely useful. And what I wanted to know is what are your
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.200]   plans to help people on the course specifically to take those ideas and concepts and apply them
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.080]   for their specific industries and for their specific businesses or jobs that they do?
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.120]   Sure, it's a fair question. And in the course, I actually have a module called
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   kind of the tension between philosophy and action. And here is the challenge as I see it.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.320]   Philosophy doesn't change your life. Only action does. Only specific actions actually change
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.920]   anything. You can read all you want about being a great cook. You can watch all the TV shows about
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.720]   how to be a great cook. But until you actually go in the kitchen and start messing things up,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.320]   you're not going to be a great cook. And so action is important. And I always want to have a bias
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.080]   towards action. The problem is if you only have action, you may quickly outgrow your action.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.920]   Now, if you had to choose between philosophy and action, I guess you would usually choose action
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.320]   because action is what's needed for change. But if you change philosophy, you'll have an automatic
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.640]   change of action. A simple reality would be this. Let's use an example related to work and to
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:31.440]   income. If you go into your company with the philosophy that when they pay me more,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.920]   then I'll work harder, you'll have a very different experience than if you go in with
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   the philosophy of I'm going to work harder so they'll pay me more. If I only changed,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   let's say I were working with a young person who had a philosophy that they need to pay me
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.840]   more money so I'll work harder. If you just change that one thought and you expose that philosophy as
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.880]   a fallacy to say that, well, when I work harder, then they'll pay me more, and rather you said no,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.000]   when... Well, I messed it up. You get the point. When you say no, that's actually,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.600]   why don't you work harder so they'll pay you more? That'll naturally have an effect. So I think both
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.880]   are important. And I think that if you had to choose, you want to take action. But if you
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.360]   understand the philosophy, you'll be able to take action. Now, what I see missing in the modern
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.160]   world of career planning is philosophy that's applicable no matter where you are. Because
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.680]   in many ways, careers in business and work is very simple. It's as simple as this. If you have a job,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   your job is to make your boss happy and make sure that you make more money for your company
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   than you cost them. That's it. That's really it. When I was a kid, my dad said, "Find out who your
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.200]   boss is and make them happy." He didn't go into all the details and make your money more than
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   you cost them. But if you'll just go into your company and you find out who your boss is and
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.280]   make them happy, you'll have a blissfully productive career. So that philosophy is simple.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.320]   The problem is that people give too much tactic and they talk about how to be more responsive
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.000]   to email. Why should you be responsive to email? And so there's so much that's all around tactics
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   that's not around principles. And so what I do try to focus on is philosophy and is principle.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.680]   But to specifically answer your question, I do also try to help you apply it. So I want to give
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.200]   you ideas, but then help you apply them to your life and give you examples in your own specific
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   industry and in your own specific niche. So Tanya, tell me a little bit about your career and a
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.760]   specific problem that you are struggling with. And let's see if we can give you one or two specific
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.000]   ideas that will help you make more money and enjoy your work life more.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Sure. So first of all, I am lucky that I do make enough money for myself and for my family. But I
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.560]   also see that there is a huge potential to make more. And what I do, I work in the pharmaceutical
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   industry and I actually have my own consulting business. I can be just like another consultant
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:13.040]   on down the road. But I actually think that I have certain ideas how to carve out a niche that
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.400]   and grow that niche. I do not, though, have a plan written out and very well thought through,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:30.720]   which I do need to have. And so having ideas to bounce off someone or some kind of plan that would
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   help me be accountable would be helpful. So as a consultant, are you paid exclusively
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.000]   based upon the number of consulting contracts and the size of those contracts by your customers?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.400]   Yes, absolutely. And they vary either paid hourly or paid by project. But yes, all I bring
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:01.840]   a client and we have a project either on an ongoing basis or one off, and that's the money I get.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.000]   Okay. And is your goal currently to increase the revenue and profit of your consulting company?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.520]   Yes, that's my goal.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.680]   Okay. So let me give you something practical and let's talk about philosophy and tactics. And I'm
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.320]   just going to give you philosophy. This is one module from the course, but the tactics are going
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.440]   to be very difficult for you to apply, but the philosophy will give you the roadmap to grow on.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.600]   So in a business, and you have a business, as a consultant, you have a business. In a business,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.040]   your goal is to generate profit. Profit is defined as revenue minus expenses. For most
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.520]   consulting companies that are what I'm imagining yours to be, you don't generally deal with a lot
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.200]   of expenses. If you had a manufacturing company, if you had a lot of employees, generally there's a
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.840]   lot, then that's when you need to move into expenses more. But as a consultant, usually,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.160]   from what I'm perceiving you to say, you're probably just a single shopper. You have a few
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.760]   staff members, but it's relatively small. So your main opportunity is in revenue. And in a business,
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.080]   the only way to increase your profit is to either increase your revenue or decrease your expenses.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.040]   And most likely your big opportunity is to increase revenue. If your expenses are out of
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.040]   hand, you should decrease them and that will increase profit. But your biggest opportunity
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.920]   is to increase revenue. So in any business, there are only four things that you can change that will
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.720]   change the revenue of your business. There are only four. You should write these down, go back,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.840]   listen to them later, because I'm going to go through them quickly. The number one thing you
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.520]   can do to increase revenue is to increase the number of customers that you serve. All else
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.600]   being equal, if you have 10 consulting clients and you increase that to 15 consulting clients,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.640]   you will increase the revenue and you will automatically then increase your profit as
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.560]   long as your expenses aren't as long as you have a profitable company. So you can, number one,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.000]   increase the number of customers that you serve. Number two, you can increase the average size of
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.240]   each transaction by selling more. That's number two, increase the average size of each transaction
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.720]   by selling more. So if your current consulting contract is an average size of $10,000, but you
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   can sell more to that particular client because of additional value, additional services, whatever,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.920]   to $15,000, you'll increase revenue. That's good. Number three, the only number three option you
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.000]   have is to increase the frequency of transactions per customer. So you could have a customer that
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   usually buys one contract from you at $10,000 each year, but now that particular customer can now
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.240]   engage in two contracts with you each year for a total of $20,000. Or option number four is you can
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.720]   raise your prices. The next consulting client that you bring on, you just simply charge them
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.800]   more money. Those are the four ways that you increase revenue in a business. You, one,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.680]   increase the number of customers you serve. Two, increase the average size of each transaction by
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.120]   selling more. Three, increase the frequency of transactions per customer. Or four, raise your
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.720]   prices. That's it. I don't know of any other change that you can make that will ever affect
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.760]   the revenue of your business. So business is very simple. Any business, any consulting business,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.520]   any storefront, any business whatsoever can sit down and look at these four things. Now, the key
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:26.240]   is you have to then analyze which of these is your biggest opportunity. You have to look at it and say
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.960]   which of these is going to give me the best chance for growth. So for some customers, let's say in a
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.160]   consulting company, you currently have three clients, but you know you have a lot more capacity
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.560]   and you know there are more clients that are out there for you. Most likely, the simplest and
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.280]   easiest way for you to grow is to bring on more clients. If you have the capacity, you just say,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.400]   "I'm going to bring on three more clients." Now, if you're in a situation where your time is full,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.480]   you have no more time, you're working 40 hours a week, you have six clients, and you just can't
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   handle any more, now you look at it and say, "Well, is there another opportunity for me to grow?"
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.880]   You could increase the average size of each transaction by selling more. And this is where
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.040]   you would look at your consulting business and you would say, "Well, in my particular business,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:22.080]   can I sell more without particularly adding more time for me? Is my consulting input versus output
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   linear or is it multiplicative? If I sell them more, am I going to have to increase the number
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.640]   of hours by the same amount that I've sold them or do I just need to increase my input and my
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.440]   output just my input a little bit and my output will increase substantially?" So you would look
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.000]   at that and analyze, "Is that the best move or should I increase the frequency of transactions
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.600]   per customer? Is my customer base the type that they would buy more things from me if they just
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.440]   simply had more opportunity and so let me have them come into my storefront, whether they're
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.960]   virtual or real, more frequently or do I just raise my prices?" Most of the time in consulting,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.200]   your best opportunity is going to be increase the number of customers you serve and raise your
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.560]   prices. But it all comes down to how much time do you have, et cetera. So that's a good example of
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.200]   how philosophy, if you understand the philosophy, then you'll have to do the hard work of analyzing
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.560]   your business. And I couldn't hope to have the actual details of your business to actually know
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.800]   for sure, yes, this is the specific thing that you should do. But my hope is that by talking
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.200]   through the concepts and just the very cursory way that I've done there, you can take that and
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.640]   look at your business and try to say, "Okay, with my business now, how do I actually put this into
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.000]   practice? Where's my low-hanging fruit?" And in any business, this should be for most people
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.480]   relatively straightforward. I know for mine, if I just look at these four things, it's obvious to me
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.280]   where to focus. And in most businesses, it's obvious where to focus. There are times where
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.680]   it's a little bit less obvious and you'll have to take that. So hopefully those ideas would be a
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.160]   good example of philosophy and you can take them and study your business. And if that's helpful,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.240]   I'd love to have you join me. Again, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/increaseincome.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.960]   And here's the thing. Your biggest opportunity is to spend... On today's show, I'm going to be
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   moving very quickly because I got a bunch of callers on the line and I'm trying to target
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.280]   an hour-long show. But in the course, I'll answer as everything that I possibly can. Just like any
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.560]   good class, I'm convinced more than half the value of the course is just working with me and other
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.080]   students in specifics for your situation. So I hope that helps you, Tania. We go to Mario in
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.160]   Norway. Mario, how can I serve you today as it relates to career and income planning?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:39.600]   Yes. Hi, Joshua. Thank you very much for taking my call. Well, the question I have is I'm
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:47.120]   developing a basic course program like a part-time job. I also work as an engineer in the oil business
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:55.280]   here in Norway for today. But this basic coaching program is about a young professional. So my
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.120]   question is, what do you think should be the strategy to reach more young professionals
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:08.640]   to help them elevate their financial education, you know, to do good or bad regarding management
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.280]   their money from early stage in life? Where I should focus my energy to try to reach people?
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   That is not an easy question. When you talk about creating educational products,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.680]   how do you imagine, in a perfect world, how do you imagine delivering this information and education?
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:40.160]   Well, what I'm doing is trying to contact people who I can work with them for a period of time.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.560]   Let's say it has to be a minimum of three to four months in a one-to-one basis. Of course,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:55.920]   I want to focus basically in what I think about is try to help them first visualize where they are
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:03.040]   regarding the financial situation. And of course, what came to my mind is when people start making
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.240]   money as a professional, I mean, they just finish the university, graduate, and then of course,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:15.840]   they get all the advertising and everything and try to get a lifestyle according to what they are
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:22.000]   starting to earn. So I have been there. So that's what I'm thinking. It would be very nice just to
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.800]   try to teach people to do better. But I have been dumb. I mean, I have 20 years career as an
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.960]   engineer. So I have always been working as an engineer earning quite good money, but also I was
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:41.520]   quite spending a lot. But I'm in a good position anyway. And are you trying to actually build a
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.400]   business from this endeavor that would support you? Or is this just a labor of love?
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:54.160]   Both, I would say. Because actually, what I would like in a point is to jump from my
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.920]   engineering career to just a coaching career, I would call it financial coach. But it's just
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.000]   to help young people to organize this. Because I really, really enjoy that very much, to be honest.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.160]   So I actually working on that. So I would like to do that. And I started trying this
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.800]   kind of launching a better coaching program to do that.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:26.480]   So this question is one of the hardest that I can possibly imagine. And frankly, I don't have a good
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.200]   answer for you because I don't really believe it's possible. But I'll explain that so that you can
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.120]   understand. Now, obviously, I would be quick to affirm that nothing is impossible. You just got
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.160]   to find the right way. But I don't know how this can be done. I don't know how to do it. I don't
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.280]   know how it can be done in the way that you're describing it. Let me tell you why. When it comes
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:54.240]   to money and trying to teach people about money, you have a couple of unique challenges. First,
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.000]   you're dealing with a subject that some people are interested in and that many people are simply not.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.960]   Most people don't care about their money. Now, if you tell them that to their face,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   they'll quickly say, "Well, I actually do." But the reality is that most people simply don't care
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.360]   about their money. If they cared about their money, they would pay attention to it and they
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.920]   would actually do something about it. But they obviously don't because they don't pay attention
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   and they don't do anything about it. So most people just don't really care about their money.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.400]   They only care about their money insofar as they can use it and spend it as they want to and earn
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.640]   it. And they think it'd be nice to have a little bit more, but they don't actually demonstrate that
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.040]   it's nice to have a little bit more by actually doing something. Don't mean to be overly harsh,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.480]   but that's truth as I see it. So most people don't care. The people that do care about their money
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.040]   actually are probably already likely to do something about it. There's so much information.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:55.600]   I can't, I mean, is there a subject that's talked more about than money? I don't know what it is. I
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.560]   mean, if you expand money to its full scope in every area of our life that's discussed about,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.520]   I don't know of a subject that's discussed more. It's certainly, it's a constant. Is there a
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.040]   subject that's been written about more than money? I don't, there's so much from ancient
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:19.600]   texts till today. I mean, you can go through the Bible. Jesus talks more about money in the Bible
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.640]   than faith or heaven or anything that people usually associate with being a religious topic.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.240]   Most people, there's more written about money than almost anything else. So is there anything
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.720]   that could be actually created that was new? I don't think, not much. There's just different
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.680]   variations of it. So you have a problem of people aren't really interested. Well, what about the
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.440]   people who are interested? And the people who are interested for kind of quick and dirty analysis
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   probably fall into two buckets, those that have money and those that don't have money.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:03.360]   And here's the basic problem. Those that have money don't need to know how to make more of it.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.240]   And those who don't have money don't have any money to pay you to help them get some. So
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.840]   you wind up looking at the people that you want to help, those who don't have money,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.400]   and saying, "Well, I want to help you, but I don't know how to help you because you don't
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.040]   have any money to pay me." So the only thing I know to do this is to possibly these two ideas.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.800]   Number one, the best value for you to build a business is found in serving the wealthy
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.760]   because they have money and they can buy things from you. Because teaching people about money or
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:43.920]   coaching them about money is not an actual necessity, because of that, you can't sell it
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.880]   in the same way that you can sell rice to poor people and make a living. If I tried to sell
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:56.240]   financial advice to poor people, I wouldn't make a living unless I could sell it for very
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.480]   inexpensive, which is media. I'll come to in just a moment. So the best way for you to build a
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:08.080]   business is for you to actually go and serve the people that have money. But if you're going to
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.400]   serve the people that have money, you have to bring some particular value that's of value to
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.960]   them. And this is where the world of financial planning comes up. The world of professional
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.520]   financial advice is very good at helping people who have money get more of it or helping people
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:30.400]   who have money to hold on to what they have. So if you become somebody like a tax expert
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.000]   and you can help engineers living in Norway keep more of their money from the Norwegian tax system,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.440]   you can sell that advice because you can put a specific monetary value on it. You can say,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.640]   "Look, I'll charge you $1,000, but I'll save you $5,000." Well, any person with money will take
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.800]   that deal all day long. Or you can sell investment advice or you can sell services of some kind,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:59.120]   whether those services are as normal as bookkeeping or if they're as esoteric as,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.800]   "I'll help you hide your money in the Caribbean islands so that you get it out of the European
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.520]   system." I don't know what issues are appropriate to the Norwegian scenario. But you can make a lot
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.600]   of money selling good care of money to rich people. But it's hard to make a lot of money
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.120]   selling good care of money to poor people. About the only way to do it is if you can have a giant
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:27.040]   number of customers with a very low cost of servicing those customers with a small transaction
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.080]   size. That's what I'm doing. That's what radical personal finance is. Because my cost of reaching
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:38.800]   many people is extremely low, I can afford to do what I'm doing right now. I can create education
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   that can reach a mass audience. And it doesn't matter to me in terms of costs, whether 10,000
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.520]   people are listening to me or 100,000 people are listening to me. It costs me the same amount every
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:58.800]   month. So I can create a large free option to serve people who may not have a lot of money.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.400]   And then I can use that as a marketing process to attract the people who do have money
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.800]   to my other opportunities to pay me for stuff, whether that's coaching or a product or advice
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:18.880]   or something like that. But I couldn't sell $400 courses on how to build an incredible career and
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.960]   increase your income to people who are broke. They don't have the money to do it. Now, if they
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:30.240]   were wise, they should. I have no problem whatsoever encouraging somebody who's broke to invest in
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.480]   their income. But on the whole, it's been my experience that people don't generally do that.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.120]   They should. I did. I used to have done it. I've seen people who do it. But those people,
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.960]   they're out there and I hope I can serve them. But I'm just speaking generally as far as a
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.920]   business is hard to do. So the only way that I can see that you can actually do a business helping
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.760]   people who don't have money is if you can serve them in a large number. That would come down to
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.040]   speaking, speaking fees. That would come down to creating products that can be distributed widely.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.800]   So if you want to work with high school students and you create a high school curriculum or you
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.000]   want to become a lecturer or you want to create a particular product, et cetera, but I don't know
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.600]   how you can work with individuals. And that's the nutty problem about money. I really don't see any
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.920]   big solution to solve it. But what I would encourage you to do is to say, "Do I really
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   want to do this and help poor people or do I want to do this and help rich people?" If you want to
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.240]   help rich people, go into the professions and find an opportunity where with your profession,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.080]   you can actually help them, save money on taxes, help them invest better, et cetera.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.240]   Rich people will pay constantly for good financial advice. Or if you want to help people who aren't
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.800]   rich yet, then look at it in service and try to figure out how can I build an audience for my
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.040]   service and then try to figure out what that particular audience needs in terms of service.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   But I wouldn't, unless it's a labor of love for you, I wouldn't jump out of an engineering career
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.680]   first off to try to go and help poor people. The best people who have the opportunity to help
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.800]   poor people are those who are in their life naturally. So I think back to a high school
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.520]   teacher that I had. He was an economics teacher. In the school that I graduated from high school,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:24.800]   all of the people in that school were required to take instruction in economics. And this teacher
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.360]   worked very diligently to labor and to lay for his students a good foundation in personal finance.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.240]   He took it very seriously. It was very simple, but he was really good. But he had hundreds of
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:44.880]   students per year coming in through his classes. And a small percentage of those students were
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.560]   able to actually put those things in place. So if you can figure out some way to put yourself
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:57.680]   in the position where somebody is going to be forced to work with you, then possibly you can
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.920]   help them. But it's a hard question. I know a lot of people in the personal finance
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.840]   punditry world and doing what I do who don't know how to solve it. I don't know it either.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:12.400]   What you hear is my very best attempt to do what you're saying. So check back in a few years and
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.440]   I'll report on the results. Andrew in Maine, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:24.880]   sir? Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the phone call. So like I said, when we first spoke, I'm a
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   carpenter, fairly rural Maine. I have not lived in the area for too long. And it seems the only
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:39.120]   thing I can do to increase my income is either raise my price or hire people and just get more
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:48.400]   jobs. I'm kind of wary of being a huge company, a big crew. I like to offer solo craftsmanship.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.800]   I'm really one-on-one with a customer. Everybody seems really happy. But it seems like there's a
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:01.440]   ceiling as far as trades go. So I didn't know what you might have for input on that.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:10.160]   Where do your customers currently come from? Mostly word of mouth. Just to give you an idea,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.080]   we have a website my wife made. I got to actually compliment on it the other day.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.800]   I'm one of like four people. What's your website?
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   LibertyTimbers.com. Okay. So we're going to try to increase your business. If anyone wants to see
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.960]   what Andrew in rural Maine can create for custom woodwork, you can go to LibertyTimbers.com. Go
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:36.320]   ahead, Andrew. Keep going. Yeah. Thanks. I'm one of like three people in this area that even has a
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:44.000]   website. So I get phone calls off my website. I leave cards around town. I talk to just about
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:57.280]   everyone I know. And word of mouth seems to be the best way to build a lasting trade business.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.760]   Just from everybody I've talked to and things like that. Mass marketing doesn't really work
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.840]   around here. But I live on the coast. There's really, really high-end coastal homes. And I like
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.000]   really fine woodworking. So it kind of works that way. Like I said, it seems like there's a price
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:26.320]   ceiling and slowly working up, but it can only go so fast. And it's a challenge working 40 hours a
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:37.120]   week with a family, also meeting people for future work. And just, you know, things are going well.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:44.960]   I'm not employed as a carpenter. That doesn't seem to go very well for anybody. But self-employed
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.920]   seems like a pretty good niche for me. I'm fairly young and it's a dying breed. So
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.960]   that's kind of where I'm at with my whole business.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:03.440]   - So from looking at your website, it looks like you do a lot of, you're primarily,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:09.600]   you're doing carpentry, fine carpentry, but it's very much residential as far as working on houses.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.000]   You work on houses, you do home restoration and remodeling, you're doing some timber framing.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.840]   So you're not creating furniture. What you're doing is you're creating structures. Is that
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.240]   accurate? - Yeah. And I have a background in making,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.640]   I mean, I can make furniture and my wife and I always joke about the tables that you see for
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:35.360]   $15,000. I mean, I know how to make those. I don't know how to sell those, but yeah, I do restoration.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:42.640]   I do remodeling, mostly things like that. And I work right now, it's just me. I like that because
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:49.520]   I'm reliable and I show up and I don't steal my own tools. So I'll keep things, you know,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.920]   I keep things fluid as far as my family life and my business life.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.440]   - Right. - And yeah.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:06.320]   - So here's what, how I would, here's the direction that I would turn you on. In the course,
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:14.400]   I give a case study of, so I look at a lot of businesses and I enjoy seeing particular businesses
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.800]   and I enjoy analyzing those businesses from people who are in weird niches that I come across. So let
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.080]   me tell you about one that I profile in the course. The website is powerstrokehelp.com.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.800]   Now I stumbled across this particular website when I was building or when I was researching
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.120]   Ford diesel engines. I needed to buy a diesel pickup truck and I was researching Ford diesel
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.840]   engines. And particularly the problem that I was researching was an engine called the Ford
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.160]   six liter diesel engine. This engine, when Ford created it, was known, it was supposed to be a
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   great engine, but it had all kinds of problems. And so I was trying to decide, there is a glut of
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.920]   them on the marketplace where you can get a newer pickup for pretty cheap because these engines are
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:05.040]   so considered to be major problems. And I didn't know, should I go with a six liter or should I go
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.680]   with one of the other engines? Because it seems like there's a big supply, price is cheap, but I
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.480]   don't want to have problems and diesel engines are particularly problematic. So I stumbled across
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:22.000]   this guy who has this website called powerstrokehelp.com. Now what he does, he exclusively
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.120]   works on Ford diesel engines. But the model of his website that I'm going to describe to you
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   is a model that you can take and apply to your industry and anybody else who's in some industry,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:42.800]   even if it's something like you, where you have localized custom work. Now, I think, although
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.520]   I haven't researched this, I think the guy who wrote it, his name is Bill Hewitt. I think he
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:55.120]   probably started just like any other mechanic, just working on cars. Now in that approach to
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.640]   learning to work on cars, at some point in time, he became interested in diesel engines. And so
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.680]   he specialized in diesel engines. And this is one of the things that's super important is when you
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:12.000]   find a specialty that's in demand to specialize down. In a modern market economy, the more
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.400]   specialized you are, the more money you can make because the supply of people who, the supply of
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.640]   workers who are able to do that work will be much smaller. So you can see this in many industries.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.080]   You should see it in the construction industry. Somebody who is perhaps a specialized
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:42.240]   Finnish carpenter for boats, who only does Finnish carpentry on boats, should in your area,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.000]   if you have boats on the coast of Maine and if this is in demand, should command a higher hourly
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   wage or a higher rate than somebody who does Finnish carpentry on houses. And both of those
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.360]   Finnish carpenters should command a higher hourly rate than somebody who just does general carpentry.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   Now, this is subject to there actually being a demand for the work. A Finnish carpenter
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:13.600]   who does Finnish carpentry on boats but lives in the Sahara Desert is going hungry. They're not
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   earning a higher wage. They're going hungry. So there has to be a demand. But if there's a demand
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   for work, then you'll make more money as a specialist. A physician who is a specialist
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.520]   can command a higher hourly rate or a higher wage than is a physician who is a generalist.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:36.880]   And this basically applies to any industry, any company. The work of somebody who's at the top
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.080]   is more specialized than the work of somebody who's at the bottom. And this is one of the
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.600]   reasons why they get paid more money. So the first career, not having spoken to him, just analyzing
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.000]   his website, the first career move that I would bet Bill Hewitt made was he went from being a
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.160]   general mechanic to being a diesel mechanic. The next move that he made was to become not just a
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.440]   diesel mechanic but to become interested in Ford diesels, exclusively power stroke diesels. He
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.040]   doesn't work on Chevys. He doesn't work on Dodges. He only works on Ford power stroke diesels. And
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.920]   because of his expertise with Ford power stroke diesels, he developed an inside specialized
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:22.000]   knowledge, which makes him much more valuable as a mechanic than some other people. Years ago,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.200]   I owned a Honda Accord. And one of the major benefits that I had with this Honda Accord
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:33.760]   is I lived a few blocks away from my mechanic who only worked on Hondas, and if he was feeling
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:40.160]   generous, a Toyota every now and then. But for over 30 years, he had worked exclusively on Hondas.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:47.280]   And so what this gave him was a vast background of information. And it always kept me with the
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.720]   cheapest bills possible because he could diagnose my car so fast. So because of his breadth of
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.080]   experience with Hondas, he always knew, "Oh, this particular year of Honda, they had this one
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.000]   problem and he would just swap out the part and it would cost me 60 bucks. Whereas if I took that
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.920]   car to the general mechanic, it would cost $200, an extra $140 for the time of diagnosis." He knew
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:14.000]   those things right off the bat. I have no idea how much he ever charged me for anything. I just
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.320]   knew that he charged, he was so fast at fixing things and doing things because he'd done it so
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:24.480]   many times that my price was cheaper, but I'll bet his hourly rate was higher because he could do
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.080]   things faster. So as I'm telling you this story, Andrew, be thinking about the parallels to the
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.200]   construction industry and your competence as a master craftsman in a particular niche.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:42.000]   So back to Bill Hewitt of Ford Power Strokes. So I would guess that he built a specialized
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.840]   business, but along the way, about 10 years ago, he pulled out his video camera
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.880]   and he started taking videos and putting those videos on YouTube. And he started telling other
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.840]   people about Power Stroke engines and started talking about the benefits and the problems of
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.240]   those engines. Well, on his YouTube channel today, 10 years later, he has, I don't know if it's
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.680]   thousands, I don't have it right in front of me, but he has something, he has probably thousands,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:16.080]   hundreds, if not thousands of videos on his YouTube channel. And he has 112,000 subscribers
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:24.720]   to his Power Stroke Help YouTube channel. Now, what has he done with that? Well,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:31.520]   he's expanded. First of all, he does still offer mechanical services. He probably spins a wrench
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.800]   every now and then himself, but more importantly, he's outside of Atlanta in Georgia. He has a shop
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.360]   with multiple mechanics and the only vehicles they work on are Ford Power Stroke engines.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.400]   But that shop, because of their specialization, is in such high demand that they not only pull
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.440]   customers from their local area in Atlanta, they pull customers from across the country.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:57.280]   He tells stories on his YouTube channel of how he has customers who will buy a truck,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.640]   a pickup truck in California, and they'll specifically buy a six-liter Ford with low
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.360]   miles, but that's older, but has low miles. They'll buy it in California. They'll put it
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.280]   on the trailer and ship it from California to Atlanta, Georgia in order for him to pay him
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.560]   about $15,000 for what's called in the industry bulletproofing. They do all these things to fix
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.960]   the studs on a six-liter engine, fix out all the problem parts, and basically take the six-liter
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.360]   engine from a problematic engine to a really great engine because it's been out for so long,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.600]   they know how to fix the problems. So these guys will buy a pickup truck in California,
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.160]   used pickup truck with 30,000 miles, ship it to Atlanta, Georgia, pay him $15,000,
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.320]   and then ship it back out to California for them. And they'll do that all the time.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.120]   And so he's got this shop where not only is he drawing on a customer base locally,
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.080]   but he's drawing on a regional and even national customer base for the actual work. So he has a
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.640]   big shop with a bunch of mechanics working for him. That's one revenue line. Notice how the
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.240]   revenue lines have increased from generalists to diesel specifics, then to diesel specifics on
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:10.800]   Fords. And this man today is the nationally known person on diesel engines. If there's anybody who
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.920]   looks at diesel engines, researches them, works on them, it's hard for me to imagine that they
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.640]   don't at least every now and then stumble across his work because it's so specialized.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.840]   So he dominates this market for work. But what he's also done is he's now taken that expertise
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.200]   and he's translated it into other lines of revenue. On his website, he sells educational
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.880]   products. He has some of them that are free, which are for owners, but he has educational
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.480]   products for power stroke owners and mechanics. And he has them for each of the Ford diesel
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.000]   engines. And he'll sell subscriptions to these courses, which are basically him with a video
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.760]   camera telling people how to diagnose and how to fix all of the problems with their diesel engines.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.600]   So he sells these courses. In addition, he also has other lines of revenue from his website,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.640]   such as the sale of products. He sells some oil products. He sells some different things that
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   will help your engine run better. He doesn't sell a lot of it, but he sells some. And I assume he
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.120]   makes some commission revenue from that as well. Also, he has other lines of revenue, such as
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.160]   fixing up and selling trucks. So what they'll do is they'll have people who are looking for a
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   particular truck, and these are people who need the truck to do a serious job. And they'll call
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.840]   them and say, "I'm looking for a truck with these attributes. Can you find it?" And they want his
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.920]   expertise to find it. They don't care where he gets it, but they care that he goes over it and
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.960]   he fixes it up. And he sells them at high prices to people who demand these vehicles. They'll also
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.120]   take other vehicles that are broken down and they'll bring them in and he'll fix them up. And
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.640]   then he sells them on his YouTube channel. So just about every week on his YouTube channel,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.200]   he'll post a video, a 20-minute video of him and one of his guys walking around their lot,
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.080]   showing all the Power Stroke trucks that are for sale. And today, if I were looking for a Power
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:02.560]   Stroke truck of the vintage that he likes to deal in, I would very likely go and buy it from him.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.480]   I would add to the cost of probably a few extra thousand dollars over something that I could find
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.520]   locally and at the cost of going to Georgia. Because he's eliminating, he's solving a major
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.640]   problem for buyers of used vehicles, which is confidence in the quality of the vehicle.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.080]   That's why used vehicles don't sell well, partly because some of their expected lifespan is used
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.560]   up, but partly because of the risk that you take in buying a used vehicle, which has nobody standing
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   behind it. So he's built this particular business where he stands behind it. His guys have gone over
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:38.960]   that truck from tip to tail and fixed everything on it. So you have a high confidence and you're
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:45.600]   willing to go in and he's selling a 2004 Excursion here for $36,000. And I'm sure he'll sell it. He
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.240]   sells a lot of trucks. So I use that as an example. That's a case study that I go over in the course.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:57.680]   I use that as an example to talk about how you actually can take a business that most people
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:06.080]   would look at and say, "Well, it's just a matter of, I just work on trucks. How can I expand this?"
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.800]   And you can say, "How can I apply business thinking to my lines of revenue and try to figure out how
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.240]   do I grow my lines of revenue?" So in a business like yours, specifically Andrew, you could probably
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:21.520]   do a similar thing. Now you may not be able to do the same thing because the specific attributes of
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.400]   your business are different. If you live in rural Maine and most of your work is done on physical
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.760]   structures, remodeling, local timber frame construction, et cetera, then you're going to be
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.680]   limited based upon your pool of customers. If Bill Hewitt were on a Caribbean island and there were
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.000]   200 total Powerstroke trucks on the island, he could probably develop a reputation as an expert
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.720]   in Powerstrokes, but he couldn't do what he's doing where he lives in Atlanta, where in Georgia,
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.040]   in rural Georgia, everybody and their mother drives a diesel pickup truck and majority of
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.600]   them are Fords. So you've got to actually have a market. But you can still look at your business
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.040]   and you can analyze outside of it. And you can look to say, "What is the core product that we're
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.240]   selling?" And then you look to say, "What are other products that we could sell?" Some businesses,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.120]   there are lines of continuity where you can sell warranty services, you can sell additional
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.480]   consulting services. Sometimes you can develop products. Sometimes in timber framing, if you have
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.800]   an expertise in timber framing, I'm sure you are aware of so many people are interested in learning
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.520]   timber framing. So perhaps you can take your expertise and you can develop that into teaching
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.000]   timber framing to others. And that may result in you traveling during the winter months and
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.120]   possibly doing timber framing workshops, possibly selling timber framing tools, possibly developing
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.920]   timber framing educational products to help people who want to do their own timber framing.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.640]   You're really good at building a pergola in the backyard using all hand tools with traditional
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.280]   200-year-old timber framing methodology, but now you sell and teach other people about that.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:57.040]   So whether it's products that you sell on your website, tools that you build and develop,
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.440]   instruction manuals, et cetera, you can look at a business like yours and try to figure out,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:07.200]   "Well, where are my opportunities for growth?" There's not a guarantee that you can do everything,
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.160]   but if you start looking at it and you start analyzing and saying, "Well, what can I do?
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:17.520]   What could I offer?" You may be able to find additional lines of revenue that you could add
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.880]   into your business. Go and look at something like PowerStroke Help and look at how somebody in a
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:29.360]   totally disconnected business is doing it. And then take your business and start looking around
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:36.160]   online, start talking to people and see what other people are doing on the subject of timber framing
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   and see if you have some ideas that would interest you enough to pursue. And if you'll start adding
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.640]   them and pursuing them, maybe it's you build some products that are shippable, maybe you do some
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:50.720]   furniture. In today's world where any individual can reach an international marketplace with a
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:57.040]   very low cost through the connectivity provided by the internet, we have a lot of opportunities.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.440]   And there's probably some ways that you can apply those to your particular industry.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.400]   Daniel in Texas, welcome. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.080]   Daniel T. Johnson, CEO, PowerStroke Health, Inc.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:11.200]   Thank you, Joshua, for taking all of our calls today. And good job. I haven't had the chance,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.160]   as I said earlier, as a beta subscriber to the career and income course, I haven't had the chance
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.840]   to look at the new stuff yet, but it's definitely helpful to begin with.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.080]   Well, thank you for being a beta member. I appreciate it.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.120]   Yeah, you're very welcome. Yeah, so I am currently a restaurant manager and
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.800]   especially for the restaurant business, I make good money. I have a pretty good schedule. I've
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:39.840]   gained seniority within the company, but I am pretty well tapped out for, I could move up in
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:46.800]   the company, but it would be require us to move, which we're not super excited about. And which
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:54.160]   we realize is a, I mean, that's a limiting factor. And we are as well, at best, I would make the same
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.840]   amount of money. I probably would even make less than I do now for the pleasure of running my own
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.400]   store. So that's not ideal. And I don't know how much you know about the restaurant business,
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:12.000]   but it is not, I mean, hours are typically very long. Money is not great.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.960]   Depending on what exactly you're doing, especially at a lower level, once you get to be a store GM,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.200]   you can make pretty good money. And I know people who make, as you were talking about the other day,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.600]   they get into that. I think it was the 5% percentile you're talking about making
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.520]   above $120,000. So that is certainly possible. So I'm trying to figure out
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:41.680]   about whether I seek to pursue something else in the restaurant business,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.960]   or I've kind of started playing around with learning to program. So something I've always
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.880]   kind of had an interest in, and certainly I think there's a big future in that just as we become
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   more and more technological. I've also got multiple side things I've kind of done, and as well,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.080]   trying to get into real estate investing. I actually have a couple investors lined up and
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:13.360]   I'm trying to do apartment multifamily investing, but it's just the market. I'm basically in Houston
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:19.040]   and the market everywhere is extremely challenging right now. So any thoughts,
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:26.880]   so the options are kind of, do I pursue something in the restaurant business and seek to,
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:35.680]   I've do my best to make the best job choice possible, but no, I might take some hits there
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   on the hours and such, but increase my income, or do I take the time to basically learn an entirely
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.960]   different skill such as programming, jump industries. And even my plan with that,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.720]   which I'm trying to figure out now is actually kind of create a website. Because there's not
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.120]   a whole lot of resources from, hey, here's someone who's actually gone from totally not
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:05.520]   in the industry to doing this, kind of create a blog or something to help other people walk that
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.760]   path. But, or just kind of stay with, I have a pretty good job, I make pretty good money,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.680]   it's better to develop this other side stuff. How much are you earning currently?
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.760]   I make about 70,000. And how much are your monthly living expenses?
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:33.120]   I mean, it depends on how you define it. I would say our hardcore living expenses are
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:40.240]   hard because I basically practice a $0 budget. So it's like, well, what does that mean?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:52.000]   I would say probably about 2800, give or take to 3000. And then the rest goes, I mean,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.680]   that's including putting money away for car repairs and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.920]   Tavish Leff: So if you had $3,000 a month of revenue, could your lights stay on,
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.160]   your rent get paid, and your family continue to eat?
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.360]   Michael O'Hanlon Yeah.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.360]   Tavish Leff: Okay. So that's important because it means you have tons of options.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.840]   That's very different than if your monthly living expenses were 8,000 a month,
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:18.480]   and you're constantly behind. So you've done a good job of planning and giving yourself options.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:24.480]   So now let's go to the careers. Do you have any reason why you want to stay in the restaurant
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.880]   business other than the fact that you know it, you're making money at it, and you can do it?
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.560]   Michael O'Hanlon Not really anymore. As everyone is,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.200]   I'm tired of the late nights, and I would like to spend more time with my family.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:44.880]   Tavish Leff: Right. So you asked what I know about the restaurant business. I don't know a lot.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.760]   I just wonder why anybody works in it, at least without owning a bunch of restaurants or without
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.560]   a passion for cooking. But it just seems to me like a meat grinder that's very difficult. I
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:59.600]   don't know how people make it. But I've always just assumed maybe there's something I don't know
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:05.440]   about. And I have learned, I think there are some people who like the schedule, but it is a hard one
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.080]   to handle. Michael O'Hanlon
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.040]   Yeah. I will just tell you, I think it is one of the industries, and I think more industries are
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.080]   more this way, but it's definitely one of the industries you can start as a dishwasher and end
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:22.240]   up being a GM. And I think that's where a lot of people, it's, "Well, I'm kind of trying to figure
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.520]   out what I want to do, but they offered me a job as an hourly manager." And you kind of work your
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:34.240]   way up, and it happens to be that you're 45, and you're working 75 hours a week and going home at
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.640]   2 a.m. That's just kind of what it is. Tavish Leff Right, right. That is a good point. And
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.000]   I remember I had a client one time who was an executive at McDonald's, and he had started as
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.880]   an entry-level McDonald's worker, and he had progressed through every stage, and he was a
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:56.960]   high-paid executive, and he was so grateful. He said, "I wouldn't have had a chance without
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.800]   McDonald's," but because of the McDonald's University and every stage along the way,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:06.400]   he was able to start with basically no skills and become a highly paid executive. So good point.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.000]   But for you, that's not the case because you have opportunities. So let's talk about
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:19.200]   the opportunities to move on. Just going between those two, as far as programming and real estate
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.640]   investing, does one of them excite you more? Are you more drawn to one or the other?
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:32.880]   Michael O'Hanlon Oh, I don't know. I've partially gotten to
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.240]   real estate investing because listening to you and other people, I realized that you have two
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:45.600]   ways to build wealth, and it's either make a lot of money and put the excess money into some form of
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:53.760]   stocks or bonds, ETFs, whatever, and let that money build and grow for you, or you do that
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.880]   through real estate. And that kind of seemed to be the two paths that people went.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.280]   And so I was like, "Well, at this point, I'm not expecting to have a super high-paying job. I mean,
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:13.440]   I'm putting money into my 401(k), so that will grow over time." But it's like, "Okay, I'm never...
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:22.400]   And especially, I mean, I'm 28 now, so when I "retire," who knows what even $1.5 million in
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:28.560]   my retirement account will do for me." So I chose real estate because it's like,
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.800]   "This is the reasonable path." It kind of excites me. I like it. The numbers of it excite me.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.320]   I'm also... I am very frustrated at this point now. I have chosen to give myself a fairly
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:50.720]   small pool of properties that I'm looking for, also kind of confirm those criteria with others,
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:56.880]   and they believe that is a good thing what I'm doing, that I'm looking at solid properties,
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.240]   and I want the numbers to be right, and I don't want to be driving three hours to go get them,
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:07.440]   etc., etc. So that just makes it so partially, it's like, at this point, it's frustrating for
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:16.240]   them like, "Okay, I'm kind of stuck. I'm sitting where I am. Maybe there's something else I can do
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:23.360]   that I can build my career and my income elsewhere while still pursuing real estate and building that,
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.240]   but kind of just also recognizing that the market's at a very high point. I don't know
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.600]   if I think it will or won't crash. Who knows? We'll see, but kind of waiting for things to
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.080]   do the right thing to pop up or things to cool down.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.400]   Right, right. Well, if you think about the difference between
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.720]   real estate and programming, I think they're two very different paths, and it wouldn't be
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.160]   right or wrong, but I think some very careful analysis on your part would be important as far
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:53:02.000]   as the vision that you have for your life. Do you have any experience in either of these industries
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:13.280]   yet? Not necessarily. I'm sufficient with computers. I mean, I have fairly good computer
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.000]   knowledge when it actually comes to programming. As I've told people, I know enough HTML just to
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.040]   break everything, so not really. I would say I almost have more experience in real estate
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.360]   because I've been learning about it longer, and we just bought our own house a couple years ago,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:34.480]   so I've become more intimately acquainted with all of that, dealing with that ridiculousness.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.560]   Right. Well, the reason I say I think they would go in two different directions,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.320]   so the problem you face with having a restaurant job, depending on your hours, etc.,
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.560]   is it's a job that demands you to be in a certain place at a certain time,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.280]   and one of the benefits of real estate, but one of the challenges of real estate,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.240]   is you don't necessarily have to be in a certain place at a certain time.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.960]   So in a way, if you're going to be putting together deals, you're going to be looking for
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   deals, etc., in a way, you need the ability to go when you need to go and be where you need to be
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:15.120]   when you need to be there, so you need a flexible lifestyle. Now, can programming deliver a flexible
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   lifestyle? I guess it could if you were an independent programmer. There are many people,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.840]   programming is such a wide range. There are mainstream programmers, and there are non-mainstream
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:28.320]   programmers. There are tons of people that work full-time on standard business hours for a company,
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:36.800]   and there are people who have a very diverse work schedule that it could integrate,
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:43.360]   but I would see those as kind of two different paths. With programming, you need to really
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:50.640]   invest in your skills, and those skills are going to be harder to invest into your particular
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.240]   industry. So with programming, your model is going to probably be more to earn a high income
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:04.480]   and then invest that money, and invest not based upon finding deals, but based upon the high income
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.560]   and the low expenses and enjoying the lifestyle of programming, if you enjoy the mathematical
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.240]   challenge. Most programmers pursue things, seem to pursue things, especially if they're really
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.160]   focused on wealth. They want to pursue something like being involved with an early-stage startup
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.200]   and building their equity, et cetera, and that's a possible world, but it's not an easy world.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.280]   So it's kind of its own thing, but I would guess that if you were pursuing that, it's hard for me
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.080]   to see how you would be served by trying to build a real estate investment business and a programming
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.440]   business at the same time. Now, with real estate, real estate has, if it's of interest to you,
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:45.200]   there are lots of well-proven ways to do it, and it sounds like you're already aggressively
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:49.920]   pursuing it. Now, question, do you have a lot of money that you can use now to pay for your own
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:57.120]   properties? I do not necessarily have any of my own. Like I said, I've got both through my father-in-law
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:02.000]   and then already just through basically talking to people, I've got at least one other investor
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.080]   lined up, so I have some money. Now, does your job currently give you the flexibility that you
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.240]   feel you need in order to pursue real estate and put some deals together? Yeah. So that's one of
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:21.440]   the advantages to my job is that I work, I mean, I do, I work about 50 hours a week, and I typically,
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:29.600]   we do breakfast. So most times I come in at five and I'm out by about two, and I've got,
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:34.880]   partially because I have seniority, I've got the flexibility in there to, so I'm like, "Hey,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.360]   can I have this day off?" or "Can I bug out a little early?" you know, whatever. So I do have
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:46.720]   that flexibility, and with being off by two, you know, yeah. Okay. Well, it's hard, so there are
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.920]   a couple ways in real estate. So if you have the benefit of having a stable income, that can be a
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.200]   really valuable resource for you, because you have enough money to provide for your needs,
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.880]   to provide for your family, and you have a stable source of income. So that can help you to be
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.400]   stable while you're trying to build your business. On the schedule that you described, it's also
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:14.080]   possible that you can build the business with that. Being done at two gives you, what, six hours
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:20.960]   that if you needed it, six hours to pursue putting things together. You have hours during business
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:27.040]   hours and you have hours in the evening. So that's a good way to advance, and you can integrate your
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.280]   family with some of your skills and possibly buy yourself a little bit more time to work
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.640]   because of the flexibility there. So I wouldn't run away from it, but I would seriously consider,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.480]   if you're not too excited about the restaurant business, I would seriously consider a transition
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:47.360]   plan. And I would look at real estate-related careers that you can work in while you are
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.480]   trying to build your real estate investment portfolio. And I would think that if you could
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.880]   be closer to the business, that could be a better move for you than being in the restaurant business.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:04.000]   If I were pursuing real estate and I was starting with nothing and I were flat broke,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.640]   I would try to get kind of a couple of jobs that are related to real estate as kind of my starting
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:18.160]   position. And I would try to see if I could get a job in managing real estate. So can I get a job
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.240]   as a building, what do they call it, the people who live in the building?
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.760]   - Property manager.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.440]   - Yeah, can I get a job, but like as a property manager where in exchange for some of my
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:33.600]   work, I actually get a discounted rent. That would be the one thing I would pursue. So that would
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:40.480]   lower my expenses and help me to learn what it's like to work as a property manager. I would pursue
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:47.520]   some business in it. So I would work for a company that does rental management. And you should be
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:53.200]   able to make easy. If you go work for a job for a company that manages real estate as a property
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:59:00.240]   manager, you should very easily be able to get a job making $50,000 a year that would provide
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.400]   enough to cover your income. And that would start to get you contacts and relationships
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:12.000]   with the particular business that you're pursuing. Always the obvious example is real estate,
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:18.480]   as a real estate agent, buying, selling properties, et cetera, or some specialist of that
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.120]   as well. Because now you have flexibility, you have the potential for high income,
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:29.920]   which can be helpful for you to build your own revenue and you have flexible schedule.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.880]   Frankly, that would be what I would pursue because there's no reason why you can't make
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:39.600]   six figures as a real estate agent. As you build the business, if you've got the financial ability
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.440]   to get started during the difficult years, you can make six figures as an agent. You can have
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.560]   a flexible work schedule. You can, along the way, build up a little management business if you want
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.040]   to as well. And you can develop cashflow, which you can use and you're in the business. So you'll
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:59.680]   see the deals. That's a time proven example. Or working with someone else that services the real
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:06.000]   estate industry. I guess I would see that if you have interest in it, I would see that as something
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.720]   seriously worth considering because it gets you closer to the business. You're more likely to find
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.240]   out about real estate deals in Houston, Texas. If you're working in the real estate industry in
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:23.680]   Houston, Texas, then if you're managing a breakfast cafe in Honolulu, Hawaii, I obviously changed your
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:29.520]   location just to prove the point, that the closer you are, the more likely you are to meet investors,
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.200]   the more likely you are to meet sources of capital, the more likely you are to come across
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.640]   deals. And if you want to be as an investor, you need deal flow and you need money flow.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.480]   And those are probably going to be served by you being closer to the business than in the
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.960]   restaurant business. So I wouldn't jump out, but I would seriously consider transitioning. And if
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.240]   you were convinced that that were the direction you wanted to go in, I think there's a lot of,
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.800]   it's a sensible path. -
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:04.000]   Okay. Yeah. And I had kind of asked some people who, one of the communities I'm part of that do
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.480]   real estate, like, well, should I try and pursue a job in the industry to help, you know, give me
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.920]   contacts or whatever. And they're like, eh, maybe, maybe not. It just depends. I think that was
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.640]   actually great of an idea. So, and frankly, being a real estate agent sounds absolutely terrible to
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.920]   me. So I probably would not go that route. But so you kind of see those as almost two,
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:38.080]   it'd be better to try and find a actual job in the industry that would pay me decently. And then I
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:49.440]   can, whatever, then trying to get an entirely different career path altogether, like going
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.040]   and doing programming. I mean, programming sounds interesting to me. So that's kind of why I was
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.520]   pursuing it. And I was like, well, maybe I can then develop a real estate on the side.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.120]   - I'm not trying to talk you into one or the other. So if you're interested in programming,
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.000]   go and pursue programming. And, but if you're programming, you're going to just buy a house
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.440]   every now and then as you accumulate money. How are you, unless you're the kind of person,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   say, I love both of these and I want to give half time to both of them. You could set up your life
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.600]   any way you want. If you can find a way to program four hours a day and do real estate four hours a
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:28.320]   day, hey, go for it. But I look at it and I say, what's the point of splitting your energy? Why
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:37.280]   not put 100% of your energy behind the most, the biggest opportunity? So many people kind of split
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.800]   their energy all over the place. Why wouldn't you, if you could work in the area where you want to
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.200]   invest, why wouldn't you take all of those benefits? When you look at rich people,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:56.000]   they don't usually come from a diverse background. What happens is you have to have those
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.520]   specialized skills and you have to develop a marketplace. So if you're going to build in
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.400]   programming, then if you're going to do programming, then go ahead and pursue it.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.880]   But then also make sure that your investment approaches are areas where your unique knowledge
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.920]   can be applied. So maybe you have a specialized knowledge in programming. And so now, is there
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.840]   a way that you can apply it to your investment plan, whether you're particularly interested in
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.240]   cryptocurrency or you're particularly interested in certain kinds of technology startups, or you
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.840]   really have your finger on the pulse of this certain thing that's happening. The obvious
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.400]   example is it's hard for you if you're living in Houston, Texas, it's hard to have your finger on
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.240]   the pulse of how real estate is doing in Bangor, Maine. It's possible to have your finger on the
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:50.320]   pulse of what's happening in Houston, Texas. So why not to build wealth? Why not structure those
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.960]   things as much as possible? So live in Houston, Texas, invest in Houston, Texas, work in Houston,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.000]   Texas. And if you get your living, your investing, and your working all in the same area,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.920]   now you start to have multiple benefits in all of them. You're known as a good investor.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.320]   You're also known as a good businessman in Houston, Texas. That builds your network. Your
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.400]   network in the area gives you access to more money. Your access to more money gives you access
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.040]   to more deals. It all starts to feed off of each other. But if half the time you're in Houston and
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.680]   half the time you're in metaphorical Bangor, Maine, now all of a sudden you have to work twice
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.560]   as hard in both places. So conceptually, that's my point. Pick what you think is your best option,
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.320]   and then try to grow, and then only add lines of business and investment as they relate to your
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.840]   particular approach. I love having a chicken in the background on my show. That's my kind of
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:48.640]   personal finance show. Yeah. Or we also have five acres. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Any
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.360]   other final question, Daniel, before I go? So I guess just a quick question with that. With
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.880]   certainly a peaking real estate market, whatever that exactly means, do you think
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.320]   certainly not knowing what's going to happen, who knows? It could go on another 20 years crazy. It
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.480]   could crash tomorrow. I mean, do you then potentially see as, okay, let's I go get a
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.200]   job as a real estate agent at a title company or whatever, and I'm trying to invest in real
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.920]   estate properties as am I putting too many eggs in one basket? Or is it kind of like, well, you
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.880]   ultimately never know what's going to happen. So you just go with, you make the best choices
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.640]   possible at the time with the information you have and do what you can. Yeah, it's possible.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:39.440]   And it is a risk. The most obvious risk that I often give advice on is if you work at a company
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:45.120]   and you invest all of your money in that company stock, what happens when the company goes bankrupt
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.840]   is you lose your whole life. So if you work at a company, don't necessarily invest in that company
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:55.040]   stock. So I don't think that you should get, I think it's risky for you to have everything in
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:01.280]   one area. It's risky for you to depend entirely on real estate if everything is dependent on a
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:08.080]   positive real estate market. So how do you manage the risk? Well, I don't have a perfect answer
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:13.280]   because most of us, we have a huge risk. For most people, if they lose their job, they're sunk.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.600]   Now, with your good financial planning in that you don't need a, you're a good budgeter, you
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.440]   don't need a huge amount of money to live on, you're more insulated. But still today, if you
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.880]   lose your income in the restaurant business, you could be sunk. And there's a connection between
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.760]   restaurants and real estate. If people aren't able to pay their mortgage, they're probably
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.600]   less likely to be spending money on restaurants. And so we always have these risks. So I look at
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.360]   it and say, I want to have my eyes wide open to the risks and try to protect myself. So I would
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.720]   try to say, first, let me make sure that I've got good financial planning in place for myself.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.280]   I've got cash in hand that I'm going to be insulated. If I lose my income for a few months,
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.760]   I need to make sure that I'm not going to be devastated by that. I would also look at my
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.640]   business and try to say, what are my backup plans? If the market turns, what are my backup plans?
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.720]   So if you think the real estate market is going to turn, then while you're building,
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.800]   working with buyers as an agent, by way of example, while you're working with buyers,
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.360]   start studying short sales so that you can become a short sale expert. I knew some real
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.760]   estate agents here locally in the last collapse of real estate in Florida where they made a huge
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.080]   amount of money. They never did better because they became short sale specialists. Same thing
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.920]   with investors. There are certain investment strategies that work in rising markets, and
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   there are certain strategies that work in falling markets. So a falling market may be a time where
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:42.960]   if you-- let's say you had work as an agent and an investor. As an agent, perhaps the falling
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.760]   market isn't serving you because people aren't buying houses so much and you're not interested
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.440]   in working in short sales. But if you have access to the capital, can you become a dealmaker? And
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.800]   now you start bird-dogging deals and flipping-- you're bringing properties under contract and
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.320]   you're assigning them over to wealthy people. And now you're taking advantage of the people
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.120]   who have more money and know deals, and you can do very well in a falling market because now
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:15.600]   you're able to do deals. So real estate is unique. It's cool in the sense that you can do well no
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.840]   matter the market. You just need a different strategy to do well in the market that you're
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.480]   dealt.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.400]   -Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:31.920]   -Beyond that, I would just say look at the actual business, look at the industry, look and try to
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.880]   decide what best fits my lifestyle. I'm more familiar with real estate than I am with
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.800]   programming, which is, I guess, why I started to talk more in that direction than about
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.880]   programming. But programming can be great. Just do your research and study it carefully. But
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.080]   most of all, try to build a life first, focus on the interest, and then you'll, over time, be
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.920]   able to build the income that you need. That's it for today's show. I hope that you've enjoyed
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.160]   this discussion of questions and answers. Obviously, I'm trying to do a couple things here.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.320]   I'm trying to create an interesting show that'll help you. If you don't have the money or it's
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.800]   not the right time for you to buy a course, then please just take the ideas that we're
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.800]   discussing in something like this and apply them to your own life. There was some gold here
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   in this show that you can take and apply to your own life. I gave you a bunch of resources.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.440]   Take them and run with them. That's why I do Radical Personal Finance. If you'd like more

[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:59.360]   calls. Most of today's callers, there were about three times as many that called in. For most of
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.640]   the callers, with the exception of Daniel there at the end, I didn't do any back and forth. We
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.800]   just gave one question. If you're interested in investing in a course like mine, come on by
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.160]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome. Try it for 30 days. I'll tell you this. I'm not offended
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.200]   at all by refunds. One of the great things about a business like I have chosen is that buying and
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.480]   refunding is relatively simple. If you try the course, you join us for the first few calls,
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.520]   start going through the modules. Ask me a question if you want to get a quick start and say, "Joshua,
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.120]   how can I go right to the module that'll be the most helpful to me?" I'll point you there.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.880]   Try it for 30 days. Go through it. If you, at the end of 30 days or before 30 days, decide,
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.160]   "Hey, this isn't for me," just shoot me a note. Say, "Joshua, would you like a refund?" I punch
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.480]   a couple of buttons and boom, it's done. It's a lot easier than sending books back to Amazon
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.120]   and paying return shipping. I'd love for you to join up to sign up. If you think it's of all
