[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, it's never a bad time to soak in the glorious truths of
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Psalm 16, and that's what we're going to do today in a clip from
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   2015. This clip comes from a memorable sermon titled
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "The Path to Full and Lasting Pleasure." The clip begins
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   where the sermon begins, with John Piper walking out on stage
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   at a Shane and Shane conference. There, Pastor John recited
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Psalm 16 from heart. This text and this
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   sermon was fresh on his heart, coming in light of pretty deep
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   sorrow for the Bethlehem community, as you will hear in a moment, making
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   for a clip and for a sermon, and for an event that has
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   impacted many of you, I know. Without any further introduction,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   here's Pastor John reciting Psalm 16.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Preserve me, O God, for in you
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I take refuge. I say to the Lord, "You are my Lord. I have no good
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   apart from you." As for the saints in the land,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   they are the noble in whom is all my delight.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Those who choose another god multiply their sorrows.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Their libations of blood I will not pour out
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   or take their names upon my lips. The Lord is
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   my chosen portion and my cup. You hold
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   my lot. The lines have fallen for me in
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   pleasant places. Indeed, I have a beautiful
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   inheritance. I bless the Lord who gives me
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   counsel. In the night also my heart instructs me.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Because you are right at my right hand, I shall not
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   be moved. Therefore, my heart is
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   glad and my soul rejoices, and my whole body dwells
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   secure. For you do not give me up to shield or let your
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   godly ones see the pit. You show me the path of life.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I want you to open it to Psalm 16,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   which I just recited. Let me set the table for you
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   before I pray and ask God to come and do mighty things among us.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And the reason I feel an anticipation that he's going to do remarkable
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   things is because the way he has set up this evening.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So two weeks ago, I was in the Boundary Waters in northern
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Minnesota fishing with my son and
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   six others. And one of those others was
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   a 20-year colleague whom I love, who has
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   been the worship leader at our church for 20 years.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   When we got back to the Outfitters, he was to call home and the
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   phone call was that his son had died
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   at 22 without the slightest
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   history of trouble. He was in northern Ireland
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   doing a mission trip and simply
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   fell over. And with his sister at his side
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   met Jesus. The funeral
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   was last Friday, four days ago. And
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   little did we know that Alex, before
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   he had left for northern Ireland, had told his small group
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   what he wanted in his funeral. He didn't think
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   he was going to die, but he said
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   here are the songs. We sang all the songs that he chose and here's the
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   text that I want. Psalm 16.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's the psalm that I was asked to speak on months ago at this
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   event. And so last Friday, in front of about a thousand
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   young people mainly, I was
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   doing what I just did, praying over these
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   people's Psalm 16. And now I'm here speaking to
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   several thousand people, not too much older probably than
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Alex. Psalm 16.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And in my judgment, God is
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   setting that up to burden me for you
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   in a way that he wouldn't
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   or couldn't any other way.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You have no idea whether you will live out this week.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   None. He had no history
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   whatsoever. And to this moment, we do not know why he died.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So Lord, I believe this is a divine appointment
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   for many. Whether it be the case that some here
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   will not live out the week or whether they will live 60 more years.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's a divine appointment and the weight I feel
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   for this psalm to come to reality in their lives is very great.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And so I invite you, Holy Spirit, to come. In the name
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of Jesus, I plead with you to come. Don't leave me to my
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   resources. I look away from myself and
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I ask that these friends would do the same. May they look away from themselves
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and all their performances
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and look wholly to you
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to speak to them now. So that
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   what David is and sees
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   in this psalm, they would be and see and feel.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I ask this in Jesus'
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   powerful name. Amen. Let me give you the
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   main point as I understand it in one sentence.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I'm going to try to sum up the main point of all 11 verses
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   in one sentence. It goes like this.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   God will bring you
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   body and soul
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   through life and death into
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   full and everlasting pleasure
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   if God is your
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   safest refuge and your sovereign Lord
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and your supreme treasure
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and your trusted counselor.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I know it's a long sentence.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So I'm going to say it again and then we're going to move through the entire psalm
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   verse by verse and you will watch for whether I'm
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   right to sum it up this
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   way. It goes like this. God
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   will bring you body and
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   soul through life
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and death into full
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and everlasting pleasure
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   if God is
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   for you your safest refuge,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   your supreme treasure,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   your sovereign Lord
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and your trusted counselor.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And so if he's not, my prayer is that
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   as God speaks through this psalm he would become
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   that for you. A few of you who really
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   know your Bible well might hear that summary
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   in one sentence and say to me, "Are you going to
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   take into account what
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   the apostle Peter over in Acts
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   chapter 2 in the New Testament makes of this psalm?"
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Because Peter says
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   that verses 9 to 11 are a
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   prophecy of the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And you didn't mention that
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   in your main point. Why not?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Because that's the one thing he picked out of the psalm
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   to mention. And my answer is
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   number one, yes I am going to deal with what
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Peter makes of this psalm in Acts 2.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And number two, the reason I don't
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   say that the resurrection of Jesus is part of the main
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   point of this psalm is because I don't think it is.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But rather is a massive
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and unshakable argument for the main
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   point of the psalm. And if that sounds strange
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   to you, that something is massive and unshakable
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and great and glorious as the resurrection
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   of the Son of God from the dead should be an argument
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   under a main point supporting it,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   just know this, that one of the great and amazing
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and wonderful things about the Bible is that
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   again and again and again, glorious
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   things, massive, unshakable,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   beautiful, awesome realities are made
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   to serve practical, personal
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   main points in texts. That's amazing
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and that's true all over the Bible. So yes,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   we will get to Peter's application
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   of verses 9 to 11 in the resurrection and we will discover
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   it is not the main point of this text. The main point
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   of this text is that God will bring you
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   body and soul through death into full
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and everlasting pleasure if he is your
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   treasure and refuge and sovereign
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and counselor. That's the main point.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Powerful. And that's just the start of the sermon. The whole sermon is great.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's available online. As always, it's titled "The Path to Full and
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Lasting Pleasure," preached on August 14, 2015
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   at a Shane and Shane conference. The sermon has been suggested
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   several times to us for a clip on APJ. This particular clip comes from Alan
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in Little Rock, Arkansas. Alan writes, "Thank you so much for this podcast and
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   answering your questions and giving us sermon clips. I first listened to this
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   sermon in 2015 and it was one of the first John Piper sermons I had checked
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   out. I'd recently moved to a new state to help plant a church in Wisconsin
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and I started a new job that allowed me to listen to music and sermons while I worked.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I hit play on this one and heard John Piper recite Psalm 16 from memory.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I was amazed that someone would do that. So I did it.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   All of Psalm 16 and have continued to recite it into my life
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   for the past six years. God has done amazing things for me and my family
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   through that one Psalm. Thank you, Pastor John, for this model."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Thank you, Alan. That's a great story. Many of our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermon has changed your life or impacted you and we share that clip
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   with the APJ audience. If you've got one, email me. Give me your name, hometown,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the sermon title, and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio file
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and tell me how it impacted you. Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's our email address.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, the divided heart is a natural
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   experience in the Christian life. The heart, even the heart of the believer,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   puts up resistance against God.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   How to overcome this divided heart is worth some reflection
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and that's what we're going to do next time. I'm your host, Tony Rehnke. I'll be rejoined
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   in the studio with Pastor John on Friday for that, talking about the
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   divided heart. We'll see you then.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   [Silence]
