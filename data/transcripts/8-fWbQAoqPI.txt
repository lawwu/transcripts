[00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.220]   So let's take all of this theory and let's put it into practice.
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.320]   Let's talk about a product, Granola.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.560]   Just by a raise of hands, how many people have either tried or
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   used Granola today?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.560]   What they realize is actually there's a whole other set of customer needs
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.080]   that have been unmet, which is, I don't want you to take all of my notes.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.480]   I just want you to help me take better notes,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.560]   empower me around this specific task and user.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.960]   And that's what they built the product around.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.280]   Now, because the realization is that you can't stop here.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.120]   You can't stop by just assembling your initial set of Lego bricks.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.460]   You have to sequence over and over again.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.760]   You have to take those first three Lego bricks,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.140]   leverage them into another unique set that you assemble.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.940]   And you see Granola doing this.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.280]   Now that they've enabled this, they've started to create project and
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.840]   team workspaces and start to enable a new set.
