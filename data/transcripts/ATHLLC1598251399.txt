[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there is.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   But all this research takes time and there are only so many hours in the day.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.720]   So today I'm so excited to be talking to Laura Vanderkam, who helps people spend
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.040]   more time on what matters and less on what doesn't.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   She's the author of several time management and productivity books,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.880]   including What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast and 168 Hours.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   Her work has appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fast
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   Company, and Fortune.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680]   She hosts two podcasts, Before Breakfast and Best of Both Worlds, and blogs at
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.760]   lauravanderkam.com.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.880]   I have no idea how anyone could have time for all that, and she has five
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   children, but that's exactly why we're here today.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.280]   Laura, thank you for being here.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.600]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   I just wanted to kick this off and ask, like, what is the biggest
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.960]   misconception you think people have about time management?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.880]   Well, that it's about doing more with your time.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.000]   Many people are interested in hacks, as why we listen to a podcast like this,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   where, you know, we're going to save time by, I don't know, cleaning the
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   shower while we're in it or soaking our pasta before we boil it so it takes less
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.360]   time to boil, or sending emails where instead of saying, OK, you just write
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.520]   K because we feel like we are somehow more efficient when we don't use the
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.480]   letter O. And that's fine.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.600]   I mean, there's no point in spending more time on things than we need to.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.360]   But fundamentally, time management is about using the time we have to build
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.760]   the lives we want.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.720]   And sometimes that is about being very efficient with things and getting
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.280]   through quickly.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.520]   And sometimes it's about throwing gobs of time against something because it's
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   what you really want to do.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.280]   Yeah, one of the things that stood out to me, I had a chance to read a couple
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.960]   of your books.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.000]   You've written a lot, so I apologize.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.080]   I didn't get to all of them yet.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.400]   But in every single one, you emphasize that when people say they don't have
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   time, it's not really true.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.000]   They have time.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.840]   It's just not necessarily a priority.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.000]   And you emphasize a lot that people actually have 168 hours every week, which
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.400]   leaves them with somewhere between 60 and 70 non-waking, non-work hours,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.640]   depending on how much they work.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.320]   And so I'm curious, when you talk to people about how much time they have, how
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.160]   do you suggest people start to get started just thinking about what that
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.200]   means in their own life?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.240]   Yeah, well, first, switching to that 168-hour perspective is huge for most
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   people. We are accustomed to thinking in life in terms of days, which is 24
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.440]   hours. But in fact, you live life in weeks.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   So that's 24 times 7, or 168 hours, which is, by the way, a number I didn't
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.840]   know until I multiplied it through and I started writing about this.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.920]   I don't know why we don't know that number, but that's the number of hours
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.360]   in a week. And the reason this is important, I mean, it gives us a more
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.160]   complete picture of our time.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.840]   Like, is Tuesday a normal day for you or Saturday a normal day for you?
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.920]   They both occur just as often, and they both have the exact same number of
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.880]   hours. But many people spend them very differently.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   And if we only look at one of them, then we have a misleading perception of
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.120]   time. So thinking about 168 hours gets rid of that issue and also just shows
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.720]   us how much time we have.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.040]   Like you said, if you are working a 40-hour-a-week full-time job, so
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.160]   standard full-time hours, if you are sleeping 8 hours a night, which is 56
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.480]   hours per week, that leaves 72 hours for other things, which is quite a bit
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.800]   of time. And obviously, people have different levels of responsibility within
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.960]   that 72 hours.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.040]   I mean, some people have nothing else they need to do within that.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.080]   Some people have more intense caregiving responsibilities, for instance, which
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.000]   can certainly take a lot of that time.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.760]   But one way or the other, I have not seen anyone's schedule where they don't
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.360]   have some discretionary time.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.840]   Maybe it's not as much as we want, but it is some.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   And when we have that perspective that we probably have some, then we can
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.720]   change our narrative from I have no free time whatsoever.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.880]   I have no time for anything.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.080]   I'm a victim of circumstance, too.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.760]   I have some amount of time that I have autonomy over.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.200]   What would I like to do with it?
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.320]   What kind of life would I like to create within this time that I have?
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.160]   Yeah, I can't imagine anyone listening says, OK, I have all this time.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.720]   I want to change that narrative or I don't want to change that narrative.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.080]   What is the kind of first step to start changing that narrative?
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.840]   Well, I am a big believer in actually tracking our time, which before your
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.320]   listeners flee, is really in keeping with the whole life hacking mindset.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   You know, we want to know the data so we can make the best of it.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.040]   So I have actually been tracking my time on weekly spreadsheets for six years.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.680]   You do not have to do that.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.040]   Nobody has to do that.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.520]   I'm a bit of a time management freak, but I do think it is helpful to try
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.440]   tracking your time for one week.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   See where the time really goes.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   Many people are quite surprised about where the time goes, because again, if
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.760]   you don't know there are 168 hours in a week, it is very hard to figure out the
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.880]   proportions. I mean, you don't know the denominator.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.200]   So we're just kind of flying blind.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.040]   If you get paid by the hour, you know how many hours you work.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.400]   If you don't get paid by the hour, this can be a far more nebulous concept.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.080]   And people put all sorts of numbers on it that are more based on how they feel
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.480]   about their work than the actual usual hours.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.680]   Same thing with sleep.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.360]   If we feel tired, we tend to put a low number on it as opposed to actually
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.720]   tracking it. If we feel like we don't have a lot of free time, we'll decide we
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   have zero or have very little amount.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.600]   And then you track and say, well, oh, I do have some.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.240]   Maybe it's like two hours after my young kids go to bed and before I do.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.320]   But because we're not thinking in that mindset, we don't see that it's there.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   And when we tell ourselves we have no time, then we don't think about what we
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   want to do with it. We spend it in effortless ways.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.920]   So try tracking your time for a week.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.360]   I promise it will be worthwhile.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.960]   You will discover interesting things and then you can decide what you want to do
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.720]   with that data.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.360]   Yeah, and I assume if you've tracked your time for six years, you found that there
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.480]   isn't an app that's better than a spreadsheet, it sounds like spreadsheet is
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.960]   just the easiest, simplest way.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   You know, I think there are probably different schools of thought on this.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.680]   There are definitely a lot of time tracking apps on the market.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.800]   And if any of your listeners are particularly into apps or think it would be
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   more straightforward or easy for them to stick with it with an app, then by all
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.120]   means use that. I like the spreadsheets because it forces me to account for my
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.400]   time, like I actually have to write it down.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.120]   Similar in the way people who are into budgeting, for instance, often like to
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.400]   manually track their spending so they know where it goes.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.040]   It also serves as a diary because I'm writing what I'm doing.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.520]   And so there's a little space for narrative there as I write things.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.400]   And I also don't have to be quite as good about what category does this fall into
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.920]   because my spreadsheets are a bit less exact than I think an app would force you
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.280]   to be in terms of categorizing because the app wants to make a pie chart out of
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.560]   your time. And so all your categories have to be mutually exclusive and
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.880]   comprehensively exhaustive.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.160]   And on my spreadsheet, if I'm just manually adding things up, I don't have to
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.440]   do that.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yeah. And what are the most common things you think people find as things that they
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.360]   need to get rid of or things that are wasting their time?
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.040]   Well, I think the biggest thing that wastes time is just being mindless about
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.640]   it, not thinking about how we would like to spend our time.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.560]   And so when we do have time that could be discretionary, we are not prepared to
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.600]   seize it. So as an example, if you don't think about what you want to do on the
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.560]   weekend, like you'll sit there on Saturday morning sort of hemming and hawing,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.840]   you're like, oh, I don't know what I want to do.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   What does everyone else want to do?
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.680]   If you're with another group of people, if you have a family or other people you
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.200]   might spend weekends with, you don't get started on this decision until midday.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.880]   And then half the time you could have used for something on Saturday is already
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.920]   gone. So many of the things that you could have chosen are not there.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.720]   Or you had this time from the morning until midday that could have been devoted to
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   something really fun that if you'd thought about it ahead of time and had the
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   logistics in place to do it.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.640]   And so that's what winds up happening to people or at the end of the day,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.280]   particularly if any of your listeners have jobs and young kids, a lot of your
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   during the week leisure time will occur at night, right after young kids go to
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.720]   bed. And so like it could be a reasonable amount of time.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.960]   It could be, you know, 90 minutes, two hours.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.640]   But if you're not really thinking of it as I have this chunk of time, I can choose
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.880]   to do something that I want to with this time.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   Then you'll just start scrolling around online or like resorting the mail pile or
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.200]   puttering around the house or doing nothing of any interest to you.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.640]   Really, it's not really relaxing you.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.720]   It's not rejuvenating you.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.680]   It's not what you would have chosen if you'd actually thought about like, hey, I
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.880]   have two hours.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.800]   I don't have child care responsibilities.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.080]   I have this as leisure time.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.440]   What would I like to do?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.160]   So being mindful allows you to seize the time that is there.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.120]   And if we think about how we'd like to spend our time, we vastly increase the
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.560]   chances that we use it for things that are meaningful to us.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.080]   Yeah, do you think it's more helpful to start with, OK, so I've time tracked a
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.320]   week and I've looked at everything in the account or in the calendar, the
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.200]   spreadsheet. Do I start with what are the things that are meaningless and remove
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.440]   them? Or do I start with what are the things that I should prioritize?
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.840]   I actually think you should start with that question of what you want to spend
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.960]   more time doing in your life.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:28.600]   And that is because it, you know, when we fill our lives with the stuff that we
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.000]   want to have there, everything else just naturally takes less time.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.360]   I mean, we can spend all sorts of time coming up with these hacks of like
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.160]   sending our emails that say K instead of OK, right, to save a few minutes.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.440]   But then, you know, what are you doing with that time?
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   Whereas if you have a project at work that you are so excited about and that you
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.840]   have put big chunks of time into your work schedule to work on, like you are
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.680]   naturally sending fewer stupid emails because you don't want to like you don't
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.120]   want to devote the time to it.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.040]   You have other things that have a bigger claim on your time that you really want
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.120]   to do. Same thing in our personal life.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.200]   I mean, there's all sorts of hacks to spend less time on housework to do it more
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.120]   efficiently. But if you are, you know, meeting with your bowling league every
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.280]   Tuesday night and going out and doing that, like you're not going to be
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.640]   spending all that time puttering around the house, randomly cleaning stuff up
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.560]   that just gets dirty again five minutes later because you have something that's
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080]   worthwhile and enjoyable to you.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.480]   And so everything else fills in around the craps.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.640]   Yeah, I think we have a 10 month old and we have an au pair and she ends her day
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   at 530 and I'm like so efficient to be done at 530 in a way that I feel like I
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.480]   would would have spilled over till 630.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.200]   So you phrased it in the book, Create a Life So Exciting.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.920]   You want to work faster at some point.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.560]   And I've seen that come to life.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   So what are the things that you think people get the most value from
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.400]   prioritizing?
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.800]   Well, I think there are three main categories that I kind of put priorities
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.200]   into that I find many people find helpful.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.880]   Obviously, there's the professional stuff.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.840]   So your career, hopefully something that you find exciting and meaningful that
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.720]   how you're making this big impact on the world relationships.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   So that would be your family and friends and the things that you wish to
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.320]   prioritize in building those relationships and making them stronger.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.520]   And then finally, in the category of self.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.240]   So those are the things that are enjoyable for you, nurturing your health,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.920]   maintaining energy, your spiritual development or any hobbies that you wish
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.880]   to do. So those three categories tend to be the ones that are most worth
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.800]   prioritizing.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.280]   And the one kind of small thing you mentioned in the book was that exercise
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.000]   kind of which falls into that third category of prioritizing yourself can
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.320]   actually sometimes make time.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.680]   Yeah, I really think that sleep and exercise don't take time so much as they
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   do make time, because whatever time you devote to those things within reason is
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.920]   going to be paid back to you in terms of more energy, better focus.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.880]   Whereas if you deliberately skimp on those things, thinking that you are going
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.000]   to save time somehow, I think we have all had the experience.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.720]   I mean, particularly if you have a 10 month old, I mean, if you had a bad
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   night, everything takes longer the next day.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:27.320]   Like you just don't have the resources to get through hard stuff when you are
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.920]   tired. And it's not that you did something wrong.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.120]   It's just that that's the nature of of the energy where people be like, oh,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.040]   yeah, I'm going to work hard, work through lunch.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.160]   I'm at my desk all day.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.320]   You know, I'll get through everything.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.120]   I mean, yes, we want to be efficient, but you don't get up and move or anything
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.400]   like that. Don't take any breaks.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   And come to thirty three o'clock in the afternoon, you're reading the same email
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   six times in a row, like you're following a link in there.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.680]   Next thing you know, you didn't mean to me, but you're somewhere on social media
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.480]   lost, like reading headlines about stuff you totally didn't mean to or looking at
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.520]   photos of people you didn't like in high school anyway.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.480]   And all this time can disappear because you needed a break and you didn't take a
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.720]   break. So it's far better to decide, like, I'm going to go for a brisk walk at two
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.080]   o'clock in the afternoon, come back, you can actually focus.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.840]   So that 30 minutes was technically not working.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.640]   But if you are able to work much more efficiently afterwards, then you didn't lose
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   time in the process.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.000]   And do you think people should schedule those breaks or just kind of be try to be
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.320]   aware that they need to happen?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.720]   It depends what kind of job you have.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.800]   If you have a very flexible job where you don't have a whole lot of scheduled
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.160]   commitments, then sure, do it whenever you really notice yourself getting into that
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.760]   moment of being low energy and needing some sort of break.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.320]   On the other hand, you know, if you have different patients you're seeing every 20
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.960]   minutes, obviously you're going to have to be more proactive about scheduling that in
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.680]   in order to have that break whenever that would be possible within your schedule.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:03.080]   And so I tried to go through a lot of these exercises in advance of speaking with you
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.640]   because I thought it'd be helpful. And I thought about, OK, career, family, yourself.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   And then I thought, what about all these things that we all have on our kind of to do
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.880]   list, if you will, like I need to go to the DMV sometime before my license expires.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.040]   I want to organize the garage, things that never seem to be a priority that I want to
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.520]   do now, but I know sometimes have to happen.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.760]   How do how do people how should people kind of think about prioritizing them and when
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.640]   to do them? They feel like they always just get pushed off.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.960]   Yeah, well, I mean, these are things that you can, in fact, put on your to do list.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.680]   I suggest people as much as possible try to batch things like that and put them all on
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.920]   a certain day, a certain chunk of hours, because then it forces prioritization within
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   that. Right. Like if you have all weekend to run errands, like it can take all weekend
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.080]   to run your errands. Whereas if you say, OK, I had to get everything done in this two
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.680]   hour block, two and a half hour block, whatever it is you wanted to vote to it, you
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.200]   will be more efficient within that time or within cleaning your house.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   Same thing if you say, OK, we're going to clean this whole thing in 90 minutes.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   Everyone's focused on it.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   Everyone's doing it. We're going to get it done.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.600]   And then the upside of that, too, is not only does it force efficiency within that,
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   like if you find yourself looking at a dirty floor at some other point, you don't have
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.280]   to be like, oh, I should go do that instead of whatever I'm doing right now and be like,
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.200]   oh, yeah, there's a time for cleaning the floor now is not that time.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.360]   Right. And that allows us to relax.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.480]   So whenever we can batch things, it forces the prioritization within the batched window
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.040]   and then also allows our brains to relax and let go of that constant loop of I should
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.560]   be doing X. That keeps us from relaxing.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.440]   It keeps us from focusing on things that we have chosen to do during any given time
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.960]   because, yeah, you know, there's a time to go to the DMV.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.400]   You've set it up. It's for, you know, Friday morning.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.360]   You're going to do all these things and that's when you're going to go.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.720]   And now it's not Friday morning, so I can stop thinking about it.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.040]   So a lot of the things we've been talking about take a good portion of your time.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.680]   But what about when you just have three to five minutes, whether a meeting ends early or
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.760]   you're waiting in line, is there anything you can do with that time to make it more
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.480]   productive? I think you should use that time to read.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.080]   I mean, most of us pick up our phones and check email or scroll through social media or
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.040]   check headlines in those little bits of time.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.560]   And it makes sense because our phones are there.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.040]   They are convenient. These are things we can interact with in short and uncertain amounts
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   of time. But there are other things you can do, too.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.280]   If you have an e-reader app on your phone and put e-books on your phone, then you can
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.800]   use those little bits of time to read.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.760]   Now, you may not want to choose, like, the most gripping novel ever for five minutes of
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.400]   time because then you'll be very, very sad when the person calls you and you're like,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.800]   "Darn it, I have to put it down." But like a lot of nonfiction, for instance, could be
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.480]   read in those small chunks of time, and those small chunks of time really add up.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.880]   It is not at all unusual for people to have 30 minutes of these small chunks of time
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.080]   through the day. And hey, if you use that to read, that's 30 more minutes of reading you
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.920]   get done per day. That's, you know, 210 minutes a week, which is three and a half hours.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.440]   And that's a lot. Like you could be getting through an extra book a week in that amount of
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.960]   time. So consider doing that with your little bits of time instead.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.240]   What about people? So you talked about family and relationships.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:29.560]   I find that sometimes people can turn into, at least for me, what I'll call the human
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.880]   version of email, where you can meet up with someone and next thing you know, you're
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.440]   talking for four hours.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.280]   And it's not that I don't want to spend time with people.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.120]   It's not that I don't want to build these relationships.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.880]   But there's also only 168 hours in a week.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.520]   And, you know, I may only want to prioritize an hour of spending time with someone, but
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.200]   it just always ends up falling into three hours to do dinner or go out for drinks or
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.280]   have someone over. Do you have any kind of tips for keeping relationships strong but
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   not throwing, you know, the whole week into it?
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.960]   Yeah, well, I mean, if you have people like that, that you do want to see, but you want
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.440]   to limit the time, your best bet is coming up with stuff that is more naturally limited.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.560]   So, you know, you meet the person for a walk.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.600]   You probably aren't going to walk for three hours.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.160]   Like, it's just, you know, we're going to do this loop around this lake, which is two
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.680]   miles. When we are done with the two miles, we are, in fact, done.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.520]   And so that is something that might more naturally limit it.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.600]   Or if you know you have a scheduled commitment afterwards, you can be very clear about
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.520]   this. Be like, hey, you know, as we're we're talking, I wanted to make sure I caught up
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.320]   with you. Just, you know, by the way, I said I'd have to call my mom at whatever
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.480]   time, just so you know.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.600]   But anyway, it's something that, you know, there is an end to it because I think that's
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.480]   totally fine. There's certainly people that we want to spend time with.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.560]   We don't want to spend all our time with.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.960]   And if it gets to that, then you can sort of say, you know, I'm willing to spend within
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.040]   this window, like five minutes to 60 minutes.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.440]   That is the upper limit.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.560]   We will always end it around that time.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.960]   You know, and as long as you're nice about it, I think people are going to roll with
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.280]   it, especially if it seems like there's a real circumstance that is ending it.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.040]   It's not like, yeah, I've had enough of you.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   Yeah. And one of the quotes that was probably it might be my favorite quote was it can
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.720]   take hours to buy back the goodwill burned in a two second glance at your phone while
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.320]   someone's trying to tell you something important.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.560]   Yeah. And my takeaway from that quote kind of ties in here, which was.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.720]   If you know that you're spending 30 minutes with someone and you've said, look, this is
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.840]   the time I've decided I want to spend with you, it kind of makes it more easy to say,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.600]   I want to be here.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.520]   I'm going to be present.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.800]   I'm going to turn everything else off because I've prioritized it versus get a random
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.520]   phone call, answer the phone call while you're cleaning the house.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   Now you're like in the middle of one activity trying to do another.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.360]   It's probably not even the most productive hour on either task at hand, talking to the
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.560]   friend or cleaning the house.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.880]   So I know that quote really stuck with me as as a inspiration for when you are doing
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.360]   something, just focus on that.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.920]   Yeah. I would also say because, you know, people may want to do that, but what often
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.560]   happens is like, what time is it?
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.000]   Because they do have something they have to do afterwards.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   And and so one thing you can do is set alarms.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.640]   And I've seen my husband do this for like business situations.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.080]   Like if he's talking to a client, he wants the person to feel like he is fully focused
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.440]   on them. But, you know, he has to leave to catch a train or something.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.280]   So he has an old fashioned like watch, like a digital wristwatch, and he sets an alarm
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.640]   for like, you know, if the meeting was at two and he has to leave at three, it's like
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.720]   two fifty five, it goes off.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.760]   So he's totally relaxed until two fifty five when that alarm goes off, which sounds like
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.800]   something totally separate.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.680]   You know, it wasn't him. He didn't do anything.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.720]   He wasn't looking at the clock to see what time it was.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.800]   So that's something you can do so that, you know, you won't have to think about it.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.400]   You won't have to sneak glances at your phone or something else when you're talking to
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.760]   the person. And yet, you know, it will be stopped when you need to stop.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.080]   Yeah, mine is I've turned off all vibrations for notifications and messages and
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.920]   anything. So, you know, I don't someone told me, oh, just turn off, turn your phone in
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.400]   airplane mode, turn it off.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.360]   You don't see the screen.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.640]   Well, that means that if there's something that you need to check, it's like a big
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:24.360]   hassle. But if you could turn off all the vibrations, all the noise, then your phone
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   could sit in your pocket. It might as well be on airplane mode as far as you're
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.920]   concerned until you take it out.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   But there is nothing more frustrating than trying to be present.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.480]   And then it's like it's usually nothing.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.680]   I mean, it's like the group text from the people that always are group texting.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   Exactly. It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.880]   start to emerge.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.360]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.920]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.960]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.160]   Thirty seven thousand, twenty five, one.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.560]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.040]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.440]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.840]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.000]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.480]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.920]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.160]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.440]   year old tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.680]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.560]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.720]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:55.040]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.200]   They have so many products but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh for
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.840]   mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.920]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.760]   things to drink.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.880]   And if you need another reason search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.800]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more and then be happy that
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.960]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.480]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free U.S.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.320]   shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.120]   And for a limited time you can get up to 15 percent off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:43.200]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.760]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.880]   That kind of comes back to this idea of trying to do two things at once.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.760]   Do you have a stance from all of the kind of studying you've done people you've talked to
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.080]   whether people can productively multitask and do email during a meeting or have a
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   conversation while they clean the house or what's your stance there?
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:13.360]   So in general you can't do two related things at the same time if they're using kind of
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.040]   the same part of your brain.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.560]   It will be very inefficient.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.600]   You'll just wind up switching back and forth between the two.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.560]   So if you can check email while you're in a meeting like why are you in that meeting?
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   Like clearly you're not that needed in that meeting if it is possible for you to do this.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.800]   So it would have been better on the front end to be like I don't need to be here or I only
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.040]   need to be here for the first 15 minutes or something like that rather than waste the
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.600]   time of acting like you're in two places at once.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.120]   So that's for that.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.480]   Now on the other hand some things it doesn't really matter for all that efficient.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:54.560]   Like if you don't particularly care if you do the world's best job folding laundry and it
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.720]   would make it more pleasant to talk to a relative on the phone while you're doing it like
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.360]   that sounds great.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.920]   Like that's a great way to multitask because yeah it doesn't matter what your towels look
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.760]   like you're not trying to go for the hotel crease in the in the in the towel folding.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.200]   So by all means make it more pleasant.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.440]   Or you know there's also ways we can kind of deepen our time by combining things usually
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.360]   something that you are intending to do anyway and bringing another person into it.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.400]   So exercising with a friend for instance is a great way to nurture a relationship while
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.840]   also you know nurturing your health or running an errand with a kid like if you have
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.400]   multiple kids taking one on an errand is a great way to spend some one on one time
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.000]   together.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.040]   So yeah these are just ways that you can do things with another person and so you are in
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:48.240]   fact multitasking but in a much better way than being in an email and being in an email
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.280]   haha being in a meeting and checking email at the same time.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.480]   Sometimes I feel like I'm in an email all the time all the time.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.800]   One one one tip I have for multitasking with a partner is make sure you're on the same
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.120]   page about how devoted you might be to a certain activity.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.000]   I think for me I if I watch a television show for me I'm like I want to be all in I don't
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   want to miss anything like I it's just really engaging and sometimes my wife is like I
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.080]   just want to have a show on and if I miss a piece of the show it's not a big deal.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   So she's fine if she sends a text to her family and it would drive me nuts because I was
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.320]   like no why aren't we paying attention and then I was like oh you're not trying to have
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.960]   the same experience with the television as I am and I think that's helped a bit though I
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.400]   still have these it's still tough but it's helped to say what are we doing together what
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.200]   are we trying to achieve make sure we're on the same page about what we want before kind
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.280]   of maybe judging what someone else is doing.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.640]   So that's something that I'm continuing to work on but I think what was helpful was
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.720]   understanding what people were trying to get out of an experience before.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.520]   Yeah I mean although in general I don't know I feel like if you're watching something for
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.440]   entertainment value I mean I'm kind of with you like you may as well get the full
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.760]   enjoyment of it whereas if the goal was spending time with you which is why she's
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.560]   sitting next to you then maybe watching a show together isn't the best way to do that.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.840]   Like maybe you two should be interacting and so being clear on what that time is and
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.080]   why you are spending it doing what you're doing is in general a good idea.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.000]   I mean yeah you want to be good about communicating these things.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.800]   Yeah so let's say I wish I did I went through I said OK these are the things I want to
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.280]   prioritize this is my week.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   How do I start getting the things off that aren't important things like I have to
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.080]   prepare dinner I have to clean the house you know I have all like what are what are
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.120]   your tips for removing things that are not important.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   Yeah well when you don't think something is the best use of your time you have three
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.960]   options you can ignore it you can minimize it and you can outsource it.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.360]   Now obviously outsourcing is going to involve other people.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.920]   We do it all the time.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.360]   I mean I I've gotten all sorts of people being like well I can't afford to have my
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   house cleaned or whatever and that's fine.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.000]   But if we recognize that we already outsource so much I mean most of us are not
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.360]   churning our own butter.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   We are not sewing our own clothes.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.560]   So this is all just a matter of degree of what we choose to outsource versus what we
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.960]   do not then maybe people can approach it a bit more rationally and say like OK well
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.720]   what are the things that would be easiest to get to somebody else that would cost
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.360]   the least amount to do or if they have multiple family members for instance older
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.120]   children that may be a great idea for sharing the load there.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.640]   But ignoring and minimizing are the two that really should be getting the bulk of
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.720]   the attention because there is so much that doesn't actually need to get done or
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   doesn't need to get done to the standard that people might assume that it needs to
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   you know and many of these things are we don't even think about them.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.680]   It's just sort of how we've grown up with the stories we have about what we should
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.200]   be doing with our time.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.600]   You know I see this all the time on time logs.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.520]   People tell me like oh you know my mother always did a small load of laundry every
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.120]   day so I'm never behind on it.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.560]   I'm like wow you are doing laundry every single day and in your mind that's what
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.360]   you should be doing.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.680]   That's like what people do and not even question it or the idea that like small
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.640]   children need to be bathed nightly like if you want to great but they don't unless
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.280]   there's like a medical reason like you've been told it's absolutely critical for
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.960]   your child's skin condition or something like no most small children do not need
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.520]   that nightly.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.480]   So if you don't like it and it's not something that helps them sleep and therefore
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.920]   you're doing don't get rid of that.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.600]   It's fine.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.360]   You don't have to do it.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.280]   Packing lunches you know if kids are old enough to go to school where there's a
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.440]   cafeteria then they can either buy or they can pack their own lunch.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:58.000]   That's not something you really need to be doing or you know in general various
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.160]   personal care things.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.640]   I mean I'm glad we're not sharing too much of the video of this but I try to
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.480]   minimize you know how much personal care you do as well.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   And I'm sure some of your your female listeners may get more of this than maybe
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.560]   all your male listeners but many of the beauty standards aimed at women seem to
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.760]   assume that we just have all the time in the world to devote to these things.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.080]   I occasionally read these articles in women's magazines like how to do an eight
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.880]   minute face and save tons of time like eight minutes really.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.400]   Are we supposed to be spending eight minutes on makeup every day.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   Like how about how about 30 seconds.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.600]   Can we can we just do that.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.480]   Would that be better.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.400]   You know like there's people who won't face the world unless their hair is
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.640]   perfectly coiffed and blown out and it just it takes time and you should really
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.520]   question like is that necessary.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.920]   I think we've learned in the past year so many of us working from home that a lot
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.200]   of this is maybe less necessary than than we may have thought.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.160]   So ignore and minimize as much as possible when something is not the best use of
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.600]   your time.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.720]   One of the tips you mentioned at the end of your book was not to overthink dinner.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.240]   And I feel like when I first read that my instinct was well yeah you could just
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.760]   order dinner or get microwave meals or but I'm I would be curious if that's the
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.560]   actual process you follow or or how do you have healthy meals without spending an
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.920]   hour sitting there preparing and chopping and all that.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.240]   Yeah I this is another one that really gets me because I know that a lot of
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.160]   people grow up with the message that if you are going to get your family ready for
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.400]   the week you know you need to spend all Sunday like prepping meals for the week
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.040]   ahead and what happens is that people spend all this time preparing meals and
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.080]   then they still spend time getting them ready during the week.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.040]   It's like because I got to thaw the lasagna and then let me make a salad to go
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.440]   with the lasagna that's premade.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.560]   It's like you're still spending 20 30 minutes getting dinner on the table.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.000]   It's like well you could actually do a whole dinner in 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.600]   You can you know pick up a rotisserie chicken in a bag salad like that's that's
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.200]   made.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.280]   You don't even have to do anything.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.360]   But even if you're cooking I mean you could just throw some veggies and make an
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   omelet with scrambled eggs like that's dinner you know that is like a quick
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.640]   cooking piece of salmon and some veggies like on a sheet pan in the oven 20
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.280]   minutes or so.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.840]   Again not overthinking it.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.960]   There are all sorts of incredibly simple meals and having a few of these available
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.440]   to you and always having the ingredients for these things on hand can make life a
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.160]   lot easier.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.680]   Having rotating dinners like that the idea of Taco Tuesday is really brilliant if you
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.080]   think about it because if it's Tuesday you're having tacos and you can switch it
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.920]   up within that like I don't know this week it's chicken tacos next week it's steak
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.280]   tacos or shrimp tacos or whatever or you put different toppings on week to week and
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.120]   people choose their own.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.920]   But you always have the stuff for tacos when you go to the grocery store and then
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.400]   you never think about it because it's Tuesday and you're having tacos and that
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.440]   removes a lot of mental energy and allows you to just do what else you're doing
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.960]   until it's time to have dinner.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:08.400]   Yeah I think one of the best things to save time on dinner for us this past year
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.920]   where there's been a lot of cooking at home was we just found some meals that we're
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.680]   like you know what we could eat this every week and we just the coolest thing is not
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   only does it take out the overhead of what are we eating this week to reduce that but
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   also we've ended up just basically memorizing these recipes such that you can do
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.080]   it completely on autopilot.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.840]   You're like I know exactly what needs to be chopped.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.560]   I started to figure out oh well we need these ingredients for these two things so
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.320]   let's batch those together back at night after night.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.280]   And then we also just started doubling every dinner so that we didn't have to think
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:40.720]   about lunch.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.200]   Yeah leftovers are great and leftovers are wonderful.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.520]   I said don't make all your meals on Sunday but whenever you are cooking something if
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.120]   you make enough for the next day to have lunch then you've solved two meals at once.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:52.840]   So that's great.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.520]   Yeah exactly.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.680]   So OK so now we've kind of got this week that we're we know what we want to do.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   We've taken off the things we don't want to do.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   Actually I have one last one on the last one which is are there you know I know you
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.560]   said that minimizing and ignoring can be the most powerful but when it comes to
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.200]   outsourcing are there things that are less obvious that you think people could benefit
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.600]   from considering outsourcing.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:24.880]   Well I think that food prep is something that might be more worth outsourcing than
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:32.560]   many people consider if it is a source of stress in your household like who's making
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:32.960]   dinner.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.000]   If you have some sort of child care for instance like if this is the situation people
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   are in because they have young kids and two working parents if perhaps a babysitter
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.760]   could start dinner that would save you various time you know before you get home from
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.640]   work or if the meals can be pre prepped during a toddler's naptime for instance that
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.840]   could be one way to take it off your plate so to speak for a few nights a week.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:06.080]   So that's something that many people don't do but can in fact be a real benefit.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.320]   I mean more than like having a cleaning service come in to dust your baseboards like I
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.560]   mean you can just not dust the baseboards.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   That's another idea whereas you do have to eat.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.640]   So if that is the source of stress and you don't want to be doing takeout all the time
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:25.320]   it may actually be something that would be available as as part of child care or I mean
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.920]   heck hire somebody to come in and cook for you a couple of times a week.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.400]   It might in fact be cheaper than restaurant meals and takeout if you run the numbers on
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.760]   it and and that could solve that problem.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:44.160]   Yeah I just someone just sent me a site called chef.com but chef with an S and it's kind
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.000]   of like not quite meal delivery where you know you can do it on the night of you say
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.080]   OK next Friday I want to order from this person who lives you know in your kind of
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:00.320]   vicinity who's going to cook in this case like Persian food and you pick your meal and
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.240]   they deliver it at much less than you would pay from a restaurant because you're
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.680]   planning in advance they're going to make this for lots of people.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:13.320]   It's actually person to person not necessarily restaurants and it's something that I've
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.240]   queued up to do next week is to have two or three meals delivered in advance and we'll
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:19.920]   see how that goes.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.520]   Yeah that sounds like a great idea.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.080]   Look forward to hearing how it works.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.000]   That would certainly be an option for people as well.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.080]   Yeah I'll link it out in the show notes because it is not spelled as it sounds.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.440]   So if I've decided the things that I want to prioritize and I've decided the things
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   that I want to deprioritize I've kind of have a plan.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.160]   Is there a good time to do that planning.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.720]   Is there a good way to stick to those routines.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:51.280]   So I think that weekly planning will get most of the job done for most people.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.120]   I plan my weeks on Fridays.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.640]   I find that Friday is a really good week good day to make this happen because it tends to
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.200]   be slower.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.480]   It's also really hard to start anything new on Friday.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   Kind of like drifting into the weekend by Friday afternoon.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.720]   So we have a tendency to waste a lot of time on Fridays.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.680]   Whereas if you spend the time planning what future you should be doing you turn what might
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.320]   be wasted time into some of your most productive minutes of the week.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:25.080]   So Friday usually Friday afternoon I make a three category priority list for my upcoming
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.920]   week career relationships self the same three categories we talked about before.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.320]   What would I most like to accomplish in these categories over the course of the next week.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.560]   I make that list figure out roughly when those things can go look at what is already on my
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.520]   calendar for the upcoming week figure out any logistics that need to happen or if I
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.080]   want to ignore or minimize or get rid of something how I could do that for what is
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   already on my calendar.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.960]   And this whole process takes 20 minutes maybe.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:00.200]   And I say that as somebody with a family of two working parents five kids a dog a lot of
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.400]   logistics around here I think you know many people are like oh I'm too tired on Friday to
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.280]   plan it's like really.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.600]   Like what do you think it looks like.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.520]   It's not running a marathon.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.400]   Like we're talking 20 minutes max where you think about your upcoming week.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.440]   But if you do this week after week then you start to get a much better sense of control of
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.000]   your time like you know what is coming up you know you have a plan to deal with it and
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.200]   that can make your weekends far better too because part of that Sunday night blues
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.440]   people experience is that they know there's a lot of stuff waiting for the Monday like
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.040]   professionally probably personally too and they don't know what they're going to do about
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.680]   it so their brain is going over and over again trying to figure out what am I going to do
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.000]   about it.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.760]   But if you know because you had a plan that you made on Friday then you can relax.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.040]   And what about weekends.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.120]   It was really exciting to read because I'd never done the math that there are 60 hours
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.960]   between cracking a beer on Friday afternoon and going to work on Monday.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.280]   Do you plan those weekends on Friday night or are they part of the previous week's plan.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.680]   How do you make weekends the best they can.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.480]   So usually they are part of the previous Friday.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.040]   So I kind of view my Friday planning as mostly looking to the upcoming week the upcoming
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   week being Monday through that Sunday.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.320]   However because I am planning on Friday it allows me to take a second glance at what
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   is on the calendar for that upcoming weekend.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.920]   And so if I haven't sorted something through that's a last minute chance to do it or if
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   the weather has changed or something new has come up that allows me to also take a
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.120]   secondary look at the weekend that is just starting.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:41.200]   And you know other people may not need to do it that way again because of the five
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:49.120]   children two working parents like there I cannot let the weekend just be until last
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:55.520]   minute Friday night because there might be three children in different sporting activities
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.400]   at different places.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.520]   And if there's only two drivers well we've got to sort something out.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.280]   So other people might not need to do that but I do.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.080]   So that's that that's where that comes in.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.600]   But I would say you do need to plan your weekends.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.240]   I think a lot of people are like oh planning weekend that's totally a contradiction in
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.920]   terms that sounds terrible horrible.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.640]   I don't want to do that.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.760]   OK that is fine.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:25.280]   But if you just think of a few what I call anchor events like things that would be exciting
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.880]   to you to do over the course of the weekend and when roughly you think those should go
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.960]   like three things over the course of the weekend that would genuinely excite you or
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.200]   rejuvenate you you will have so much better weekends because the rest of the time can
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   be whatever I'm not nothing it's impossible to do nothing you'll do something it just
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.440]   may not be what you would have chosen if you thought about it.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.720]   But if you know you have these three anchor things in your weekend you will hit Monday
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.560]   feeling like yeah that was great.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:00.800]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a great addition
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.080]   to your New Year routine.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.640]   I am so excited to be partnering with them today.

[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:11.360]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.560]   cooking at home?
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.840]   If not definitely go back and give it a listen but one of his top hacks was using the microwave
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.320]   more.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.360]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.000]   from any day I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.040]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.320]   microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.800]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.640]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook serve store and reheat all in the
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.160]   same dish that happens to be dishwasher freezer and oven safe too and if you need a recipe

[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.760]   Yeah you mentioned putting together your list of either a hundred or a thousand dreams I
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.880]   guess it depends on the person on how many they want a thousand thousand probably too
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:55.600]   many yeah but how I found that doing that makes it easier to plan the weekend so having
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.800]   a list of things that you want to do that are exciting whether that's restaurants to
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.680]   go try now that you know we're opening things back up whether that's hikes you want to go
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.760]   on or a museum to see and so I love that idea I started batching mine together and separating
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.160]   it from what's usually often thought of as like my bucket list which is like I want to
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.240]   go you know to Greece which is not something I'm going to do next weekend yeah well the
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.080]   upside of it's a list of a hundred dreams which was it was an exercise shared with me
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.000]   by a career coach great many years ago and a lot of people have really responded well
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.600]   to this idea you can do a thousand that'd be great too but people will find that even
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.160]   a hundred is really really hard because the bucket list that you're talking about it is
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.760]   stuff like go to Greece and then you get like 20 places you want to visit and then you're
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.520]   like huh okay now what so with a hundred you have to keep going and so you can list like
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.760]   the dozen local restaurants you want to try and then you're still only at 32 items and
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.800]   so then you're like okay well here's these 15 state parks in you know within two hour
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:59.600]   drive that I want to go see and you're only at 47 so like you still have to keep coming
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.640]   back to this list over and over again and asking friends and family like what they recommend
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.400]   but having made this long and unedited list of anything you might want to do does make
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.960]   future planning easier because then you say like oh well we do have half a weekend day
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.840]   on this upcoming Saturday and oh hey I want to do strawberry picking with the kids and
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.920]   it's strawberry season we should do that right whereas if you haven't articulated that desire
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.720]   it may not occur to you to be like oh yes we should go strawberry picking with this
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.120]   few hours we have until it's you know strawberry season has come and gone
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.480]   yeah one one other weekend I guess hack that I've started using already is you said if
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.760]   you use weekends for chores it's less ideal because if you use weekdays for chores you'll
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   spend less time on them because you just have less time I thought this is great so we just
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.920]   started saying let's do all our chores on the weekdays and then they won't expand to
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.400]   fill the entire weekend so that hack I thought is worth sharing okay good well I'm glad you
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:06.640]   like that I mean yeah if you have the ability to you know well obviously people can order
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.240]   groceries too but if you're going to go to a store I mean there's nobody in the store
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.120]   at like 9 30 on Wednesday so if that's an option you have young kids one parent stays
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.960]   home with them and the other goes to the store like you can be in and out so quick because
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.760]   there's no line nothing going on there so that that and everything is stocked and everything
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.680]   is stocked that's true too I you know yeah I've had I've gone at like 5 a.m once when
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.480]   I was up early with the baby and it was like this this is the magical time at the 24-hour
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.680]   store where everything is there I'm the only person here it's great but yeah doing things
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.920]   at unorthodox times when you if you think about when would everybody do something and
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.240]   then do it at another time you can generally save a lot of time because you won't be having
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:53.040]   to deal with everyone else being there same thing with like you know throw a load of laundry
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.440]   in in the morning move it in to the dryer if you're working at home do it at lunch but
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.720]   if you're not just do it when you get home from work later in the day it's like do that
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.960]   twice a week and then you don't have to spend your Saturday by the laundry machine and that's
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.840]   great you can just do quick touch-ups if you are making dinner for instance and you're
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.720]   cleaning the kitchen like you know say okay we're gonna get this kitchen clean in say
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.960]   the next 15 minutes and just do a quick sweep through of everything else the common areas
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.800]   do that once or twice a week the extra stuff and again you don't have to spend the whole
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:31.840]   weekend cleaning as well while you are maintaining at least a reasonably clean home yeah people
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   have very different standards of what constitutes clean and if you are a person for whom it has to
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.920]   be spotless like you just have to acknowledge that either that's going to take a ton of time
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.560]   or a ton of money whereas if you can allow yourself to lower your standards a bit then
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.040]   that can save a lot of time and money so you know figure out what's worth it i thought that tip was
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.880]   great i proposed lowering our housekeeping standards but it did not go well there there
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:02.720]   are certain yes gendered aspects to this it is often harder for women to let go of housekeeping
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.280]   standards because it has been drilled into our heads that that is what people will judge us on
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:13.360]   and i even once heard this uh articulated that somebody had had been told like you think you're
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.640]   such hot stuff but there is dust under your beds like i just love that like who who would say that
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.280]   but somebody did to somebody it was just but that's what people have in the back of their
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:31.680]   minds so you know it might help to realize that many of us don't have all that many other people
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.080]   in our house these days anyway and if you were going to have people in your house you could
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.560]   deal with it like you could do a quick hour blitz and and get through like you'd probably have
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.280]   noticed like not that many of us have these situations where judgmental people are showing
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.760]   up at our house with no notice to come inspect under our beds so for most of us there's no home
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.080]   inspection coming up like a lot of people be like oh i can't go to i have to clean the house before
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.560]   i go to bed at night it's like well why you know is there an 11 p.m home inspection like no there
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.760]   is no 11 p.m home inspection nobody is coming to give you demerits for having toys on the floor
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:10.560]   and in fact those toys will just come out again next morning so you'll never get that oh yes they
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:18.640]   come out every day every day so i feel like and maybe this is a result of you know a young child
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.880]   in the house but sometimes at the end of the week my wife and i are like what do we want to do this
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.520]   weekend and we're like i just don't want to do anything i feel like we did so much and we didn't
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.960]   stop for a second what do you do when you have those feelings or how have you avoided having
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.680]   those feelings well the one thing i would say is that having time at home with no plans with a
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:47.280]   small child is often way more exhausting than getting out and doing something and i have learned
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.880]   this in many cases the hard way that if there are a bunch of kids arguing and fighting and throwing
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:59.040]   things around all saturday morning it feels hellish whereas if we go to the zoo people have
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.320]   other things to look at to direct their energy and rather than punching your sister you can look at
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.600]   the monkeys and then you come home at lunch and then people can have quiet time afterwards because
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:15.040]   they're tired or the people who nap can nap and then you know go out again at 3 34 do something
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.720]   little then and then the day is over and that is a much better way to manage your energy than facing
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:27.280]   like 12 hours of nothingness on a saturday which won't be nothing it'll be you guys chasing around
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   the 10 month old and trying to keep the 10 month old from sticking up was it a boy or girl sorry
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.840]   a girl a girl from sticking a fork in her eye and then you know be like well i i had i was with her
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.000]   more during this amount of time and you were with her more for this amount of time yeah it's just
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.520]   have a plan it it's so much better for managing energy so we talked a lot about weekends one of
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:56.240]   the books that i did read before this was about what the most successful people do before breakfast
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.600]   could you talk a little bit about what you've learned about mornings and why they can be so
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:08.880]   valuable so mornings are a really good time for getting stuff done for people who have
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.640]   traditional in the office jobs and particularly who have families who are going to need and want
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:20.960]   to see them after work morning is another chunk of the day that can be discretionary time there's
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.600]   that time and then there's the late at night time the problem is that the late at night time is
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.760]   harder to use for certain sorts of activities like most people are not going to leave the
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:35.120]   house and go for a run at 9 p.m most people do not have the energy to write a chapter in their
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.920]   novel at 10 p.m now there are some people who do that's great more power to them most people are
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:44.160]   not going to be able to do that and that's why we tend to do the more low energy stuff at night
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:51.360]   whereas morning most people have more discipline and energy and focus in the morning again not
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:58.640]   everybody but most people and so if that sounds like it might be you figuring out that there is
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:04.400]   something that you would like to do that life has a way of crowding out maybe you can make time for
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.040]   it in the morning and so i kept seeing this on time logs like if there was somebody who had a
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.720]   huge job and a family they were raising and then they also you know exercised five times a week
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.440]   or they also you know had a great meditation practice or a spiritual practice they were
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.160]   doing frequently or who you know was doing creative writing or some sort of hobby like that
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.320]   it tended to be that they were doing it first thing in the morning and and so i started seeing
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:34.160]   this over and over again on time logs and decided i had to investigate further and have you had
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.560]   mornings yourself i know i have where you wake up and you're like gosh i wanted to get up at six i
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:44.080]   just feel awful like can you jump start that productivity or is that a day where you just say
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.720]   today i'm just going to give myself another hour of sleep well usually that's a decision that could
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:54.000]   be made the night before because the reason you feel bad waking up at 6 a.m often has to do with
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.360]   what time you went to bed the night before so it this is just math like if you need seven and a
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   half hours of sleep and you're in a position which again you may not be with the 10 month old baby
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:09.440]   but let's say that's not part of your life at the moment you you know if you're waking up at six and
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:15.680]   you went to bed at 11 30 well that's six and a half hours so that explains why you are tired at
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.080]   6 a.m whereas if you went to bed at 10 30 then you would have gotten your seven and a half hours and
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.960]   you probably would feel pretty good at 6 a.m but you can then make that decision the night before
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.560]   if you have any sort of control over when you can get up in the morning it's like well i didn't get
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   to bed till 11 30 so i actually do need to sleep until closer to seven if that is at all possible
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:39.520]   in my life so i really do think that that the wake-up decision should be a function of when
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   you went to bed as opposed to being like no no no i have to do x at 6 a.m and then you'll just crash
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.880]   the next night and not be able to do anything too i mean people people will get to the amount of
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.000]   sleep they need the question is whether it is disorderly or orderly and it's much better in
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.320]   our life if it's a more orderly matter yeah and and part of recreating mornings which is something
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.760]   i'm kind of trying to do it's like okay we're going to introduce exercise that's a new routine
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.680]   not that i have an exercise but in the mornings as frequently and consistently any tips for when
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:19.840]   you're trying to introduce new habits well start small i also think that for many people it would
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:25.360]   help to not view the morning routine as something they need to do every single day and and there may
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.120]   be people who disagree with me because they're like it's a routine but i've found over the years
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.160]   of talking to people that many people do not do their same morning routines on say saturday and
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.960]   sunday and they don't do it on vacations and if you're not doing it on those days then it isn't
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.840]   in fact a daily routine it is a five times a week routine or maybe even a four times a week if
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.760]   they're only doing it monday to thursday because friday is different for some reason so a lot of
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.680]   these people with daily routines i'm putting daily in my quote marks um are doing it four times a
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:59.360]   week so if you want to aim for three to four times a week that's great that can still be count as a
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:04.560]   routine and then that also makes it possible for people who need to trade off with a partner in
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.120]   terms of like kid coverage in the morning like you know i'm gonna exercise three times a week
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.560]   in the morning you're gonna exercise two to three times a week in the morning it's fine that you can
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:19.040]   trade off for each other start small like do something that you will enjoy and that you will
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:27.600]   stick with so if you hate running don't choose running as your morning routine exercise because
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.360]   you will not get out of bed to do it whereas if you love it then you will if you'd prefer to do a
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.560]   exercise video or lift weights or you know get on your peloton bike or maybe there's a class you'd
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.960]   love to go to at 6 00 a.m two days a week like those are the sorts of things people will stick
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.680]   with but if it's like i have to exercise and i have to do x that i hate but i'm just gonna power
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:53.280]   through it it's like okay well you will for a few days and then something will happen to derail you
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.440]   and you won't get back into it because you don't want to do it yeah one of the things that i
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:02.320]   think gets a lot of people in the morning is you know your phone's right there and all of a sudden
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.640]   you're looking at your email and you're not getting out of bed to do the exercise you you
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.840]   even love and want so one thing that i've tried to do and it works sometimes and then i fall out
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:16.320]   of it but is i just try to plug my phone in somewhere where i have to get out of bed to grab
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:21.600]   it it doesn't have to be the i leave it in the kitchen but it's like i have to stand up and once
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.640]   i'm standing up i'm like i should probably use this time to go on a run i'm already out of bed
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.320]   yeah um but the nights where the phone just ends up on the nightstand the next morning i feel like
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:38.240]   i instantly lose 20 or 30 minutes yeah that can definitely happen you know and it's so easy to
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   look and check so you know if you need to check the weather but still you're just like oh but
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:50.960]   it's right there i could just look so easily so yeah doing as much as you can to keep yourself
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.120]   on your routine probably whatever it is can be dealt with after you've gone and exercised for
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:59.760]   20 30 minutes too so you might even just stick the phone in your pocket in case there's an
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:06.320]   emergency but not look at it yeah and you know we talked about 168 hours a lot of them are sleeping
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.720]   a lot of them hopefully we can redefine uh after this but a lot of them are at work and i'm curious
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.080]   are there especially in light of you know lots of work from home and your new book the new corner
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.200]   office last year are there they're kind of common tips people should take to work with them for
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.680]   better productively managing their work days well i think being mindful about time is important for
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.640]   leisure time and it's important for work time now in terms of work time people do think about
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.560]   their time because you know we have appointments we have to do we have things we have to accomplish
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.280]   and those can make time feel bigger than it is which is one of the reasons that people think
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.920]   they work more hours than they tend to but on any given day think like well what would make for a
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.440]   good day like what three to five things do i really need to accomplish today that can be your
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.160]   to-do list for the day and then when you've done those things you know you've had a good day i
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.400]   mean maybe other things happen maybe other things don't but by setting limited but well-chosen goals
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:14.320]   for any given day you can make progress and you can feel accomplished and then you know when things
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.000]   will be done because you view your to-do list as a contract with yourself i mean i think that's one
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.440]   of the key things is that we do each day what we set out to do and yes stuff comes up which is why
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.400]   you have to make the list of things you absolutely will get to very very short but when you choose
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:37.600]   them well then you will make progress yeah i just listened to the episode of your podcast where you
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.880]   talk about email and and i saw that you you know wrote a review on in the wall street journal for
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:49.280]   uh cal newport's a world without email book i feel like email like i know you do is is kind of
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.360]   this thing that sucks up all time are there a couple quick tips or hacks about how to rethink
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.840]   about email so it doesn't end up eating your whole day yeah um i enjoyed cal's book i mean i think we
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.800]   are not going to have a world without email but i think a world with a lot less email is within
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.680]   our ability to get and some of this is organizational if you work for yourself
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.400]   then you can set your own parameters on it i tend to just not check it for a while if i don't want
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.440]   to check it and that's fine nothing's really you know nobody can do anything to me but yeah if you
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.040]   work in an organization you really need to set these parameters as a group and come up with ways
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.520]   to not be sending each other random emails back and forth constantly maybe it's that you do short
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.720]   check-ins on the status of things maybe it's that you use project management software maybe it's
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   that you tell people to pick up the phone it's crazy idea but that's often a much more efficient
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:51.840]   way to get a bit of information than having like a 12 email back and forth chain yeah yeah i i'm
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.400]   trying to reduce my email time because it's just it's taking over okay last big thing i want to
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.160]   talk about so i have this 10 month old and you've gone through five children and i i know that you've
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.080]   learned a lot is there obviously i feel like i've lost a lot of time and i've gained a lot of
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.520]   happiness uh but are there hacks you have for managing time with kids that a new parent should
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:22.320]   really be thinking about well i think it's the same mindfulness that we've been talking in all
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.080]   other aspects of life that you think about your days ahead of time you think about what would make
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.000]   for good additions to your life like things you want to do with your kids when you can make those
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.680]   happen and it's you know i think entering the kids worlds from time to time and certainly as
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.200]   as they get older you start to see more of the things that they are really interested in and it
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.720]   doesn't take much time but having little bits of time that you are devoted fully to those things
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:04:00.480]   that they are interested in can be some of the more fun parts of of parenting i've done every
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.200]   summer i try to do what we call mommy days with each of my kids i take my older kids each kid
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.520]   gets a one on one day with me we go do something that the kid really wanted to do and it's it's
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.840]   just so pleasant because they're not fighting with some other kid about like who gets to do what and
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.640]   we i wanted to do this but we did this and so now i have to do this and so you can't do it all the
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.480]   time i mean i wouldn't claim that people who are only children it's like all of life is like that
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.280]   because it isn't because their parents get like exhausted with just dealing with them but when we
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.840]   are managing a crowd like we are uh having just little bits of time focused on each kid can be
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.480]   great and i sort of try to think about my weeks that way too like if i've built in some small
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.040]   chunk of time with each kid one-on-one with them and if i have then it's been good so so trying to
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.720]   take advantage of that as much as possible yeah and the last thing you said about kids that really
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.040]   stuck with me is that part of making over your mornings has been investing time to make your
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.240]   children more self-reliant are there are there tips for helping make children more self-reliant
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.400]   and they might they might not be relevant at 10 months but as my 10 month old is not going to be
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:12.240]   that self-reliant you shouldn't shouldn't hold it against her but but as she gets older things
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.520]   you've done that have helped there well i think just expecting them to do they i think the more
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:26.320]   you kind of do for your kids the more they then expect you to do that for them so i'm certainly
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.680]   not the kind of person who chooses my kids outfits i feel like you know that's your business your
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.040]   fashion statements not my problem it has nothing to do with me if you wear something like you know
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   i mean i'll stop you if it's 30 degrees out and you're leaving without a coat but
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.760]   other than that kind of kind of your call having kids learn how to make lunches for instance when
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.640]   we were doing hybrid and virtual schooling for a long time there's definitely lessons on how you
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.320]   get your own food because i can't make lunch for everyone every day you know we're working on
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   various things in terms of getting clothes put away and helping with household chores and you
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.760]   know managing your own school work i definitely think that's something that you just have to
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:17.920]   decide as a parent like i already did sixth grade i don't need to do sixth grade again and if things
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.760]   go wrong in sixth grade it won't be the end of the world and they will learn from it so that's
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:31.120]   generally been my philosophy hopefully it won't go horribly wrong but we'll see that's the one
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.680]   thing i mean you know i i don't like to give a whole lot of parenting advice i'd have to say
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:43.360]   because i i feel like it's just asking for your your kid to do something terrible and it'd be like
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.680]   that person claimed to be a parenting expert and you have no control over it ultimately i mean
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:56.880]   people are their own people and they make their own choices in life ultimately and so you just
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.520]   have to you know do your best to make sure everything goes well that's what we're trying
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.440]   any other fun life or or money or any kind of hacks that you love that you want to share
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.560]   i know you said it's not about getting back those five ten minutes here and there but it is something
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:21.440]   that i know listeners love to hear uh any tricks to to feel more optimized and efficient well one
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.360]   thing i would say is that hunting for lost items feels like the biggest waste of time in the world
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.800]   so as much as possible having a set location for anything you use frequently and if it is
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:41.760]   ever found not in that location it needs to be immediately returned so all my kids shoes
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:48.960]   backpacks coats sports equipment are in the mud room in certain you know they don't have to be
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.600]   nicely lined up this isn't something you'll see on pinterest but if shoes are ever found elsewhere
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.400]   they are immediately returned there and so that way you're not spending 10 minutes every morning
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:06.080]   looking for shoes which if we were doing would just make life impossible so you know find a
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.960]   home for spots find a home for things keep them in that spot train everyone that it never goes
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.560]   anywhere else and hopefully you'll spend a lot of less time looking for stuff great this has been
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.960]   fantastic thank you so much for being here where can people read more learn more about you and
