[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there is.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   But all this research takes time and there are only so many hours in the day.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.720]   So today I'm so excited to be talking to Laura Vanderkam, who helps people spend
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.040]   more time on what matters and less on what doesn't.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   She's the author of several time management and productivity books,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.880]   including What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast and 168 Hours.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   Her work has appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Fast
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   Company, and Fortune.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680]   She hosts two podcasts, Before Breakfast and Best of Both Worlds, and blogs at
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.760]   lauravanderkam.com.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   I have no idea how anyone could have time for all that, and she has five children,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400]   but that's exactly why we're here today.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.280]   Laura, thank you for being here.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.600]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.520]   I just wanted to kick this off and ask, like, what is the biggest
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   misconception you think people have about time management?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.840]   Well, that it's about doing more with your time.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.960]   Many people are interested in hacks, as why we listen to a podcast like this,
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.280]   where, you know, we're going to save time by, I don't know, cleaning the
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.160]   shower while we're in it or soaking our pasta before we boil it so it takes less
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.360]   time to boil, or sending emails where, instead of saying "okay," you just write
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.480]   "kay" because we feel like we are somehow more efficient when we don't use the
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.440]   letter "o."
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.400]   And that's fine.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.800]   I mean, there's no point in spending more time on things than we need to, but
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   fundamentally, time management is about using the time we have to build the lives
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.680]   we want, and sometimes that is about being very efficient with things and getting
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.520]   through quickly, and sometimes it's about throwing gobs of time against
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   something because it's what you really want to do.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.320]   Yeah, one of the things that stood out to me, I had a chance to read a couple of
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.800]   your books, you've written a lot, so I apologize, I didn't get to all of them
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.240]   yet, but in every single one, you emphasize that when people say they don't
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.160]   have time, it's not really true, they have time, it's just not necessarily a
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.480]   priority, and you emphasize a lot that people actually have 168 hours every
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   week, which leaves them with somewhere between 60 and 70 non-waking, non-work
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.200]   hours, depending on how much they work, and so I'm curious, when you talk to
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.560]   people about how much time they have, how do you suggest people start to get
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.160]   started just thinking about what that means in their own life?
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   Yeah, well, first, switching to that 168-hour perspective is huge for most
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.880]   people, we are accustomed to thinking in life in terms of days, which is 24
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.080]   hours, but in fact, you live life in weeks, so that's 24 times 7, or 168
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   hours, which is, by the way, a number I didn't know until I multiplied it
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.160]   through and I started writing about this, I don't know why we don't know that
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.960]   number, but that's the number of hours in a week, and the reason this is
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   important, I mean, it gives us a more complete picture of our time, like, is
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.880]   Tuesday a normal day for you, or Saturday a normal day for you? They both
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   occur just as often, and they both have the exact same number of hours, but
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.600]   many people spend them very differently, and if we only look at one of them,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.320]   then we have a misleading perception of time, so thinking about 168 hours gets
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.120]   rid of that issue, and also just shows us how much time we have, like you
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.600]   said, if you are working a 40-hour-a-week full-time job, so standard
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.880]   full-time hours, if you are sleeping 8 hours a night, which is 56 hours per
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.560]   week, that leaves 72 hours for other things, which is, you know, quite a bit
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.320]   of time, and obviously, people have different levels of responsibility
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.560]   within that 72 hours. I mean, some people have nothing else they need to do
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.600]   within that. Some people have more intense caregiving responsibilities, for
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.240]   instance, which can certainly take a lot of that time, but one way or the
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.120]   other, I have not seen anyone's schedule where they don't have some
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.480]   discretionary time. Maybe it's not as much as we want, but it is some, and
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.280]   when we have that perspective that we probably have some, then we can change
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.320]   our narrative from, "I have no free time whatsoever. I have no time for
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.520]   anything. I'm a victim of circumstance," to, "I have some amount of time that I
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.360]   have autonomy over. What would I like to do with it? What kind of life would I
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.320]   like to create within this time that I have?"
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.160]   Yeah, I can't imagine anyone listening says, "Okay, I have all this time. I
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.720]   want to change that narrative," or, "I don't want to change that narrative."
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.080]   What is the kind of first step to start changing that narrative?
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.800]   Well, I am a big believer in actually tracking our time, which, before your
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.360]   listeners flee, is really in keeping with the whole life hacking mindset. You
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.760]   know, we want to know the data so we can make the best of it. So, I have
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.640]   actually been tracking my time on weekly spreadsheets for 6 years. You do
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.280]   not have to do that. Nobody has to do that. I'm a bit of a time management
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.440]   freak, but I do think it is helpful to try tracking your time for 1 week. See
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.640]   where the time really goes. Many people are quite surprised about where the
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.160]   time goes because, again, if you don't know there are 168 hours in a week, it
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.200]   is very hard to figure out the proportions. I mean, you don't know the
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.360]   denominator, so we're just kind of flying blind. If you get paid by the
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.080]   hour, you know how many hours you work. If you don't get paid by the hour, this
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.320]   can be a far more nebulous concept, and people put all sorts of numbers on it
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.040]   that are more based on how they feel about their work than the actual usual
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.960]   hours. Same thing with sleep. If we feel tired, we tend to put a low number on
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.760]   it as opposed to actually tracking it. If we feel like we don't have a lot of
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.520]   free time, we'll decide we have zero or have very little amount, and then you
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.440]   track and say, "Well, oh, I do have some. Maybe it's like two hours after my
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.040]   young kids go to bed and before I do." But because we're not thinking in that
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.080]   mindset, we don't see that it's there. And when we tell ourselves we have no
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.880]   time, then we don't think about what we want to do with it. We spend it in
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.320]   effortless ways. So try tracking your time for a week. I promise it will be
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.800]   worthwhile. You will discover interesting things, and then you can
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.760]   decide what you want to do with that data.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.720]   Yeah. And I assume if you've tracked your time for six years, you've found
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.840]   that there isn't an app that's better than a spreadsheet. It sounds like
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.960]   spreadsheet is just the easiest, simplest way.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   You know, I think there are probably different schools of thought on this.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.200]   There are definitely a lot of time tracking apps on the market. And if any
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.800]   of your listeners are particularly into apps or think it would be more
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   straightforward or easy for them to stick with it with an app, then by all
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.120]   means use that. I like the spreadsheets because it forces me to account for my
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.960]   time. Like, I actually have to write it down, similar in the way people who
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.360]   are into budgeting, for instance, often like to manually track their spending
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.240]   so they know where it goes. It also serves as a diary because I'm writing
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   what I'm doing. And so there's a little space for narrative there as I write
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.560]   things. And I also don't have to be quite as good about what category does
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.080]   this fall into, because my spreadsheets are a bit less exact than I think an
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.800]   app would force you to be in terms of categorizing, because the app wants to
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.240]   make a pie chart out of your time. And so all your categories have to be
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive. And on my spreadsheet, if
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.480]   I'm just manually adding things up, I don't have to do that.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.000]   Yeah. And what are the most common things you think people find as things
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.400]   that they need to get rid of or things that are wasting their time?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.080]   Well, I think the biggest thing that wastes time is just being mindless about
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.640]   it, not thinking about how we would like to spend our time. And so when we do
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.000]   have time that could be discretionary, we are not prepared to seize it. So as
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.200]   an example, if you don't think about what you want to do on the weekend,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   like you'll sit there on Saturday morning sort of hemming and hawing, be
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.880]   like, "Oh, I don't know what I want to do. What does everyone else want to do?"
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.640]   If you're with another group of people, if you have a family or other people
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.760]   you might spend weekends with, like, you don't get started on this decision
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.840]   until midday. And then half the time you could have used for something on
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.920]   Saturday is already gone. So many of the things that you could have chosen are
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.960]   not there. Or you had this time from the morning until midday that could have
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.240]   been devoted to something really fun that if you'd thought about it ahead of
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   time and, you know, had the logistics in place to do it. And so that's what
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.640]   winds up happening to people. Or, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.760]   particularly if any of your listeners have, you know, jobs and young kids, a
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.080]   lot of your during the week leisure time will occur at night, right? After young
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.040]   kids go to bed. And so, like, it could be a reasonable amount of time. It could
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.000]   be, you know, 90 minutes, two hours. But if you're not really thinking of it as,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.520]   "I have this chunk of time. I can choose to do something that I want to with this
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.040]   time," then you'll just start scrolling around online or, like, resorting the
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.320]   mail pile or puttering around the house or doing nothing of any, you know,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.560]   interest to you, really. It's not really relaxing you. It's not rejuvenating
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.680]   you. It's not what you would have chosen if you'd actually thought about, like,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.400]   "Hey, I have two hours. I don't have childcare responsibilities. I have this
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.440]   as leisure time. What would I like to do?" So being mindful allows you to seize
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.760]   the time that is there. And if we think about how we'd like to spend our time,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.320]   we vastly increase the chances that we use it for things that are meaningful to
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.680]   us.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.200]   Yeah, do you think it's more helpful to start with, "Okay, so I've time tracked a
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.480]   week, and I've looked at everything in the calendar or in the calendar or the
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.320]   spreadsheet. Do I start with what are the things that are meaningless and remove
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.600]   them? Or do I start with what are the things that I should prioritize?"
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.960]   I actually think you should start with that question of what you want to spend
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   more time doing in your life. And that is because it, you know, when we fill our
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.960]   lives with the stuff that we want to have there, everything else just naturally
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.280]   takes less time. I mean, we can spend all sorts of time coming up with these hacks
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.840]   like sending our emails that say "K" instead of "Okay," right, to save a few
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.480]   minutes. But then, you know, what are you doing with that time? Whereas if you
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.320]   have a project at work that you are so excited about, and that you have put big
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.520]   chunks of time into your work schedule to work on, like, you are naturally
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.000]   sending fewer stupid emails, because you don't want to. Like, you don't want to
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   devote the time to it. You have other things that have a bigger claim on your
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.320]   time that you really want to do. Same thing in our personal life. I mean,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.200]   there's all sorts of hacks to spend less time on housework to do it more
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.120]   efficiently. But if you are, you know, meeting with your bowling league every
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.280]   Tuesday night, and going out and doing that, like, you're not going to be
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.640]   spending all that time puttering around the house randomly cleaning stuff up
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.560]   that just gets dirty again five minutes later, because you have something that's
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.040]   worthwhile and enjoyable to you. And so everything else fills in around the
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.560]   craps.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.680]   Yeah, I think we have a 10 month old and we have an au pair and she ends her day
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.360]   at 530. And I'm like, so efficient to be done at 530 in a way that I feel like I
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.440]   would would have spilled over till 630. So you phrased it in the book, create a
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.920]   life so exciting, you want to work faster, at some point, and I've seen that
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.760]   come to life. So, you know, what are the things that you think people get the
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.440]   most value from prioritizing?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:59.200]   Well, I think there are three main categories that I kind of put
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.160]   priorities into that I find many people find helpful. Obviously, there's the
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.360]   professional stuff. So your career, hopefully, something that you find
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.120]   exciting and meaningful that how you're making this big impact on the world
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.440]   relationships. So that would be your family and friends, the things that you
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.400]   wish to prioritize in building those relationships and making them stronger.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.680]   And then finally, in the category of self. So those are the things that are
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.960]   enjoyable for you nurturing your health, maintaining energy, your spiritual
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.640]   development, or any hobbies that you wish to do. So those three categories
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.840]   tend to be the ones that are most worth prioritizing.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.280]   Yeah, and the one kind of small thing you mentioned in the book was that
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.440]   exercise kind of which falls into that third category of prioritizing yourself
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.360]   can actually sometimes make time.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.720]   Yeah, I really think that sleep and exercise don't take time so much as they
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.760]   do make time. Because whatever time you devote to those things within reason is
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   going to be paid back to you in terms of more energy, a better focus. Whereas if
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.720]   you deliberately skip on those things, thinking that you are going to save time
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.000]   somehow, I think we have all had the experience. I mean, particularly if you
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   have a 10 month old, if you had a bad night, everything takes longer the next
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.880]   day, like you just don't have the resources to get through hard stuff when
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.720]   you are tired. And it's not that you did something wrong. It's just that that's
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.520]   the nature of the energy where people be like, Oh, yeah, I'm gonna work hard work
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.440]   through lunch. I'm at my desk all day, you know, I'll get through everything. I
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.160]   mean, yes, we want to be efficient, but you don't get up and move or anything
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   like that. Don't take any breaks. And come to 33 o'clock in the afternoon,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.720]   you're reading the same email six times in a row, like you're following a link
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.960]   in there. And next thing you know, you didn't mean to me, but you're somewhere
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.080]   in social media lost, like reading headlines about stuff you totally didn't
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.600]   mean to, or looking at photos of people you didn't like in high school anyway.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.480]   And all this time can disappear, because you needed a break, and you didn't take
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.040]   a break. So it's far better to decide, like, I'm going to go for a brisk walk
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.320]   at two o'clock in the afternoon, come back, you can actually focus. So that 30
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:21.400]   minutes was technically not working. But if you are able to work much more
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.760]   efficiently afterwards, then you didn't lose time in the process.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.960]   And you think people should schedule those breaks or just kind of be try to
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.400]   be aware that they need to happen?
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   It depends what kind of job you have. If you have a very flexible job where you
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.280]   don't have a whole lot of scheduled commitments, then sure, do it. Whenever
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.720]   you really notice yourself getting into that moment of being low energy and
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.000]   needing some sort of break. On the other hand, you know, if you have different
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.920]   patients, you're seeing every 20 minutes, obviously, you're going to have to be
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.880]   more proactive about scheduling that in in order to have that break, whenever
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.760]   that would be possible within your schedule.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.800]   And so I tried to go through a lot of these exercises in advance of speaking
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.280]   with you, because I thought it'd be helpful. And I thought about, okay,
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.880]   career, family, yourself. And then I thought, what about all these things
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.320]   that we all have on our kind of to do list, if you will, like, I need to go to
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.640]   the DMV sometime before my license expires, I want to organize the garage,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.160]   things that never seem to be a priority that I want to do now, but I know
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.520]   sometimes have to happen. How do how do people how should people kind of think
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.000]   about prioritizing them and when to do them? They feel like they always just
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.720]   get pushed off?
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.600]   Yeah, well, I mean, these are things that you can, in fact, put on your to do
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.120]   list, I suggest people as much as possible, try to batch things like that,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.280]   and put them all on a certain day, a certain chunk of hours, because then it
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.840]   forces prioritization within that, right? Like, if you have all weekend to run
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.200]   errands, like it can take all weekend to run your errands. Whereas if you say,
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.320]   okay, I had to get everything done in this two hour block, two and a half hour
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.240]   block, whatever it is you wanted to vote to it, you will be more efficient within
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.160]   that time or within, you know, cleaning your house, same thing. If you say, okay,
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.480]   we're going to clean this whole thing in 90 minutes, everyone's focused on it,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.320]   everyone's doing it, we're going to get it done. And then the upside of that, too,
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.360]   is not only does it force efficiency within that, like, if you find yourself
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.680]   looking at a dirty floor at some other point, you don't have to be like, oh, I
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.400]   should go do that instead of whatever I'm doing right now. And be like, oh,
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.040]   yeah, there's a time for cleaning the floor. Now is not that time. Right. And
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.200]   that allows us to relax. So whenever we can batch things, it forces the
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.000]   prioritization within the batched window, and then also allows our brains to
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.680]   relax and let go of that constant loop of I should be doing X. That keeps us
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.440]   from relaxing, it keeps us from focusing on things that we have chosen to do
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.920]   during any given time. Because yeah, you know, there's a time to go to the DMV,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.840]   you've set it up, it's for, you know, Friday morning, you're going to do all
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.320]   these things. And that's when you're going to go and now is not Friday
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.720]   morning, so I can stop thinking about it.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.440]   So a lot of the things we've been talking about take a good portion of your
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.600]   time. But what about when you just have three to five minutes, whether a
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.840]   meeting ends early or you're waiting in line? Is there anything you can do with
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.280]   that time to make it more productive?
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.160]   I think you should use that time to read. I mean, most of us pick up our
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.960]   phones and check email or scroll through social media or check headlines in
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.600]   those little bits of time. And it makes sense because our phones are there.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.280]   They are convenient. These are things we can interact with in short and
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.920]   uncertain amounts of time. But there are other things you can do too. If you
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.240]   have an eReader app on your phone, and put eBooks on your phone, then you can
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.040]   use those little bits of time to read. Now, you may not want to choose, like,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.600]   the most gripping novel ever for five minutes of time, because then you'll be
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.040]   very, very sad when the person calls you and you're like, "Darn it, I have to
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   put it down." But, like, a lot of nonfiction, for instance, could be read
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.640]   in those small chunks of time. And those small chunks of time really add up. It
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.400]   is not at all unusual for people to have 30 minutes of these small chunks of
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.120]   time through the day. And, hey, if you use that to read, that's 30 more
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.840]   minutes of reading you get done per day. That's, you know, 210 minutes a week,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.560]   which is three and a half hours. And that's a lot. Like, you could be getting
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.520]   through an extra book a week in that amount of time. So consider doing that
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.000]   with your little bits of time instead.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.360]   What about people? So you talked about family and relationships. I find that
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:28.960]   sometimes people, you know, can turn into, at least for me, what I'll call
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.240]   like the human version of email, where you can meet up with someone. And next
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.440]   thing you know, you're talking for four hours. And it's not that I don't want to
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   spend time with people. It's not that I don't want to build these
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.200]   relationships. But there's also only 168 hours in a week. And, you know, I may
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.880]   only want to prioritize an hour of spending time with someone. But it just
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.200]   always ends up falling into three hours to do dinner or go out for drinks or
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.520]   have someone over. Do you have any kind of tips for keeping relationships
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.640]   strong, but not throwing, you know, the whole week into it?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.760]   Yeah, well, I mean, if you have people like that, that you do want to see, but
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.960]   you want to limit the time, your best bet is coming up with stuff that is more
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.040]   naturally limited. So, you know, you meet the person for a walk, you probably
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.600]   aren't going to walk for three hours. Like, it's just, you know, we're going to
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.440]   do this loop around this lake, which is two miles. When we are done with the two
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.120]   miles, we are, in fact, done. And so that is something that might be more
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   naturally limited. Or if you know you have a scheduled commitment afterwards,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.160]   you can be very clear about this. Be like, "Hey," you know, as we're talking,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.680]   "I wanted to make sure I caught up with you. Just, you know, by the way, I said
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.520]   I'd have to call my mom at whatever time, just so you know." But anyway,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.840]   something that you know there is an end to it. Because I think that's totally
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.920]   fine. There's certainly people that we want to spend time with, we don't want
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.560]   to spend all our time with. And if it gets to that, then you can sort of say,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.680]   you know, "I'm willing to spend within this window, like five minutes to 60
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.960]   minutes. That is the upper limit. We will always end it around that time." You
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.840]   know, and as long as you're nice about it, I think people are going to roll
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.880]   with it. And especially if it seems like there's a real circumstance that is
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.080]   ending it. It's not like, "Yeah, I've had enough of you."
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.040]   Yeah. And one of the quotes that was probably, it might be my favorite quote
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.720]   was, "It can take hours to buy back the goodwill burned in a two second glance
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.360]   at your phone while someone's trying to tell you something important." And my
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:32.080]   takeaway from that quote kind of ties in here, which was, if you know that
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.880]   you're spending 30 minutes with someone, and you've said, "Look, this is the
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.240]   time I've decided I want to spend with you." It kind of makes it more easy to
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.520]   say, "I want to be here. I'm going to be present. I'm going to turn everything
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.760]   else off because I've prioritized it." Versus get a random phone call, answer
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.040]   the phone call while you're cleaning the house. Now you're in the middle of
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.000]   one activity trying to do another. It's probably not even the most productive
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.360]   hour on either task at hand, talking to the friend or cleaning the house. So I
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.600]   don't know, that quote really stuck with me as an inspiration for, "When you are
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.440]   doing something, just focus on that."
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.920]   Yeah. I would also say, because people may want to do that, but what often
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.360]   happens is, "What time is it?" Because they do have something they have to do
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:21.720]   afterwards. And so one thing you can do is set alarms. And I've seen my husband
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.000]   do this for business situations. If he's talking to a client, he wants the person
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.040]   to feel like he is fully focused on them, but he has to leave to catch a train or
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.440]   something. So he has an old-fashioned watch, like a digital wristwatch. And he
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   sets an alarm for if the meeting was at 2 and he has to leave at 3. It's like
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.960]   2.55, it goes off. So he's totally relaxed until 2.55 when that alarm goes
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.320]   off, which sounds like something totally separate. It wasn't him, he didn't do
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.080]   anything. He wasn't looking at the clock to see what time it was. So that's
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.880]   something you can do so that you know you won't have to think about it. You
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.880]   won't have to sneak glances at your phone or something else when you're
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   talking to the person. And yet you know it will be stopped when you need to
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.800]   stop.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.360]   Yeah. Mine is, I've turned off all vibrations for notifications and
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   messages and anything. Someone told me, "Oh, just turn your phone
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.240]   airplane mode. Turn it off. You don't see the screen." Well, that means that
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.640]   if there's something that you need to check, it's like a big hassle. But if
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.480]   you could turn off all the vibrations, all the noise, then your phone could
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.320]   sit in your pocket. It might as well be on airplane mode, as far as you're
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.800]   concerned, until you take it out. But there is nothing more frustrating than
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.040]   trying to be present and then it's like, "Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz."
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.600]   And it's usually nothing. I mean, it's like the group text from the people
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.680]   that always are group texting.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.200]   Exactly.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.560]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it. Life comes
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.400]   at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.560]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.040]   do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.120]   delivery, take care of the supplies. All you need to come up with is the excuse
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.720]   to get together. It doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.800]   birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.200]   that you got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.960]   taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice your
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.120]   friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours. And since I know
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.800]   you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.480]   a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.200]   an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.360]   than my local liquor store. So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.800]   app or go to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today. Must be 21 plus,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.640]   not available in all locations.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.440]   That kind of comes back to this idea of trying to do two things at once. Do
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   you have a stance from all of the kind of studying you've done, people you've
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.000]   talked to, whether people can productively multitask and do email during
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.600]   a meeting or have a conversation while they clean the house, or what's your
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.400]   stance there?
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   So in general, you can't do two related things at the same time. If they're
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.560]   using kind of the same part of your brain, it will be very inefficient.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.880]   You'll just wind up switching back and forth between the two. So if you can
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.640]   check email while you're in a meeting, like, why are you in that meeting?
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.600]   Like, clearly you're not that needed in that meeting if it is possible for you
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.360]   to do this. So it would have been better on the front end to be like, "I don't
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.160]   need to be here," or "I only need to be here for the first 15 minutes," or
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.960]   something like that, rather than waste the time of acting like you're in two
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.800]   places at once. So that's for that.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.680]   Now, on the other hand, some things it doesn't really matter if we're all that
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.160]   efficient. Like, if you don't particularly care if you do the world's best job
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.280]   folding laundry and it would make it more pleasant to talk to a relative on
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.920]   the phone while you're doing it, like, that sounds great. Like, that's a great
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.520]   way to multitask. Because, yeah, it doesn't matter what your towels look
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.960]   like. You're not trying to go for the, you know, hotel crease in the towel
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   folding. So by all means, make it more pleasant. Or, you know, there's also
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.360]   ways we can kind of deepen our time by combining things, usually something
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.520]   that you are intending to do anyway, and bringing another person into it. So
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.960]   exercising with a friend, for instance, is a great way to nurture a
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.000]   relationship while also, you know, nurturing your health. Or running an
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.680]   errand with a kid. Like, if you have multiple kids, taking one on an errand
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.760]   is a great way to spend some one-on-one time together. So, yeah, these are just
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.000]   ways that you can do things with another person. And so you are, in fact,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.080]   multitasking, but in a much better way than, you know, being in an email and
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.600]   being in an email, haha, being in a meeting and checking email at the same
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.000]   time. Sometimes I feel like I'm in an email.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.720]   All the time. All the time. One tip I have for multitasking with a partner is
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.280]   make sure you're on the same page about how devoted you might be to a certain
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.480]   activity. I think for me, if I watch a television show, for me, I'm like, I
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.560]   want to be all in. I don't want to miss anything. Like, it's just really
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.680]   engaging. And sometimes my wife is like, "I just want to have a show on. And if I
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.760]   miss a piece of the show, it's not a big deal." So she's fine if she sends a text
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.600]   to her family. And it would drive me nuts because I was like, "No, why aren't
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.040]   we paying attention?" And then I was like, "Oh, you're not trying to have the
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.200]   same experience with the television as I am." And I think that's helped a bit,
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.520]   though I still have these. It's still tough, but it's helped to say, "What are
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.040]   we doing together? What are we trying to achieve?" Make sure we're on the same
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.160]   page about what we want before judging what someone else is doing. So that's
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.320]   something that I'm continuing to work on. But I think what was helpful was
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.760]   understanding what people were trying to get out of an experience before.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.560]   Yeah. I mean, although in general, I don't know. I feel like if you're watching
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.760]   something for entertainment value, I'm kind of with you. You may as well get the
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.160]   full enjoyment of it. Whereas if the goal is spending time with you, which is why
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.440]   she's sitting next to you, then maybe watching a show together isn't the best
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.600]   way to do that. Maybe you two should be interacting. And so being clear on what
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.160]   that time is and why you're spending it doing what you're doing is in general a
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.520]   good idea. I mean, yeah, you want to be good about communicating these things.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.880]   Yeah. So let's say -- which I did -- I went through, I said, "Okay, these are the
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.280]   things I want to prioritize. This is my week. How do I start getting the things
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.880]   off that aren't important?" Things like, "I have to prepare dinner. I have to
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.800]   clean the house." What are your tips for removing things that are not important?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.000]   Yeah. Well, when you don't think something is the best use of your time,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.920]   you have three options. You can ignore it, you can minimize it, and you can
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.680]   outsource it. Now, obviously, outsourcing is going to involve other people. We do
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.000]   it all the time. I mean, I've gotten all sorts of people being like, "Well, I
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.920]   can't afford to have my house cleaned," or whatever, and that's fine. But if we
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.600]   recognize that we already outsource so much -- I mean, most of us are not
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.920]   churning our own butter. We are not sewing our own clothes. So this is all
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.560]   just a matter of degree of what we choose to outsource versus what we do
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.400]   not. Then maybe people can approach it a bit more rationally and say, "Okay,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.840]   well, what are the things that would be easiest to get to somebody else that
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.200]   would cost the least amount to do?" Or if you have multiple family members,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.440]   for instance, older children, that may be a great idea for sharing the load
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.760]   there. But ignoring and minimizing are the two that really should be getting
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.200]   the bulk of the attention because there is so much that doesn't actually need
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.760]   to get done or doesn't need to get done to the standard that people might
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:01.160]   assume that it needs to. And many of these things are -- we don't even think
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.480]   about them. It's just sort of how we've grown up with the stories we have
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.800]   about what we should be doing with our time. I see this all the time on
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.560]   timelogues. People tell me, "Oh, my mother always did a small load of
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.240]   laundry every day, so I'm never behind on it." I'm like, "Wow, you are doing
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.000]   laundry every single day. And in your mind, that's what you should be doing.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.280]   That's what people do." And not even question it. Or the idea that small
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.040]   children need to be bathed nightly. If you want to, great. But they don't.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:35.320]   Unless there's a medical reason, like you've been told, it's absolutely
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.000]   critical for your child's skin condition or something. No. Most small children
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.600]   do not need that nightly. So if you don't like it, and it's not something
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.360]   that helps them sleep, and therefore you're doing it, don't. Get rid of
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.080]   that. It's fine. You don't have to do it. Packing lunches. If kids are old
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   enough to go to school where there's a cafeteria, then they can either buy or
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.960]   they can pack their own lunch. That's not something you really need to be
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:07.880]   doing. Or in general, various personal care things. I mean, I'm glad we're not
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.440]   sharing too much of the video of this, but I try to minimize how much personal
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.400]   care you do as well. And I'm sure some of your female listeners may get more
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.000]   of this than maybe all your male listeners, but many of the beauty
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.400]   standards aimed at women seem to assume that we just have all the time in the
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.240]   world to devote to these things. I occasionally read these articles in
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   women's magazines, like, "How to do an eight-minute face and save tons of
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.720]   time." I'm like, "Eight minutes? Really? Are we supposed to be spending eight
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.520]   minutes on makeup every day? How about 30 seconds? Can we just do that? Would
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.880]   that be better?" There's people who won't face the world unless their hair
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.320]   is perfectly coiffed and blown out. It takes time. And we should really
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.160]   question, "Is that necessary?" I think we've learned in the past year, so many
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   of us working from home, that a lot of this is maybe less necessary than
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.640]   we may have thought. So, ignore and minimize as much as possible when
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.560]   something is not the best use of your time.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.080]   One of the tips you mentioned at the end of your book was not to overthink
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.480]   dinner. And I feel like when I first read that, my instinct was, "Well, yeah,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.920]   you could just order dinner or get microwave meals, but I would be curious
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.320]   if that's the actual process you follow, or how do you have healthy meals
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.080]   without spending an hour sitting there preparing and chopping and all that?"
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.000]   Yeah, this is another one that really gets me, because I know that a lot of
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   people grow up with the message that if you are going to get your family ready
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.080]   for the week, you need to spend all Sunday prepping meals for the week
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.560]   ahead. And what happens is that people spend all this time preparing meals,
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.920]   and then they still spend time getting them ready during the week. It's like,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.880]   "Because I've got to thaw the lasagna, and then let me make a salad to go with
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.160]   the lasagna that's pre-made." It's like, you're still spending 20-30 minutes
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.800]   getting dinner on the table. It's like, "Well, you could actually do a whole
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.960]   dinner in 20-30 minutes, right? You can pick up a rotisserie chicken in a bag
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.720]   salad. That's made. You don't even have to do anything." But even if you're
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.560]   cooking, I mean, you could just throw some veggies and make an omelet with
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   scrambled eggs. That's dinner. That is like a quick-cooking piece of salmon
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.680]   and some veggies on a sheet pan in the oven, 20 minutes or so. Again, not
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:28.120]   overthinking it. There are all sorts of incredibly simple meals, and having a
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.680]   few of these available to you and always having the ingredients for these things
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:39.800]   on hand can make life a lot easier. Having rotating dinners, like the idea of
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.120]   Taco Tuesday is really brilliant, if you think about it. Because if it's Tuesday,
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   you're having tacos. And you can switch it up within that. Like, "I don't know.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.200]   This week, it's chicken tacos. Next week, it's steak tacos or shrimp tacos or
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.560]   whatever." Or you put different toppings on week to week, and people choose their
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.400]   own. But you always have the stuff for tacos when you go to the grocery store,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.720]   and then you never think about it, because it's Tuesday, and you're having
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:07.480]   tacos. And that removes a lot of mental energy and allows you to just do what
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.640]   else you're doing until it's time to have dinner.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:15.800]   Yeah. I think one of the best things to save time on dinner for us this past
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.040]   year, where there's been a lot of cooking at home, was we just found some
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.320]   meals that we're like, "You know what? We could eat this every week." And the
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.040]   coolest thing is not only does it take out the overhead of "What are we eating
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.840]   this week?" to reduce that, but also, we've ended up just basically memorizing
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.120]   these recipes such that you can do it completely on autopilot. You're like, "I
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.240]   know exactly what needs to be chopped." I started to figure out, "Oh, well, we
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.760]   need these ingredients for these two things. So let's batch those together
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.920]   back at night after night." And then we also just started doubling every dinner
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.440]   so that we didn't have to think about lunch.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.600]   Yeah. Leftovers are great. I mean, leftovers are wonderful. I said, "Don't
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.240]   make all your meals on Sunday." But whenever you are cooking something, if
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.480]   you make enough for the next day to have lunch, then you've solved two meals at
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.920]   once. So that's great.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:07.880]   Yeah. Exactly. So, okay. So now we've got this week that we know what we want
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.000]   to do. We've taken off the things we don't want to do. Actually, I have one
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.480]   last one on the last one, which is, are there... I know you said that minimizing
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.160]   and ignoring can be the most powerful. But when it comes to outsourcing, are
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.080]   there things that are less obvious that you think people could benefit from
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.280]   considering outsourcing?
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:32.120]   Well, I think that food prep is something that might be more worth outsourcing
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:39.560]   than many people consider. If it is a source of stress in your household, like
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.200]   who's making dinner. If you have some sort of child care, for instance, like
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.240]   if this is the situation people are in because they have young kids and two
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.400]   working parents, if perhaps a babysitter could start dinner, that would save you
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.880]   various time, you know, before you get home from work. Or if the meals can be
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.040]   pre-prepped during a toddler's nap time, for instance, that could be one way to
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.880]   take it off your plate, so to speak, for a few nights a week. So that's something
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:14.600]   that many people don't do, but can in fact be a real benefit. I mean, more than
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.200]   like having a cleaning service come in to dust your baseboards. Like, I mean, you
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.480]   can just not dust the baseboards. That's another idea. Whereas you do have to eat.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.920]   So if that is the source of stress and you don't want to be doing takeout all
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.800]   the time, it may actually be something that would be available as part of
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.840]   child care. Or, I mean, heck, hire somebody to come in and cook for you a
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.080]   couple times a week. It might, in fact, be cheaper than restaurant meals and
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.400]   takeout if you run the numbers on it. And that could solve that problem.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:51.640]   Yeah. Someone just sent me a site called chef.com, but chef with an S. And it's
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.360]   kind of like not quite meal delivery where you, you know, you could do it on
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.000]   the night of. You say, okay, next Friday, I want to order from this person who
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.200]   lives in your kind of vicinity, who's going to cook, in this case, like Persian
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.040]   food. And you pick your meal and they deliver it at much less than you would
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.080]   pay from a restaurant because you're planning in advance. They're going to
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.640]   make this for lots of people. It's actually person to person, not necessarily
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.480]   restaurants. And it's something that I've queued up to do next week is to have
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.560]   two or three meals delivered in advance. And we'll see how that goes.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.680]   Yeah. That sounds like a great idea. Look forward to hearing how it works.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   That would certainly be an option for people as well.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   Yeah. I'll link it out in the show notes because it is not spelled as it
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.120]   sounds. So if I've decided the things that I want to prioritize and I've
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.880]   decided the things that I want to deprioritize, I've kind of have a plan.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.680]   Is there a good time to do that planning? Is there a good way to stick to those
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.240]   routines?
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.520]   So I think that weekly planning will get most of the job done for most
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:04.280]   people. I plan my weeks on Fridays. I find that Friday is a really good week,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.320]   good day to make this happen because it tends to be slower. It's also really
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.120]   hard to start anything new on Friday, kind of like drifting into the weekend
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.360]   by Friday afternoon. So we have a tendency to waste a lot of time on Fridays.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.760]   Whereas if you spend the time planning what future you should be doing, you
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.680]   turn what might be wasted time into some of your most productive minutes of the
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.640]   week. So Friday, usually Friday afternoon, I make a three-category priority
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.880]   list for my upcoming week. Career, relationships, self. The same three
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.800]   categories we talked about before. What would I most like to accomplish in
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.680]   these categories over the course of the next week? I make that list, figure out
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.840]   roughly when those things can go, look at what is already on my calendar for
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.120]   the upcoming week, figure out any logistics that need to happen, or if I
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.360]   want to ignore or minimize or get rid of something, how I could do that for
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.960]   what is already on my calendar. And this whole process takes 20 minutes, maybe.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.680]   And I say that as somebody with a family of two working parents, five kids, a
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.840]   dog, a lot of logistics around here. I think, you know, many people are like,
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.400]   "Oh, I'm too tired on Friday to plan." It's like, really? Like, what do you
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.440]   think it looks like? I mean, it's not running a marathon. Like, we're talking
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.280]   20 minutes max where you think about your upcoming week. But if you do this
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.160]   week after week, then you start to get a much better sense of control of your
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.320]   time. Like, you know what is coming up. You know you have a plan to deal with it.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.080]   And that can make your weekends far better, too, because part of that Sunday
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.000]   night blues people experience is that they know there's a lot of stuff waiting
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.600]   for the Monday, like, professionally, probably personally, too. And they don't
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.320]   know what they're going to do about it. So their brain is going over and over
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.280]   again trying to figure out, "What am I going to do about it?" But if you know,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.240]   because you had a plan that you made on Friday, then you can relax.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:57.000]   And what about weekends? It was really exciting to read -- because I'd never
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.480]   done the math -- that there are 60 hours between cracking a beer on Friday
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.720]   afternoon and going to work on Monday. Do you plan those weekends on Friday
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.480]   night? Or are they part of the previous week's plan? How do you make weekends
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.440]   the best they can be? So usually they are part of the previous Friday. So I
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:20.200]   kind of view my Friday planning as mostly looking to the upcoming week. The
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.680]   upcoming week being Monday through that Sunday. However, because I am planning
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.760]   on Friday, it allows me to take a second glance at what is on the calendar for
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.960]   that upcoming weekend. And so if I haven't sorted something through, that's a
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.320]   last-minute chance to do it. Or if the weather has changed or something new has
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.960]   come up, that allows me to also take a secondary look at the weekend that is
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.840]   just starting. And, you know, other people may not need to do it that way.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.720]   Again, because of the five children, two working parents. Like, I cannot let the
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:41:00.360]   weekend just be until last-minute Friday night, because there might be three
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.120]   children in different sporting activities at different places. And if
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.240]   there's only two drivers, well, we've got to sort something out. So other people
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:14.120]   might not need to do that. But I do. So that's where that comes in. But I would
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.920]   say you do need to plan your weekends. I think a lot of people are like, "Oh,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.680]   planning weekend. That's totally a contradiction in terms. That sounds
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.720]   terrible. Horrible. I don't want to do that." Okay. That is fine. But if you just
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.000]   think of a few what I call "anchor events." Like, things that would be exciting to
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.120]   you to do over the course of the weekend. And when roughly you think those should
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.720]   go. Like, three things over the course of the weekend that would genuinely
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.960]   excite you or rejuvenate you. You will have so much better weekends. Because the
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.400]   rest of the time can be whatever. I mean, not nothing. It's impossible to do
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.440]   nothing. You'll do something. It just may not be what you would have chosen if
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.200]   you thought about it. But if you know you have these three anchor things in your
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   weekend, you will hit Monday feeling like, "Yeah. That was great."
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.880]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.840]   Yeah. You mentioned putting together your list of either 100 or 1,000 dreams. I
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.600]   guess it depends on the person on how many they want.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.240]   1,000. That's too many.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.880]   1,000 is probably too many.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.960]   That's ambitious. 1 million dreams.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.640]   Yeah. But how... I found that doing that makes it easier to plan the weekend. So
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.320]   having a list of things that you want to do that are exciting, whether that's
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.400]   restaurants to go try now that we're opening things back up, whether that's
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.960]   hikes you want to go on, or a museum to see. And so I love that idea.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.680]   I started batching mine together and separating it from what's usually often
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.720]   thought of as my bucket list, which is like, "I want to go to Greece," which is
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.160]   not something I'm going to do next weekend.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.440]   You're not going to do this weekend.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.200]   Yeah. Well, the upside of... It's a list of 100 dreams, which was... It was an
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.720]   exercise shared with me by a career coach great many years ago. And a lot of
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.320]   people have really responded well to this idea. You can do 1,000. That'd be
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.400]   great, too. But people will find that even 100 is really, really hard. Because
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.520]   the bucket list that you're talking about, it is stuff like, "Go to Greece."
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.640]   And then you get 20 places you want to visit. And then you're like, "Huh. Okay.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.080]   Now what?" And so with 100, you have to keep going. And so you can list the
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.680]   dozen local restaurants you want to try. And then you're still only at 32 items.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.800]   And so then you're like, "Okay. Well, here's these 15 state parks within 2-hour
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.360]   drive that I want to go see." And you're only at 47. So you still have to keep
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.520]   coming back to this list over and over again and asking friends and family what
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.560]   they recommend. But having made this long and unedited list of anything you might
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.360]   want to do does make future planning easier. Because then you say like, "Oh,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.280]   well, we do have half a weekend day on this upcoming Saturday. And, oh, hey, I
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.440]   want to do strawberry picking with the kids. And it's strawberry season. We
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.400]   should do that." Right? Whereas if you haven't articulated that desire, it may
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.800]   not occur to you to be like, "Oh, yes. We should go strawberry picking with this
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.200]   few hours we have until it's, you know, strawberry season has come and gone."
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:27.320]   Yeah. One other weekend, I guess, hack that I've started using already is you
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.240]   said, "If you use weekends for chores, it's less ideal. Because if you use
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.760]   weekdays for chores, you'll spend less time on them because you just have less
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.960]   time." I thought this was great. So we just started saying, "Let's do all our
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.200]   chores on the weekdays. And then they won't expand to fill the entire weekend."
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.280]   So that hack, I thought, is worth sharing.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.800]   Okay, good. Well, I'm glad you like that. I mean, yeah, if you have the ability
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.760]   to, you know, well, obviously, people can order groceries, too. But if you're
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.360]   going to go to a store, I mean, there's nobody in the store at like 930 on
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Wednesday. So if that's an option, you have young kids, one parent stays home
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.560]   with them, and the other goes to the store. Like, you can be in and out so
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.240]   quick because there's no line, nothing going on there. So that works.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.360]   And everything is stocked.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.720]   And everything is stocked. That's true, too. You know, yeah, I've gone at like
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.960]   5am once when I got up early with the baby. And it was like, "This is the
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.720]   magical time at the 24-hour store where everything is there. I'm the only
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:25.000]   person here." It's great. But yeah, doing things at unorthodox times, if you
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.440]   think about when would everybody do something and then do it at another time,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.960]   you can generally save a lot of time because you won't be having to deal with
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.080]   everyone else being there.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.320]   Same thing with like, you know, throw a load of laundry in in the morning, move
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.000]   it into the dryer. If you're working at home, do it at lunch. But if you're not,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.800]   just do it when you get home from work later in the day. It's like, do that
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.160]   twice a week. And then you don't have to spend your Saturday by the laundry
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.680]   machine. And that's great.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:54.680]   You can just do quick touch-ups. If you are making dinner, for instance, and
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.520]   you're cleaning the kitchen, like, you know, say, "Okay, we're going to get
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.120]   this kitchen clean in, say, the next 15 minutes." And just do a quick sweep
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.640]   through of everything else, the common areas. Do that once or twice a week, the
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.240]   extra stuff. And again, you don't have to spend the whole weekend cleaning as
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   well while you are maintaining at least a reasonably clean home. People have
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.960]   very different standards of what constitutes clean. And if you are a
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.160]   person for whom it has to be spotless, like, you just have to acknowledge that
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.520]   either that's going to take a ton of time or a ton of money. Whereas if you
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.360]   can allow yourself to lower your standards a bit, then that can save a lot
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.160]   of time and money. So, you know, figure out what's worth it.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.920]   I thought that tip was great. I proposed lowering our housekeeping standards,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.960]   but it did not go well.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.680]   It did not go well. There are certain, yes, gendered aspects to this. It is
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.920]   often harder for women to let go of housekeeping standards because it has
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.680]   been drilled into our heads that that is what people will judge us on. And I
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:56.120]   even once heard this articulated that somebody had been told, like, "You think
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.480]   you're such hot stuff, but there is dust under your beds." Like, I just love
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:06.920]   that. Like, who would say that? But somebody did to somebody. But that's
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.160]   what people have in the back of their minds. So, you know, it might help to
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.240]   realize that many of us don't have all that many other people in our house
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.760]   these days anyway. And if you were going to have people in your house, you
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   could deal with it. Like, you could do a quick hour blitz and get through it.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.560]   Like, you'd probably have notice. Like, not that many of us have these
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.040]   situations where judgmental people are showing up at our house with no notice
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.240]   to come inspect under our beds. So, for most of us, there's no home inspection
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.280]   coming up. Like, a lot of people will be like, "Oh, I can't go to -- I have to
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.840]   clean the house before I go to bed at night." It's like, "Well, why? You know,
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.920]   is there an 11 p.m. home inspection?" Like, no. There is no 11 p.m. home
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.840]   inspection. Nobody is coming to give you demerits for having toys on the floor.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   And in fact, those toys will just come out again next morning. So, you'll never
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.400]   get that time back.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.360]   Oh, yes. They come out every day.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.000]   They come out every day.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.800]   So, I feel like -- and maybe this is a result of, you know, a young child in
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.240]   the house. But sometimes, at the end of the week, my wife and I are like, "What
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.320]   do we want to do this weekend?" And we're like, "I just don't want to do
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:13.000]   anything." I feel like we did so much and we didn't stop for a second. What do
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.200]   you do when you have those feelings? Or how have you avoided having those
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.000]   feelings?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.680]   Well, the one thing I would say is that having time at home with no plans with a
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:29.560]   small child is often way more exhausting than getting out and doing something. And
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.800]   I have learned this in many cases the hard way, that if there are a bunch of
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   kids arguing and fighting and throwing things around all Saturday morning, it
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.560]   feels hellish. Whereas if we go to the zoo, people have other things to look at
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.320]   to direct their energy. And rather than punching your sister, you can look at
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.640]   the monkeys. And then you come home at lunch, and then people can have quiet
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.720]   time afterwards because they're tired, or the people who nap can nap. And then
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.200]   go out again at 3.30, 4.00, do something little then, and then the day is over.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:06.120]   And that is a much better way to manage your energy than facing 12 hours of
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   nothingness on a Saturday, which won't be nothing. It'll be you guys chasing
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.880]   around the 10-month-old and trying to keep the 10-month-old from sticking a
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.960]   -- was it a boy or a girl? Sorry.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.760]   A girl.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.560]   A girl. Keep her from sticking a fork in her eye. And then be like, "Well, I
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.000]   had -- I was with her more during this amount of time, and you were with her
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.920]   more for this amount of time." Yeah, it's just -- have a plan. It's so much
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.120]   better for managing energy.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:36.200]   So, we talked a lot about weekends. One of the books that I did read before
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.360]   this was about what the most successful people do before breakfast. Could you
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.280]   talk a little bit about what you've learned about mornings and why they can
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.160]   be so valuable?
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:51.320]   So, mornings are a really good time for getting stuff done. For people who
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:56.760]   have traditional in-the-office jobs and particularly who have families who are
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.800]   going to need and want to see them after work, morning is another chunk of the
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.080]   day that can be discretionary time. There's that time, and then there's the
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.880]   late-at-night time. The problem is that the late-at-night time is harder to use
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.840]   for certain sorts of activities. Like, most people are not going to leave the
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.640]   house and go for a run at 9 p.m. Most people do not have the energy to write a
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.920]   chapter in their novel at 10 p.m. Now, there are some people who do. That's
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.120]   great. More power to them. Most people are not going to be able to do that, and
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.200]   that's why we tend to do the more low-energy stuff at night. Whereas
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.240]   morning, most people have more discipline and energy and focus in the
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.840]   morning. Again, not everybody, but most people. And so, if that sounds like it
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.640]   might be you, figuring out that there is something that you would like to do,
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.200]   that life has a way of crowding out, maybe you can make time for it in the
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.240]   morning. And so, I kept seeing this on time logs. Like, if there was somebody
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.800]   who had a huge job and a family they were raising, and then they also, you
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.880]   know, exercised five times a week, or they also, you know, had a great
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.560]   meditation practice or a spiritual practice they were doing frequently, or
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.400]   who, you know, was doing creative writing or some sort of hobby like that, it
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.840]   tended to be that they were doing it first thing in the morning. And so, I
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.200]   started seeing this over and over again on time logs and decided I had to
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.160]   investigate further.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:20.120]   And have you had mornings yourself? I know I have, where you wake up and
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.800]   you're just like, "Gosh, I wanted to get up at six. I just feel awful." Like,
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.400]   can you jumpstart that productivity? Or is that a day where you just say, "Today,
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.240]   I'm just going to give myself another hour of sleep"?
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.480]   Well, usually that's a decision that could be made the night before. Because
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.640]   the reason you feel bad waking up at six a.m. often has to do with what time you
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.280]   went to bed the night before. So, this is just math. Like, if you need seven
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.480]   and a half hours of sleep and you're in a position which, again, you may not be
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.240]   with a ten-month-old baby, but let's say that's not part of your life at the
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.800]   moment, you, you know, if you're waking up at six and you went to bed at
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.040]   eleven-thirty, well, that's six and a half hours. So, that explains why you are
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.800]   tired at six a.m. Whereas, if you went to bed at ten-thirty, then you would
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.920]   have gotten your seven and a half hours, and you probably would feel pretty good
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.360]   at six a.m. But you can then make that decision the night before if you have
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.080]   any sort of control over when you can get up in the morning. It's like, "Well,
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.400]   I didn't get to bed until eleven-thirty, so I actually do need to sleep until
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.080]   closer to seven, if that is at all possible in my life." So, I really do
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   think that, that the wake-up decision should be a function of when you went to
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   bed, as opposed to being like, "No, no, no. I have to do X at six a.m." And
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.040]   then you'll just crash the next night and not be able to do anything, too. I
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.640]   mean, people, people will get to the amount of sleep they need. The question
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   is whether it is disorderly or orderly, and it's much better in our life if it's
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.000]   a more orderly matter. Yeah. And, and part of recreating mornings, which is
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.960]   something I'm kind of trying to do, you know, it's like, "Okay, we're going to
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.440]   introduce exercise. That's a new routine." Not that I have an exercise, but in the
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:57.160]   mornings as frequently and consistently. Any tips for when you're trying to
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:02.680]   introduce new habits? Well, start small. I also think that, for many people, it
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.880]   would help to not view the morning routine as something they need to do
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.800]   every single day. And, and there may be people who disagree with me, because
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.600]   they're like, "It's a routine." But I've found, over the years of talking to
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.000]   people, that many people do not do their same morning routines on, say, Saturday
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.760]   and Sunday, and they don't do it on vacations. And if you're not doing it on
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.000]   those days, then it isn't, in fact, a daily routine. It is a five-times-a-week
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.880]   routine, or maybe even a four-times-a-week, if they're only doing it Monday to
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.240]   Thursday, because Friday is different for some reason. So, a lot of these people
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:36.440]   with "daily routines"—I'm putting "daily" in my quote marks—are doing it four
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:40.520]   times a week. So, if you want to aim for three to four times a week, that's great.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.560]   That can still count as a routine. And then, that also makes it possible for
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.000]   people who need to trade off with a partner in terms of, like, kid coverage in
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.280]   the morning. Like, you know, "I'm going to exercise three times a week in the
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.000]   morning. You're going to exercise two to three times a week in the morning." It's
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.120]   fine. You can trade off for each other. Start small. Like, do something that you
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:08.280]   will enjoy and that you will stick with. So, if you hate running, don't choose
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.040]   running as your morning routine exercise, because you will not get out of bed to
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.840]   do it. Whereas, if you love it, then you will. If you prefer to do an exercise
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.000]   video or lift weights or, you know, get on your Peloton bike, or maybe there's a
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.160]   class you love to go to at 6 a.m. two days a week. Like, those are the sorts of
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.520]   things people will stick with. But if it's like, "I have to exercise, and I have
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.400]   to do X that I hate, but I'm just going to power through it." It's like, "Okay.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:36.440]   Well, you will for a few days. And then, something will happen to derail you, and
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.280]   you won't get back into it, because you don't want to do it."
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:43.480]   Yeah. One of the things that I think gets a lot of people in the morning is, you
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.000]   know, your phone's right there, and all of a sudden, you're looking at your email,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.320]   and you're not getting out of bed to do the exercise. You even love and want. So,
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.080]   one thing that I've tried to do, and it works sometimes, and then I fall out of
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.000]   it, but is I just try to plug my phone in somewhere where I have to get out of bed
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.080]   to grab it. It doesn't have to be the, "I leave it in the kitchen." But it's like,
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.760]   I have to stand up. And once I'm standing up, I'm like, "I should probably use this
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.240]   time to go on a run. I'm already out of bed."
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:15.000]   But the nights where the phone just ends up on the nightstand, the next morning, I
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.480]   feel like I instantly lose 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.560]   Yeah, that can definitely happen. And it's so easy to look and check. So, if you need
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.440]   to check the weather, but still, you're just like, "Oh, but it's right there. I
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:34.040]   could just look so easily." So, yeah, doing as much as you can to keep yourself
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.400]   on your routine. Probably whatever it is can be dealt with after you've gone and
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.960]   exercised for 20, 30 minutes, too. So, you might even just stick the phone in your
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.200]   pocket in case there's an emergency, but not look at it.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.880]   Yeah. And we talked about 168 hours. A lot of them are sleeping. A lot of them,
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.320]   hopefully, we can redefine after this. But a lot of them are at work. And I'm curious,
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.760]   are there --especially in light of lots of work from home and your new book, The New
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.880]   Corner Office last year-- are there common tips people should take to work with them
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.200]   for better productively managing their workdays?
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:13.560]   Well, I think being mindful about time is important for leisure time and it's
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.960]   important for work time. Now, in terms of work time, people do think about their
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.640]   time because we have appointments we have to do, we have things we have to accomplish,
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.200]   and those can make time feel bigger than it is, which is one of the reasons that people
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   think they work more hours than they tend to. But on any given day, think like, "Well,
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:37.160]   what would make for a good day? What three to five things do I really need to accomplish
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.560]   today?" That can be your to-do list for the day. And then when you've done those
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.680]   things, you know you've had a good day. I mean, maybe other things happen, maybe
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:51.400]   other things don't. But by setting limited but well-chosen goals for any given day,
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   you can make progress and you can feel accomplished. And then you know when things
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.360]   will be done because you view your to-do list as a contract with yourself. I mean,
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:06.920]   I think that's one of the key things, is that we do each day what we set out to do.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.120]   And yes, stuff comes up, which is why you have to make the list of things you
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   absolutely will get to very, very short. But when you choose them well, then you will make progress.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:22.920]   Yeah. I just listened to the episode of your podcast where you talk about email. And I saw
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.120]   that you wrote a review in the Wall Street Journal for Cal Newport's "A World Without Email" book.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:36.040]   I feel like email, like I know you do, is this thing that sucks up all time. Are there a couple
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.840]   quick tips or hacks about how to rethink about email so it doesn't end up eating your whole day?
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:46.520]   Yeah. I enjoyed Cal's book. I mean, I think we're not going to have a world without email,
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:52.120]   but I think a world with a lot less email is within our ability to get. And some of this
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:57.160]   is organizational. If you work for yourself, then you can set your own parameters on it. I
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.760]   tend to just not check it for a while if I don't want to check it. And that's fine. Nothing's
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:06.200]   really... Nobody can do anything to me. But yeah, if you work in an organization, you really need to
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:13.000]   set these parameters as a group and come up with ways to not be sending each other random emails
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.920]   back and forth constantly. Maybe it's that you do short check-ins on the status of things. Maybe it's
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.280]   that you use project management software. Maybe it's that you tell people to pick up the phone.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.400]   It's a crazy idea. But that's often a much more efficient way to get a bit of information than
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:36.920]   having like a 12 email back and forth chain. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to reduce my email time
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:41.880]   because it's just... It's taking over. Okay. Last big thing I want to talk about.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:47.160]   So I have this 10-month-old and you've gone through five children. And I know that you've
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:53.080]   learned a lot. Is there... Obviously, I feel like I've lost a lot of time and I've gained a lot of
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:58.600]   happiness. But are there hacks you have for managing time with kids that a new parent should
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:05.400]   really be thinking about? Well, I think it's the same mindfulness that we've been talking in all
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:10.920]   other aspects of life that you think about your days ahead of time, you think about what would
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.840]   make for good additions to your life, like things you want to do with your kids when you can make
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:24.920]   those happen. And it's... I think entering the kids' worlds from time to time and certainly as
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:30.200]   they get older, you start to see more of the things that they are really interested in. And
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.800]   it doesn't take much time. But having little bits of time that you are devoted fully to those things
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:43.480]   that they are interested in can be some of the more fun parts of parenting. I've done... Every
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:48.040]   summer, I try to do what we call "Mommy Days" with each of my kids. I take my older kids. Each
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:52.520]   kid gets a one-on-one day with me. We go do something that the kid really wanted to do.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.400]   And it's just so pleasant because they're not fighting with some other kid about like,
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.720]   "Who gets to do what?" And "I wanted to do this, but we did this. And so now I have to do this."
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.360]   And so you can't do it all the time. I mean, I wouldn't claim that people who are only children,
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.800]   it's like all of life is like that because it isn't because their parents get exhausted with
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:17.240]   just dealing with them. But when we are managing a crowd, we are having just little bits of time
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.560]   focused on each kid can be great. And I sort of try to think about my weeks that way, too. Like,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.880]   have I built in some small chunk of time with each kid one-on-one with them? And if I have,
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.040]   then it's been good. So trying to take advantage of that as much as possible.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.720]   Yeah. And the last thing you said about kids that really stuck with me is that part of making over
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:43.160]   your mornings has been investing time to make your children more self-reliant. Are there tips
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.400]   for helping make children more self-reliant? They might not be relevant at 10 months, but...
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.880]   No, if you're 10 months old, it's not going to be that self-reliant. You shouldn't hold it against
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.600]   her. But as she gets older, things you've done that have helped there?
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:05.400]   Well, I think just expecting them to do... I think the more you kind of do for your kids,
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.360]   the more they then expect you to do that for them. So I'm certainly not the kind of person
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:16.600]   who chooses my kids' outfits. I feel like that's your business. Your fashion statement's not my
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.880]   problem. It has nothing to do with me. If you wear something like... I mean, I'll stop you if
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.000]   it's 30 degrees out and you're leaving without a coat. But other than that, kind of your call.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.360]   Having kids learn how to make lunches. For instance, when we were doing hybrid and virtual
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.560]   schooling for a long time, there was definitely lessons on how you get your own food because I
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.960]   can't make lunch for everyone every day. We're working on various things in terms of getting
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.560]   clothes put away and helping with household chores and managing your own schoolwork. I definitely
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:55.720]   think that's something that you just have to decide as a parent. Like, I already did sixth
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:03.000]   grade. I don't need to do sixth grade again. And if things go wrong in sixth grade, it won't be the
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.560]   end of the world and they will learn from it. So that's generally been my philosophy. Hopefully,
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:17.400]   it won't go horribly wrong, but we'll see. That's the one thing. I don't like to give a whole lot of
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:24.440]   parenting advice, I'd have to say, because I feel like it's just asking for your kid to do
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.760]   something terrible. And it'd be like, "That person claimed to be a parenting expert." And you have no
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:37.320]   control over it, ultimately. I mean, people are their own people and they make their own choices
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.760]   in life, ultimately. And so you just have to do your best to make sure everything goes well.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:51.160]   That's what we're trying. Any other fun life or money or any kind of hacks that you love
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.360]   that you want to share? I know you said it's not about getting back those 5-10 minutes here and
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:02.520]   there, but it is something that I know listeners love to hear. Any tricks to feel more optimized
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.040]   and efficient? Well, one thing I would say is that
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:12.760]   hunting for lost items feels like the biggest waste of time in the world. So as much as possible,
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.720]   having a set location for anything you use frequently, and if it is ever found not in that
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.840]   location, it needs to be immediately returned. So all my kids' shoes, backpacks, coats, sports
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:33.640]   equipment are in the mudroom. They don't have to be nicely lined up. This isn't something you'll
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.120]   see on Pinterest. But if shoes are ever found elsewhere, they are immediately returned there.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.080]   And so that way you're not spending 10 minutes every morning looking for shoes, which if we
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:51.400]   were doing would just make life impossible. So find a home for spots, find a home for things,
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.880]   keep them in that spot, train everyone that it never goes anywhere else, and hopefully you'll
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.920]   spend a lot less time looking for stuff. Great. This has been fantastic. Thank you
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:06.520]   so much for being here. Where can people read more, learn more about you and everything you're
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.080]   learning? Yeah, well, please come visit my website, which is lauravandercam.com. You
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.640]   can learn about my various books there and about my podcasts. I have Before Breakfast,
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.080]   which is an every weekday morning short productivity tip to help you take your day
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.880]   from great to awesome. I also have a podcast I co-host with Sarah Hart Unger called Best of Both
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:29.080]   Worlds about the intersection of work and family from the perspective of two people who really
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.760]   enjoy both. So that airs every Tuesday. Awesome. Thank you for being here.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.800]   Thanks so much for having me.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:42.760]   I really hope you enjoyed that and thank you for listening. I've been tracking my time for
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.640]   the past week and it's been really eye-opening. I'm already starting to minimize, ignore and
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.120]   outsource things to be more intentional. Unfortunately, that means more time for
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.960]   all the hacks. So I'm excited to see where this goes. If you're enjoying the show,
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.840]   you can always help out by sharing an episode with a friend or leaving a 5-star review.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.760]   I know I say it every time, but the more this show grows, the more incredible guests I'll be
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.640]   able to have on and the more hacks we can all learn together. So thank you in advance for all
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:15.240]   your help. If you want to get in touch, I'm Chris@allthehacks.com and @Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:28.200]   See you next time.
