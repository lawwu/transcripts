[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.360]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.640]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.800]   Today on the show, I want to share with you some of our exciting plans for this year,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.120]   my family's plans for these coming at least six months, although time will tell.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.040]   To cut straight to it, we're going traveling again.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.600]   At the moment as I speak to you, my house is full of boxes, stuff is flowing out the
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   doors.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.240]   We are in the process of minimizing and downsizing once again.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.160]   We've been living in a rented house for quite a while now, for the last couple of years,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.200]   and we are getting rid of all of our stuff yet again, keeping just a few things, the
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.460]   important things in life, you know, books and more books and more books, keeping books,
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.960]   but otherwise getting rid of all of our personal possessions and downsizing for our family
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.120]   of six down into just a handful of suitcases again so that we can hit the road.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.000]   And in this next month, in May, at the beginning of May, we will be traveling full time.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.240]   We're, again, getting rid of our house, hopping on an airplane.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.880]   We're going to begin in the Americas.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.360]   In May, we will be in Mexico.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.480]   In April, we will be in Costa Rica.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.740]   In June, we will be in the United States of America.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.760]   And in July, we'll see.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.520]   We are planning to head to Europe, but of course, there's still some uncertainty there
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.840]   given all of the European travel restrictions.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   But this summer, and so I can't tell you exactly the countries, but this summer, we intend
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.840]   to spend some time in Europe, spend some time in Portugal, hopefully in France, in Spain,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.160]   going to go check out Malta, going to go to some in Eastern Europe, planning to go to
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   Serbia, then some of the Balkan countries, possibly along the coast, Croatia, Montenegro.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.720]   We may go from there to Georgia and Armenia.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.120]   I'm interested in what's happening in Georgia and Armenia, possibly Azerbaijan.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.960]   From there, we may go on and spend more time in Europe, or we might head to Asia via India.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.720]   I'd like to go to India and spend some time looking around for opportunities in India.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   This fall, I would like to be in Asia.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.440]   So specifically, we'll see.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   But Hong Kong, Singapore, looking for investment opportunities, finance opportunities, may
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.120]   go to Malaysia, to Cambodia, to Vietnam.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.600]   And then at this point in time, we'll see.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720]   And of course, all this is subject to a number of things.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.640]   We may pop down to Indonesia, pop into Australia, maybe go to New Zealand, or we might not.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   We'll see.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   So the reason I'm being a little bit cagey is simply that I don't even have tickets yet,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.560]   and the world situation is still somewhat unknown.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.160]   We're dealing with the kind of the back end of a global pandemic.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.880]   We're dealing with some tight lockdowns and travel restrictions in some of those places,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.200]   and so that can make immigration, traveling places, tourist difficult.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   And then of course, also, I need to be cautious and careful about what my family can handle.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   My wife and I are not strangers to travel, even to extended travel.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.320]   In 2018, we did this already.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   We got rid of all of our stuff and hopped in an RV and spent six months traveling around
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.840]   the United States.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.720]   And on that trip, we also didn't have a specific timeline.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.120]   We didn't know if we're going to go for three months.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.600]   We didn't know if we're going to go for a year.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   But we wound up conceiving a baby, and so we needed to be stationary for a time when
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.200]   the baby was going to come along.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.840]   That was what ended our trip then, and we decided to leave the United States too.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.200]   So things can happen.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.040]   My biggest concern in terms of timeline is just how are my children going to respond.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   I think that they'll do okay.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.000]   We have some experience traveling, and so I think they'll do okay.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.640]   But it might be that they feel displaced.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.240]   They may not feel secure if we're moving around all the time.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.120]   And if as a father, I see that, then I want to be free to change and adjust because I
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.080]   do have young children, and I need to make sure that they're healthy and doing really
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   well.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.200]   And so we'll see, but that's our tentative plan.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.600]   And so how does that involve you?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.440]   Well, first of all, I'd like to share a couple of lessons with you and then share how you
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560]   can get connected and keep pace with us on these journeys.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.720]   First lesson I'd like to share with you is simply this.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   It's only hard until you've done it.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.060]   Or related to that, it's only scary until you've done it.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.200]   We are in the midst of doing something that is for most normal, sane people, scary and
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   difficult.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.880]   Getting rid of all of your stuff, getting rid of your house, and packing your young,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.100]   large family into suitcases is for any normal, sane person, scary and difficult.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.440]   But while it's not easy, and it's not without some cautiousness on my part, I don't think
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.360]   of it now as scary and as difficult.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.200]   I want to tell you why that is, and it's simply this.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   It's because I've done it.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   I did it.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.600]   I did it in 2018.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.800]   And I've done it in testing different ways, different times along the way.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.000]   I've tested so much of this that for me, what we're doing, which is certainly the stuff
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   of dreams for many people, doesn't feel all that scary and all that difficult, because
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.160]   I've tested it in micro doses.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.760]   And I believe that this is a strategy that you can implement into your life if there
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.920]   are plans and things that you want to do, that you would like to do, to make things
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.780]   less scary and difficult.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.000]   The first is to be willing to dream big dreams, and be clear on what you want to do and how
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.840]   you want to live.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.320]   But if you have a dream and you have a goal, recognize that it's going to be scary and
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.240]   difficult until you do it.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.720]   And there's no easy way around it.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.200]   You have to do it.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.620]   But as you do it, it will become easier.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.160]   So let's start with a little bit of backstory.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.520]   First of all, over the years, my wife and I have traveled in a number of different ways,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.040]   and we've proven to ourselves that we can be happy, that we can have a good relationship,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.120]   that we're both pretty low maintenance, and that we can do it in all kinds of different
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   ways.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   Over the years, we've slept in cars, we've slept in tents, we've had nice hotel rooms,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.320]   we've rented luxury villas, we've had big, fancy, expensive experiences, and we've had
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.960]   poor person experiences.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.680]   We've enjoyed all of it.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.520]   As children have come along, we committed that we were going to keep on going.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   And it's not easy.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.440]   I don't think any parent would say that it's easy to travel with children.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.200]   You go camping with your kids, and your kids get filthy, and they get the stuff filthy,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.440]   but you learn lessons.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.800]   Our lesson is we take a Rubbermaid tub and dunk the kids in the tub and use it as a bathtub.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   It's easier than going to the bathhouse.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.760]   And you figure things out as time goes on.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.480]   And then you just keep on going.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.000]   When we had two young children, we bought our first motor home, and we traveled in that,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   really enjoyed that.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.720]   Nothing crazy, just a week and a half.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.440]   I think our longest trip in that was two and a half weeks, maybe, something like that.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.360]   But in that two and a half weeks, we did all kinds of different things, and we learned
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.640]   that, yeah, you know what?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.540]   We could have a great time with a couple of children and a couple of dogs in this tiny
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.540]   little space.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.320]   And then we outgrew that, and we sold that thing, and we kept on going, and we've tried
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.680]   different things.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.840]   When we went off in our RV trip, we'd already downsized, right?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.000]   We'd already sold our house.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.400]   We'd already moved to a smaller apartment, and we enjoyed that.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.560]   But we were done with the apartment, ready to move anyway, and so we decided to go ahead
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.300]   and travel in the RV.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.760]   And traveling in the RV taught us a lot of things about what was easy and what was not
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.840]   easy, what we liked and what we didn't like.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.520]   There were some things that were wonderful about it, and there were some things that
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.560]   weren't.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.400]   And so as this information comes, you start to test your boundaries, and you start to
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.980]   see what you can do.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.960]   And you build your skills and your capabilities by trying things and by doing things.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.560]   Well, fast forward.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.680]   After you've lived in an RV for a time, it's a lot less scary to think of moving into suitcases
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.280]   and living in an Airbnb than it is if you have a big house and you're accustomed to
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   having the big house.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.000]   So we sold the RV, moved abroad.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.280]   When we moved abroad, we didn't really have a really great plan.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.240]   I had a credit card and a passport, and that was about it.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.600]   So we just flew outside of the United States.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.400]   I rented a house sight unseen on Airbnb.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.020]   I rented a car sight unseen on some random rental car website.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.200]   And we showed up, and guess what?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.600]   Everything was okay.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   It worked.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.440]   We went and bought some stuff for the kitchen and figured out how to do things in a new
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.280]   place, but it pretty much worked.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.800]   And then along the way, we changed a few different things and moved around a couple times and
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.360]   been here, been there, et cetera.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.080]   But along the way, we do more and more of it.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.920]   So today, it was funny that when I was talking to my wife about going traveling in the RV,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   it took quite a lot of convincing, a lot of time, because she thought it was kind of crazy.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   Only crazy people did that.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.800]   And so we made good progress there.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   But then remarkably, as we've started talking about this last time, it's been a fairly easy
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   thing.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.300]   And so having kind of picked up your roots and then having put down your roots in another
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.320]   place has showed us that it's not that difficult.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.760]   But what I would say is it's not that difficult for us at this point in time.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.560]   It's not to say there won't be hard times, right?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.800]   There's going to be some cranky kids and some fussy flights, I'm sure, and some tiredness
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.840]   and some wastes of money and some not fun days.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.720]   That's normal life.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.280]   What I mean is that psychologically, it doesn't feel hard or scary or difficult to me.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:28.480]   And so we're heading into an open-ended trip with one-way tickets and no specific return
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.800]   plan, and I'm going into it filled with confidence, knowing that I can do it.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.080]   But it's because I've done it.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.240]   You say, "Josh, but that's a cop-out.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   What if I haven't done it?"
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   Well, my answer is you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   And this is the same in anything, right?
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.120]   Your first time buying a house, when you're going into it, it feels so scary.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.720]   But then when you go into it, "Well, I could do that again."
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.240]   You sell your house and hopefully make a little bit of money and, "Okay, that was good.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   I could do that again.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.120]   I could do that again."
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.440]   It's funny.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.920]   Imagine just something as simple as proposing.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.680]   When I was a kid, I always imagined how proposing to a girlfriend and asking her to be your
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.400]   fiance would be the hardest thing in the world.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.640]   And then you kind of come to that phase of life, and it's not actually that hard.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.840]   But then once you've done it, once you've gotten married, I often think, "If my wife
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.920]   died, it wouldn't be that hard to do again.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   I'm sure I could do that again."
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.240]   You see people repeat this kind of thing all over the world.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   And so it's only hard and scary until you've done it.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.120]   But once you've done it, it opens up the thrill of the thing to you, and you can take advantage
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.600]   of those times in life.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.040]   I've got some specific plans for our traveling.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.920]   A lot of them involve you.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   Not necessarily meetups.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.760]   I don't know how many audience members I have in Serbia.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.400]   I'm sure a couple.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.240]   We'll do a meetup in Belgrade if I can get there.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.560]   But what I do think a lot about is your opportunities.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.680]   Where can I send you for opportunities?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.520]   And very much what I'm interested in is partly – I'm a big offshore and international
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.640]   diversification advocate these days because as a performer – I guess technically still
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.560]   a – I could still call myself a professional financial planner.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.480]   As a professional financial planner, it just solves so many problems for people.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.000]   It's simple things, whether it's offshore relocation, whether it's just simply banking
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.120]   offshore, if it's investing offshore.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.360]   It solves so many problems so elegantly.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:44.480]   I'm amazed how little most professional financial advisors and most professional counselors,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.080]   countenance and such, actually know about offshoring.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.520]   Last couple of months, I'm part of a Facebook group that has a bunch of financial planners.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.920]   There was a financial planner that came in and said, "I've got this client – forget
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.880]   – mid-20s, making a couple million dollars a year with an online business.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.560]   I think it was Amazon FBA.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   Here's his things.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.320]   Here's his setup, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.960]   Does anybody have any great ideas about how I can help him save money because his tax
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.320]   bills are too big?"
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.480]   I'm reading all these dozens of responses and it's just all the same old effective
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.400]   stuff for US residents and whatnot, but kind of same old, same old.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.960]   I kind of piped up and I said, "Well, you ought to at least – I think you owe him
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.680]   a professional obligation to let him know that he could run that business pretty much
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:38.920]   100% tax-free if he just left the United States and put into place some offshore stuff."
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.760]   Over the years, I've seen the magic of it and I've done the magic of it and I've
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.440]   looked for effective solutions and I found a lot of the international solutions effective.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.800]   There are so many more places in the world today where you can make money.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.200]   Right now, my biggest thrust personally and professionally is in the subject of investments.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:03.040]   I am deeply frustrated with the US investment conversation because where we basically devolved
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.280]   to as a society is the fact that you and I who have worked hard and who have saved our
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.760]   money are basically – if we're to believe popular financial advice, we're supposed
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.920]   to tuck it into a computer-run index fund and we're supposed to sit back and be happy
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.400]   with 6%.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.120]   Meanwhile, we get 0.3% on our savings accounts.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.360]   I find that utterly unacceptable and I've tried to handle it over the years by focusing
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.120]   on the value of investing in your own business where you can make thousands of percents of
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   rate of return if you have the right business opportunity.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.640]   But at the end of the day, even if you are in business, you still need a place to park
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.760]   your money and you still need some better asset management strategies than just sticking
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   your money in an index fund and getting 6%.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.800]   And of course, who knows about the 6%?
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   Maybe it'd be higher, right?
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.280]   Long-term history of the US stock market is of course higher than 6%.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:02.660]   But then of course, there are legions of sophisticated, responsible people telling us we should buckle
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.440]   in our pants and settle for low growth prospects in the future.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.800]   Well, I don't buy it.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.860]   I think that's a uniquely Western constraint and there's no reason not to go and search
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.400]   for higher return.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.600]   Now when I sit and look at my investing lifetime, I mean let's just do some math, right?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.160]   Let's just pretend you're 30 years old, right?
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.560]   You've got $200,000 of present value in your portfolio.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:35.680]   You're investing $20,000 per year in between 401ks, etc.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.040]   And you've got a 35-year investment time horizon and let's put it in 6%.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.760]   Well, at 6%, you can get rich, right?
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.840]   You can have $3.9 million in 35 years.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.400]   But at 12%, you can get really rich, right?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.120]   You can have $20 million, $20.2 million at 12%.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.280]   Well, I'm not interested in sitting around and taking 6% if I can have 12%.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.800]   I'm willing to get on a few airplanes.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.160]   I'm willing to go and look for some more interesting markets and I'm willing to learn a few languages
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.040]   and I'm willing to learn some new skills in order to get me to the $20 million instead
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.640]   of the – and you hopefully – to the $20 million instead of the 3.whatever million
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   dollars.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.960]   So those are some of my purposes professionally is that I'm going to be doing a lot of work
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   along the way.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.760]   I'll of course be podcasting, creating videos, creating content, creating courses, talking
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.360]   to you, teaching you, answering your questions, sharing what I'm learning along the way.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.880]   But I'm looking for opportunities because the world is full of opportunities for those
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.800]   who go looking for them.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.640]   You can sit back and just wait and be shocked when only a couple of opportunities come along
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.080]   or you can go look for them and be amazed at the sheer volume of opportunity that the
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.240]   world offers for you.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   Now there's no question though that part of what we're doing is just fun, right?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.520]   There's no question.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.280]   I'm looking forward to traveling the world with my children, showing them the world,
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   right?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.400]   I really appreciate the concept of world schooling.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.200]   For me, my experience traveling the world has opened my eyes to many things.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.600]   I really appreciate the concept of world schooling.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   My wife and I, we do home education with our children but we don't fit into any neat bucket.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.600]   I just draw inspiration from different philosophies.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.080]   We don't have one easily definable philosophy that controls our approach.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.760]   But I really believe that there is value in exposing your children to the way it's done
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.960]   in different places and to the opportunities that exist all around the globe.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.040]   And so that's important to me.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.560]   And what is also very important to me is take advantage of the freedom that you have in
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   life.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   This is a big deal for me.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:45.000]   From my story, I've wanted to be a guy who could make his living on a laptop since I
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.920]   was 15 years old.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   I'm not kidding.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.760]   I was a 15-year-old who was buying e-books about how to make money online.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   That was important to me.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.280]   Now it took me a lot longer than I ever thought it was going to be to figure it out.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.120]   Today I could figure it out a lot faster.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.920]   But that said, I figured it out.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.640]   But along the way, I've given up a lot of opportunities to keep certain kinds of freedom.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.000]   So there are different kinds of freedom.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.920]   There is financial freedom, how much money you have, and that is a very important freedom.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.280]   Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.520]   Making more money will gain you a higher level of personal freedom.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.320]   You'll have more choices.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:28.560]   However, I have sometimes made choices in life where I give up financial opportunity
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.080]   to keep time freedom and geographic freedom.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.760]   And so I would rather earn less money but have full control of my daily and weekly schedule
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   and of my physical location than earn more money and be locked into a specific location
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.880]   on a specific schedule.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.960]   That's the choice that I have made.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.320]   And yet when you do that, I think you really got to take advantage of it, right?
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.680]   And that's what's a little bit funny.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.440]   Over the last couple of years, I've been fairly stationary and I work on a fairly normal
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   schedule.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.720]   I go to my office 9 to 5, Monday to Friday.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.160]   And I've often wondered, "Well, Joshua, when are you going to take advantage of this freedom
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   that you have?"
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.840]   Well, it's time to take advantage of this freedom that you have.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.080]   And I would encourage you, when life gives you opportunities, take advantage of them
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.760]   because you can't always connect the time and the money.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.600]   But if you can connect the time and the money, just recognize there are some things you can
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.960]   do in life that you can't do at a different time in life.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.600]   There are certain times at which you can spend time with your children and times you can't.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.720]   There are certain times when you can take a break from your career and certain times
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   you can't.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.200]   And so you want to really focus in and do the things that are most appropriate at certain
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.760]   times in your life.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   How can you apply this?
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.320]   Well, if you have a job, I encourage you, be prepared for when that job ends.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.380]   Take a little mini retirement, a few months off, maybe a year off.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.120]   Take a little retreat, a little sabbatical.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   That means save money so that when you get laid off, you have money in the bank and you
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.200]   can take a little sabbatical and go and do whatever it is that you've been wanting to
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   do.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.480]   Pay attention to those inflection points in your children's ages.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.080]   Maybe they're finishing up at their elementary school and they're enrolled in elementary
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.680]   school but it only goes through sixth grade and they're going to have to change schools
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   anyway.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.120]   Well, why not pull them out for a year and go spend a year bouncing around Europe showing
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:22.840]   them the history of Western society instead of – and then go ahead and enroll them in
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.720]   the school next year.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Things like that.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.060]   Look for those opportunities in your life.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.400]   And so at the moment, we've got a good opportunity where it kind of fits in our life and timing
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.680]   where we're going to go and travel and I think it makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.960]   Then remember this, that if you're looking for a way to travel and if you're interested
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.840]   in long-term travel, remember that if the costs of travel are added to your current
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.640]   cost of life, then those costs can be pretty substantial.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.320]   But if you can just simply replace the current cost of life with the cost of travel, then
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.060]   they're often pretty moderate.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.760]   So if you look at your home and you probably won't want to do like us where you give up
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.880]   your home, but if you look at your home and you say, "We're going to keep this home,"
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.280]   look at renting it out.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.720]   Put it on a vacation swap, home exchange away kind of home away or home exchange kind of
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.000]   site.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Look for that.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.200]   Or go ahead and sell your home.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.280]   Maybe you have some profit in it.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.960]   Take some profit, go travel for a time and come back and buy another house.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.600]   Maybe you need to upgrade your house since that's a good time to sell a house and go
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   on.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.200]   Just look for these opportunities in life.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.840]   Don't be scared to do something just because you haven't done it yet.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.640]   Work your way towards it with little baby steps along the way.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640]   Now how does this involve you?
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.520]   So along the way I'm going to share with you a lot as much as I can.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.600]   I'll do my best to bring you really useful content.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   When I go to Mexico, I am going to Mexico and I'm going to interview a Mexican immigration
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600]   attorney for example.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.240]   I'll bring you an interview with a Mexican immigration attorney.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   I did this with a Canadian immigration consultant and many of you went back and downloaded Brandon's
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   book.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.120]   You signed up and started working with him and are in the process of building your offshore
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.160]   plan by immigrating to Canada.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.360]   I think Mexico is a really wonderful opportunity.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.200]   In fact, basically any North American who talks to me, I basically always say you should
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   go to Mexico first.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.640]   That should be one of your first internationalization options.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:25.600]   And so I'm going to go to San Miguel de Allende and interview a Mexican immigration attorney
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.520]   there and bring that interview to the show with you.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   So that will be coming to you in May.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.440]   Also I'm going to be going to Andrew Henderson's Nomad Capitalist Live in Cancun in May.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   I would imagine some of you will be there.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.040]   I really respect and admire what Andrew has built over the years.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.520]   He was on Radical Personal Finance years ago.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:53.200]   All the way back in episode 67 in September of 2014, Andrew Henderson was on the show.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.760]   He'll be back on the show very, very soon.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   I have recorded the interview, just editing it and will be releasing that interview for
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   you soon.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.760]   And then I'll be going to Cancun to Nomad Capitalist Live May 12 through May 15.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   And then again following that, we'll be heading to Costa Rica.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.320]   I am planning, stay tuned for the next couple of days for the information to be up, but
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.540]   I am going to be hosting an event.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:20.520]   One of the big goals that I had for 2020 was to start hosting more live events.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.400]   And I want to do these in the United States and elsewhere.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.280]   But of course, the pandemic made that difficult.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   So I shelved that.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   But I will be hosting a live event in Costa Rica in May.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.960]   So if you would like to brush off your passport, Costa Rica is totally open.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.640]   No COVID test needed.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.320]   Coming in, they just have a simple health form that you can complete.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.760]   You will need to have health insurance, but that shouldn't be a problem.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   It's not expensive if you need to buy it.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   So this should be an easy country for you to get to.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   And then of course, you'll need to think about getting back into your other countries.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.160]   If you're going to the United States, you'll need a COVID test to get back in the United
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.080]   States or elsewhere.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   Follow up with your own details there.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.800]   And then, like I said, in June in the United States and then July in Europe, TBD as far
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   as all of the destinations.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.680]   In closing, I would love to invite you to come with me on the journey.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.960]   I want to give you some ways to do that.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.360]   So a couple of new things.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.840]   Number one, I am launching a new text message opportunity to connect with me.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.880]   I want to encourage you to send a text message.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.680]   And perhaps you've been seeing this more and more people are doing texting, but I've set
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.200]   up a thing where you can text me directly and it comes right to my phone and I'll answer
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.280]   you and I'll respond.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.000]   But I'm going to use text messaging as a way of announcing where I'm going.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.640]   I'm going to be using it as a way of announcing where I am.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.280]   And it just gives you a chance to ask any questions you want to have, et cetera, to
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   reach me directly.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.240]   If you'd like to text me, I'll give you the number.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.960]   Grab your phone, I guess.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   Pull out your phone.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   Here's the number, 561-468-3158.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:02.160]   Again, 561-468-3158.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.040]   Send me a text message there and ask me any question you want.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.720]   Give me a hello and that will get you signed up for my text messages.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.000]   In addition, of course, you can sign up for the email list.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.520]   The best way to do that is go to RadicalBooklist.com, sign up for my Radical Booklist reading list
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.040]   and that'll get you signed up for my email list.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.320]   I'd love to have you there.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.560]   Go to RadicalBooklist.com.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.440]   In addition, please make sure to follow me on all of the social profiles.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.520]   One of the things I didn't do when we traveled around the United States is at the time I
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.760]   wasn't posting on social media.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.000]   Well, I've decided to change that.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.240]   I'm going to open up and I've walked away from a lot of privacy and I'm open up to a
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   lot more sharing.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.920]   So you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @JoshuaSheets on all of those
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   platforms.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   I'm easy to find.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.520]   J-O-S-H-U-A-S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   Find me on those platforms.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.320]   I'd love to follow up, be connected with you there.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.840]   Hoping to do some video and show you some interesting places, show you some interesting
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.120]   things along the way.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.600]   Stay tuned for details on that as well.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.280]   In closing, in addition to those things, I just did ask you, I'd love it if you would
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   leave a review for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.000]   So wherever you listen to the show, if you listen on Spotify, if you listen on iTunes,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.680]   just take a moment and just drop a rating and a review, a couple of words, a few sentences
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.520]   is great but that would be really, really helpful to the show.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.680]   I'm committed to continuing to serve you and helping the show grow.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.520]   I hope to see you this year on the road but in closing I would just encourage you and
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.400]   say it's only hard, it's only scary until you do it.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.320]   And so if there's something that you want to do, start figuring out what are some micro
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.560]   things that I can do to do certain aspects of this.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.960]   You may not be ready to get rid of all your stuff and say, "Oh, this is going to be easy."
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.540]   It's not, it's not.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.440]   But maybe you can take a trip.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.680]   That's a good start.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.600]   Get your passports.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.720]   Just start.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.800]   But start taking micro actions in the direction of your dreams and I promise it's only hard
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   and scary until you do it.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.200]   Text me, 561-468-3158.
