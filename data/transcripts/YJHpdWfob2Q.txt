[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   What are some of the other big kind of 80/20 principle things to do to affect your home energy?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.800]   The biggest use of energy comes from heating and cooling, for sure. If it's the middle summer and
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.920]   you're trying to stay cool and you like it 70 degrees, maybe try 72, maybe try 74. Even just
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.040]   one degree of difference can actually knock your bill down 5%, 10%. The other thing you can do,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.960]   if you live in an area, like I know in California you have time abuse rates, that's not everywhere,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.680]   but if you really want to save a lot of money, shift how and when you're spending that money.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.240]   That energy. So for instance, in California, time use rates are super cheap overnight.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.120]   What you can do is you could over air condition your house overnight and then basically turn the
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.760]   system off during the day and let your house gradually come back up to temperature. So you're
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.280]   not using any energy during the day when you're trying to stay cool because you pre-cooled your
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.600]   house overnight. You're basically using your entire house as basically just a giant thermal battery.
