[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   It is almost certain that right now we are missing some of the greatest human talent
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.640]   that is just trapped in some poor village in India or China, and we'll never find out
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.800]   where their accomplishment is.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.720]   If you think that we are one day going to beat death, right now it is quite likely that
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.120]   the guy that could have beaten death five or ten years earlier is in some poor village
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.400]   in India or China, and by not allowing immigration, that person is not going to get to beat death.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.960]   If we're going to beat death, we'll beat it eventually, but just to shave five or ten
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.240]   years off of that, this matters a lot for me.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.880]   Those five or ten years really make a difference if the technology just frees people at the
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   age they're at.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.840]   I want to get frozen really quick because I'm going downhill.
