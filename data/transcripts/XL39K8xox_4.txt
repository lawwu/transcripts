[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.140]   - Well, today is Christmas day,
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.560]   the day we celebrate the birth of Christ.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.200]   Every year we get a whole batch of Christmas questions.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960]   The most asked for question about Christmas
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.640]   is by far about Santa.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640]   And we addressed him on the podcast twice already,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   back in 2016 and 2018, in episodes 978 and 1288.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.320]   You can check those out, especially episode 978,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200]   which ends with one of the great paragraphs,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.440]   I think, in the APJ archive.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.880]   But here is the second most asked about Christmas question,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.840]   represented by at least 35 emails
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.560]   in the inbox that I can see.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.280]   Why did the church begin celebrating
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.640]   the birth of Christ on December 25th?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.200]   This date appears connected to a holiday
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.760]   with Germanic roots in the pagan celebration
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   of Yule or Yule tide.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.480]   In those emails, commonly mentioned texts
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.440]   include those that forbid God's people
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.200]   from accommodating or adopting the traditions
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.960]   and holidays and feasts of the nations.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.560]   Especially mentioned are texts like 1 Kings 12.33,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.800]   Deuteronomy 12.29-32, and Jesus' own words
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   in Mark 7.9.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.160]   The same is true of Jeremiah 10.1-4,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.980]   a text used to warn against Christmas trees, even.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.360]   So maybe this is a horrible question
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.120]   to address on Christmas day, I don't know.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.920]   But from the emails, here is a representative email
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.400]   from a listener named Michelle.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.360]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.320]   Why do Christians celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25th?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.200]   Before I was born again, I was a pagan and celebrated Yule.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.240]   As I understand it, Constantine placed Jesus' birth date
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.040]   on December 25th to sort of cover up a pagan holiday
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.720]   to get them to switch to Christianity more easily.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.840]   But after being born again,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.000]   the thought of celebrating Christmas
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120]   now makes me uneasy.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.240]   Should it?
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420]   - So let me say a word about each of those passages,
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.280]   just a brief word to point people
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.560]   in a possible consideration direction,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.440]   and then say a word about December 25 and why that date,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.240]   and then maybe give a principle to guide us.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.640]   1 Kings 12.28, the idolatrous King Jeroboam
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.600]   made two golden calves, called the people to worship them,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   and then in verse 33 says that he devised a time
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.280]   for that celebration out of his own heart.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.900]   I think that's what people are probably fingering there.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.700]   So the essential problem was blatant idolatry,
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.220]   two golden calves.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.580]   And the counterpart today would be,
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.060]   let's just pick a random day.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.500]   Let's say December 25 to celebrate justification
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.220]   on the basis of works,
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.620]   apart from the blood righteousness of Christ.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.100]   That would be the counterpart.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.940]   Doesn't matter what day.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.900]   The essence of the issue was idolatry.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.960]   Deuteronomy 12.30 warns the people
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.880]   as they enter into the promised land,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.940]   you shall not worship the Lord your God the way they do.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360]   They even burned their sons and daughters
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.660]   in the fire to their gods.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.680]   And then God adds, do what I have commanded you
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.080]   and do not add or take from it.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.380]   Now, there are dozens and dozens of meticulous stipulations
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.480]   in the Old Testament about how to approach God,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.760]   how the priesthood of function,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.000]   the sacrifices to be done,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.120]   the sacred space is to be used.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.640]   Now, whether we today are governed
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   with such meticulous specifics
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.900]   that we shouldn't take from or add to in the New Testament,
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.240]   I'll address that in just a minute.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.000]   I think the answer is no.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.120]   Mark 7.9, they were rejecting the commandment
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.960]   to honor your father and mother
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.180]   by diverting financial care from their parents
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.080]   to an ostensibly worshipful dedication
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.420]   of their money to the synagogue
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.620]   instead of their parents' needs.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.460]   And the issue there was not that traditions exist,
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.900]   that's not the problem,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.540]   but that they contradict the commandment of God,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.980]   honor your father and mother.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.420]   Jeremiah 10.2, learn not the ways of the nations.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.500]   A tree from the forest is cut down
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   and worked with an ax by the hands of the craftsmen.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.860]   They decorate it with silver and gold.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.580]   They fasten it with a hammer and nails
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.340]   so that it cannot move.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.300]   Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.460]   and they cannot speak, they have to be carried.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   So the point is it's absolute nonsense
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.300]   to make an idol out of a created thing like a tree,
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.380]   which you shape with your own ax,
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.140]   you decorate with your own hands,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.340]   you carry it on your own cart,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.220]   and then you fall down and worship it.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.980]   I mean, the prophets thought this was absurd.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.160]   This is indeed an implicit warning
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.600]   to believers of all ages,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.040]   never to turn away from the living God
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.240]   to a created thing on Christmas day or any day,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   and treat it as an object of greater affection to you
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.660]   than you have in the living God.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.300]   So I don't think any of those texts
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.340]   is an indictment of Christians
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.340]   choosing a day on which we make much
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.580]   of the incarnation of Christ.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.740]   But the question then becomes,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.220]   well, why December 25?
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.620]   And there's some mixed up stuff going on there.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.420]   Now, as I survey and resurvey
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.460]   the historical opinions of scholars
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.140]   about why we celebrate Christmas on December 25,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.140]   it seems to me that there is no consensus.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.700]   So the suggestions that were made into question,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.640]   maybe, maybe not.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.620]   There are competing explanations.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.140]   Let me mention two.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.340]   One is that December 25 was a pagan holiday
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.380]   for celebrating the birth of the sun, S-U-N,
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.660]   and that Christians adapted and countered
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.660]   that pagan idea with the celebration
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.420]   of the true light of the world.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.100]   That's one explanation.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.700]   And that would be back in the Roman days,
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.340]   not just later in the Germanic time.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.340]   Another explanation is that for various reasons,
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.900]   the church fathers believed that Jesus was conceived
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   on March 25, around the date of his death.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.540]   And that Christmas, therefore, as it so happens,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.260]   when God does, makes babies,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.860]   nine months later is December 25.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.500]   So which of those explanations came first?
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.140]   Here's what the Oxford Companion to Christian Thought says.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.660]   The hypothesis that December 25 was chosen
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.900]   for celebrating the birth of Jesus
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.020]   on the basis of the belief that his conception
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.300]   occurred on March 25, quote,
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.740]   "potentially establishes December 25
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   as a Christian festival before the Aurelian decree,
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.580]   which when promulgated might have provided
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.020]   for the Christian feast,
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.460]   both an opportunity and a challenge."
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.080]   In other words, they're not sure which came first,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.220]   the pagan or the Christian identification
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.260]   of this particular date
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.220]   as the celebration of the incarnation.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.680]   So I don't feel, frankly, any freedom to be dogmatic
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   about why Christians use December 25 as the day
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.780]   for a special focus on the incarnation.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.300]   So that leaves me and us, perhaps,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.660]   what principle should guide us?
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.940]   There is a massive difference
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.020]   between the way the Old Testament regulates formal worship
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.620]   with dozens and dozens of stipulations
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.260]   and the way the New Testament treats worship.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.020]   You find almost no stipulations in the New Testament
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   for what is mandated and what is forbidden
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.180]   in formal worship.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.100]   There are some, but not many.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.240]   And I've argued, I think probably on this podcast before,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.900]   that the reason for this is that the New Testament,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.780]   unlike the Old Testament,
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.920]   is a handbook for all the nations of the world,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   not a liturgical book for Israel or any one culture.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.120]   Thousands of cultures all over the world
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.780]   are going to worship with their roots in the New Testament
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.780]   and details of the forms are going to be different everywhere
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.300]   because the New Testament doesn't specify
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.620]   the way the Old Testament did
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.460]   for how to go about our worship services
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.780]   or times or seasons.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.980]   The principle that I would draw attention to is this,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.900]   1 Corinthians 10:25,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.060]   "Eat whatever is sold in the meat market
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.940]   without raising any question on the ground of conscience,
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.840]   for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.500]   and you are disposed to go,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.340]   eat whatever is set before you
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.020]   without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.380]   But if someone says to you,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.460]   this has been offered in sacrifice, like to an idol,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.160]   then do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.140]   and for the sake of conscience."
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.820]   Now, the principle is this,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.800]   in Christ, Christians are free to eat meat
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.040]   that has been offered to idols,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.100]   provided there's no idolatry involved
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   and provided we are not sending any clear messages
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.640]   to the pagan, to the world,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   that we worship what they worship.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.360]   Now, that's a serious principle.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.440]   So I think with regard to all the ways
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.160]   in which our life overlaps with culture,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.920]   not just Christmas days, but all the time,
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   there's just hundreds of ways that our lives,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.840]   our lifestyles overlap with our culture.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   We should make every effort to live and to celebrate
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.040]   in such a way that we show
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.720]   that Christ is supremely valuable in our lives,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.620]   not the world or the things of the world.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.880]   Now, that's quite a challenge at Christmas time.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.040]   Let me close with a reference
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   to the way Noelle and I began our marriage
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.280]   and tried to think this through,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.800]   not at all saying we got it perfect
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.960]   or that anybody should do it the way we do it,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.120]   just the principle of thinking in a certain way.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.200]   So we came to celebrate our first Christmas,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   and as a married couple,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.960]   wanting to honor traditions that we'd got from our parents
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.240]   and wanting to do it the way our family would do it,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.760]   we wanted it to be distinctly Christian as much as possible.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.280]   Now, how would we bear witness to our children
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.680]   and to our community about Christ at Christmas?
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.000]   And I'll just mention three things.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.840]   There were more than three things, but here's three.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.880]   We never had a traditional Christmas tree.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.620]   That was kind of weird for us.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.880]   We both grew up with Christmas trees.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.540]   I think all of our kids have Christmas trees.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.520]   We visit people with Christmas trees.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   We've never had a Christmas tree of a traditional kind
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.720]   in our home at Christmas time.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   We instead said, let's make a big manger scene,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   the center on a table with a tablecloth,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.800]   and under the table, we'll put the gifts,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.100]   just to recenter everything toward Christ symbolically
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.440]   in the manger scene.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.240]   So the second thing we did
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.080]   is we didn't have Christmas stockings.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.960]   In fact, we never even mentioned Santa Claus.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.520]   If the kids asked about Santa Claus,
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.360]   we said, that's not a real story.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.000]   That's just a interesting story that people tell.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.200]   There's nothing real about it.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   It has nothing to do with Christmas in its reality.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.520]   Instead, we created this thing called shepherd's pouches,
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.160]   and the kids would, over the December month,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.760]   do little jobs for no else.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.000]   You'd pay them extra that they wouldn't ordinarily
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.660]   get paid for doing the dishes, helping with the laundry,
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.560]   and they were to put that money, little by little,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   in the pouches, knowing that the pouches
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.120]   would be laid before the manger,
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.280]   like gifts were brought to Jesus,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.200]   and in the morning, those pouches would have
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.920]   little favors in them for the kids,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.140]   and the money would be given to some cause
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.920]   that we agreed on together as a family
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.460]   for the good of the needy and in the name of Jesus.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.680]   And the third thing we did was that I tried
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.160]   to make the house beautiful in the neighborhood.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   We live in a pretty,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.260]   (laughs)
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.280]   it's not the most attractive neighborhood,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.240]   and we're one of the front-end houses.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.040]   The first house you see is you come across the bridge,
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.560]   across 9435 W, Ventura neighborhood,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.600]   now used to be called Phillips neighborhood.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   What's the first thing you see?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   I didn't want it to be garish,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   and yet I did want it to say Christmas is here,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   so I used stars, I stars everywhere.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.000]   This is the star house,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.820]   with a Christian banner on the front.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.760]   Anyone who wants to get close and see
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.880]   what all the stars mean,
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.680]   Jesus is the reason for the season,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.480]   hanging on the front door.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.600]   So those are three ways that we tried
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.160]   to just make our kids as happy as they could be
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.680]   in the celebration of one of the greatest events
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.920]   in the history of the universe,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.400]   the incarnation of the Son of God,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   and yet do it with as much distinctly Christian effort
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.800]   as we could.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.680]   - Amen, thank you for that word, Pastor John,
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.600]   I appreciate it.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.920]   Well, speaking of Christmas Day,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.160]   this is one of those moments to reflect on the mercy
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.840]   and the grace of God that has been shown to us,
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.040]   and we are tremendously blessed in Christ.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.240]   That's an understatement.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.120]   Incredible wealth and riches of spiritual resources in Him,
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.560]   and we are so richly blessed to have you
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.700]   along for the ride of this podcast as well,
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.680]   so thank you for another year.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.200]   We are about to close out year number eight
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.680]   on the podcast, which is really incredible,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.760]   and it's only possible because you are partnering
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.240]   with us financially, along with listening every week,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.000]   carrying us along in your prayers,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   and sending us so many really great questions,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   like this one.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.020]   This podcast really is possible
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.360]   because of the grace of God we get through your life,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.800]   so thank you to each of you.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.480]   Pastor John and I want to wish you and your family
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   a wonderful, joy-filled, Christ-filled, Merry Christmas Day.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.120]   I'm Tony Reinke, we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
