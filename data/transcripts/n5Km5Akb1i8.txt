[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   All right, one last question, family and friend related, comes from Evend, who says, "How
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.640]   do you explain a shift to the deep life to friends and family?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.720]   I am a law student from Norway, and your books and ideas have really helped me in answering
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.340]   some big questions regarding my life and career.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.000]   My friends and family don't really seem to understand my shift in focus.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.360]   I live with my three best friends, and they still enjoy the reckless responsibility-free
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.160]   lifestyle the early 20s are renowned for.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240]   I did too, but now me and my friends' ambitions don't align anymore.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   They plan a lot of activities during the day, which is when I want to work.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.160]   I still hang out with them almost every evening, but when I now say no to their daytime activities
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.240]   or want to go read a book in the evening, they bug me about working too much, and I
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240]   feel bad.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.760]   Also my father expects me to just kind of hang out in the living room when I am home
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420]   for Christmas and gets annoyed when I want to go for a walk on my own, reflect, or go
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.800]   to my room and create a small video for a couple of hours.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.640]   As you've explained, the deep life is radical and demands that you are comfortable with
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.640]   missing out on other things.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.000]   However, I'm finding it hard to steer my life in a different direction than my friends and
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.800]   family and to miss out on some of their experiences.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   Well I think you're going through a well-known developmental phrase right now, and I believe
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.620]   the Latin description of this developmental phrase is "you're growing the hell up."
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.840]   That's all that's happening here with your friends.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.640]   You're growing up.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.260]   They're still in that student mode.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.060]   You are transitioning to more of an adult mode, where your identity is now largely separated
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.580]   from a group dynamic and is much more individuated.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.820]   You have autonomy over your time as well as responsibility.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.180]   Now it's kind of up to me to take care of myself and make money and pay the bills with
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.660]   responsibility, but you also have autonomy.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.460]   Socializing becomes more something that is compartmentalized.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.540]   I want to spend time with you.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.620]   Let's make a time to do this.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.100]   We're going to work out together.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.700]   We're going to go to a movie together, but it becomes a much more scheduled, less of
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.580]   this sort of background ongoing hum that you would see in a group dynamic.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.740]   You're becoming an adult.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.660]   This happens at different times for different people.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.940]   Just watch any Judd Apatow movie from 15 years ago and you will see for some people it comes
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.940]   kind of late.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.820]   Other people, they get there earlier.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.840]   You basically are the knocked up character after Katherine Heigl has the baby, not before.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   That's sort of what's happening here.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   And I think it's good.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   Everyone goes through this.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   You're just starting to go through it now.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.980]   You got to focus on work, get a job with opportunities, be so good they can't ignore you, build rare
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.620]   and valuable skills, build up a little bit more income, have your own place, some more
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.140]   responsibility, gain some more sense of efficacy.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.660]   This is the standard stuff of growing up in your twenties.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.100]   Your relationship with your friends are going to change.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.740]   Some of those friends are going to go away as you find more adult friends.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.540]   Some of those friends will grow up and will remain your friends.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.580]   That's just all natural.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.820]   Your relationship with your family is going to change as you become more of an adult.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.900]   It's not a father son relationship.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.260]   It becomes more of a peer relationship.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.140]   And then you realize, you know, if I'm home for a few days for Christmas, you know, I'm
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.020]   here to be around him and socialize with my family.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.260]   I can do my deep work structured reflection on my own time.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   And maybe I cut my trip a little bit shorter, but what if I'm there, maybe I want to be
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.540]   there for, what does this guy need?
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.180]   Right now, suddenly it's a different relationship.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.180]   You're interacting with peers.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.580]   You're actually thinking, what does this person need from me?
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.580]   It's more maturity.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.140]   Anyways, it's all great.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.980]   I love being an adult.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.540]   I was an adult early.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.540]   I was impatient.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.780]   I was about halfway through college where I was ready to be on my own and doing this
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.780]   type of thing.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.140]   So it's good what you're going through.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.260]   Live on your own, start building your own way in the world.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.780]   Let the ideas of the deep life structure this pursuit from day one.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.140]   That will keep you on the right track.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.420]   But as you move farther down this track with structure to your forward momentum, life is
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.820]   going to get deeper and more interesting.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.700]   So you're just starting event and it's going to get deeper and deeper.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.060]   And yeah, it's painful at first.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.060]   Your friends aren't there.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.060]   They'll get there, but you're going to hell up.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.060]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.180]   going to hell up.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.180]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   going to hell up.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.760]   (upbeat music)
