[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.100]   This episode was hosted by the Bogleheads Starting Out and Mid-Career Life Stages and
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.280]   recorded June 15, 2022.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.260]   It features a conversation with Q&A on personal investing with J.L. Collins, author of The
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.880]   Simple Path to Wealth.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.840]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.

[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.400]   investment advice.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.120]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Bogleheads Chapter Series event.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.840]   Today's session is jointly hosted by the Starting Out and Mid-Career Accumulators Life Stages
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.240]   Chapters and today's session is being recorded as already discussed.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.080]   As most of you know, the Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for obtaining
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.840]   financial independence and a quick shout out, as Miriam mentioned, to Mel Lindauer, who's
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   in the audience.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.660]   Mel is a founder of the Bogleheads and also a co-author of the Bogleheads Guide to Investing,
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.020]   so it's great to have you here, Mel.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.160]   Our special guest tonight is J.L. Collins, author of The Simple Path to Wealth.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.200]   J.L. is well known to many Bogleheads and has often praised the work of Jack Bogle.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.240]   J.L.'s career is long and varied, and his wisdom is timeless.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.040]   His gifts include distilling sometimes complex topics into very digestible, user-friendly
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.440]   guidance.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.200]   His books and blog, including the stock series on his blog, are known for doing exactly that.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.480]   And more recently, apart from authoring A Simple Path to Wealth, J.L. published another
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.960]   book called How I Lost Money in Real Estate Before It Was Fashionable.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.640]   We'll touch on lessons learned there later.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   You can learn more about J.L. on his blog by googling J.L. Collins.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.040]   And a friendly disclaimer before we start, today's session is for informational purposes
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.120]   only and should not be construed as personal investment advice.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   So now back to our program.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.840]   J.L., you should know we have a global audience, so if you ever want to highlight a similarity
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.240]   or difference of living or investing abroad, feel free.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.080]   And on that note, we'd specifically like to wish a warm welcome to our Japan Bogleheads
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   chapter.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.520]   And I'll share a quote from a Japan chapter member about you, J.L.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   So the quote is, "His book is very popular in Japan.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.600]   The number of reviews at Amazon are over 1,000."
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.800]   We covered Zoom tips, so hopefully folks are good there.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   We'll now cover the format of what to expect tonight.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.320]   J.L. and I will have a conversation covering a range of topics, including questions submitted
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.680]   by the Boglehead community via the RSVP survey questionnaire.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.280]   Feel free to submit questions via the chat during the meeting.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.400]   And later in the evening, probably around a quarter to nine Eastern, we'll pause the
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.920]   primary conversation and we'll turn it over to Miriam and Lucas to take questions from
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.080]   the chat.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.800]   So one more thing I'll mention about J.L., folks who are familiar with him and folks
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   who aren't will learn tonight, his voice is incredible, it's mesmerizing.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.720]   So this next specific suggestion, it's timeless, but it's specifically relevant these days.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.120]   And that is J.L. has a recording on YouTube called "A Guided Meditation for When the Stock
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.960]   Market is Dropping."
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.520]   It's just under 11 minutes, it's got over 70,000 views, and I, along with many others,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.880]   highly recommend it.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.160]   Another note, J.L. has many interviews on YouTube, he's done many podcasts, they're
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.040]   easily available online, in addition to the content on his blog.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.480]   So while we want to make sure tonight's session covers intro material for everyone, we also
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.640]   want to make sure we cover info that J.L. might want to speak about that he's spoken
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.680]   about less often, so that we cover a wider range of topics.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.040]   In doing so, we'll probably alternate between typical personal finance, and we may go from
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.920]   practical to philosophical at times.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.360]   So with that, let's begin.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   Welcome, J.L.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   Thank you.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   What an introduction.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   I hope I live up to your very kind words.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360]   An honor to be here, I appreciate the invitation.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   Yes, it's so great to have you.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   So J.L., you and I met in Ecuador in 2014 at a Chautauqua, which was a gathering about
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   financial independence that you helped conceive and host and continue to bring to life.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.600]   Interestingly, we had a question from the community about how you got involved with
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.740]   the financial independence movement.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.960]   So it would be great if you could elaborate on what Chautauqua means to you, and how it
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.320]   helps folks.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.160]   And similarly, can you tell us a bit about your own FI journey, financial independence,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.920]   and how you connected to the broader FI movement?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.000]   Well, you covered a lot of ground there.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.200]   So let me start with how I connected, I guess, with the FI movement.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.040]   In 2011, I had started writing a series of letters to my daughter, who was then in college,
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.320]   about financial things, about investing specifically.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   Because in my view, if you get that right, your life is infinitely better, and you have
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.160]   far more options.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   If you get it wrong, it's a much more difficult path.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.160]   So like all parents, I wanted the best for my daughter, and I wanted to impart this information
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   to her.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.520]   But I started way too early, and I pushed it way too hard, and I managed to turn her
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.840]   off to all things financial.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.800]   So I thought I'd better start getting this stuff down on paper, against the day where
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.360]   she might be ready and willing to hear it.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.120]   So I started writing a series of letters to her, and I shared some of these with a business
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.120]   friend of mine.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.640]   And he said, "You know, this is pretty interesting stuff.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.440]   You ought to put it on a blog."
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.200]   Now, at the time, I'd heard of blogs, but I'd never actually seen one.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.080]   And I had no interest in starting a blog, but it struck me as a great way to archive
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.680]   the information.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.360]   So I figured out how to build a blog, and I started putting this stuff up, and as my
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.200]   friends suggested, I sent it around to my family and friends, and as I figured, none
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   of them really cared.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.640]   But then amazingly, and slowly over time, I started to build this audience that's now
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.960]   international in nature.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.280]   And then around 2012, I started looking around, saying, "You know, I like this stuff, it'd
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.800]   be kind of fun to speak about it."
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.160]   And there were no venues in those days, at least none that I could find.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.480]   And so I decided to create one.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.600]   And what I created was the Chautauqua.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.520]   You attended the second year.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.380]   The very first year was 2013, it took about a year to pull it together.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:24.560]   And Chautauqua is our retreats where we, I like to say, we pick a really cool place.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.120]   We gather a small group of cool people, and we talk about cool stuff.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.760]   And when I put the first one together in 2013, I had no idea if anybody would show up.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   But they did, and they all had an incredible time, and so we did again in 2014, and with
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.120]   a little hiatus because of COVID in the last couple of years.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:54.320]   We are now back this year, and we'll be in Columbia for two weeks, back to back.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.480]   Each Chautauqua is a week long.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.780]   So I think I covered your questions there.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.680]   You did, and that's phenomenal.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:10.480]   So since then, as your own experience in early, in retirement, you mentioned you're nomadic
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   and you'll be in Florida for a period.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.760]   Can you tell us about your nomadic lifestyle, how it's been, what are some examples of how
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.240]   you spend your time, and maybe some great and not so great surprises from being nomadic?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:35.040]   Well, so we've been nomadic for, I don't know, since about 2016, 2017.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.420]   We have a little cottage on Lake Michigan in Wisconsin where we spend summers.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.840]   That's where I am at the moment.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.160]   This past winter, before we came back to Cabonda, which is what we call our cottage before we
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.700]   came back to Cabonda, we were mostly wandering around out in the Western United States.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:00.020]   And so we'll be back here for June, July, and August, and then September, we go down
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.320]   to Columbia for the month, and of course, in the middle of that month are the two Chautauquas.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.960]   And then we'll be back here for a month in October, and then we'll go south towards Florida,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   the Southeast for next winter.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   But at various times, in 2019, I think it was, we were in Europe for the better part
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.440]   of the year, and we had Chautauquas in the spring and in the fall, one in the UK and
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.200]   a couple in Portugal.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.320]   So that's what drew us there.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.000]   And then of course, when COVID hit, that grounded us, as it did a lot of people.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.960]   So we spent 18 consecutive months here at Cabonda, but that's kind of what that looks
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   like.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.680]   - Okay, and on the surprise side of things, any highlights, great things that happened
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.680]   that you didn't expect?
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.240]   And maybe for folks who are looking forward to retirement or being nomadic, any lessons
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.320]   learned that you'd wanna share?
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:08.200]   - Yeah, well, a couple of things, I think on the plus side, we live in a, just traveling
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.520]   around in the U.S., which is what we've done the last couple of years, we live in an amazingly
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.200]   beautiful country, and with incredible people, you turn on the news, and I tend to see more
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.760]   news when we're at Cabonda than when we're on the road, and it's pretty horrific.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.840]   And if you just watched that, you would think that these were not the kind of people you'd
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.640]   wanna go out and meet, but the truth is, at least our experience, the people you meet
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:46.360]   traveling on the road are incredible, and wonderfully warm people, and it's a drop-dead
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   gorgeous country.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.380]   The difficult part of it is, at least as I'm getting older, I don't think I had so much
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:58.520]   trouble with this when I was younger, but because we move a lot, every time you're in
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:05.840]   a new hotel room or a new Airbnb, you have to learn a whole new series of things, from
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.000]   anything from how to turn on the television, and how to work the stove, and the heating
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.920]   and air conditioning, to where the local grocery store is.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.080]   So that's kind of a pain over time, so it's nice to settle down for an extended amount
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.200]   of time, and I think when we go to Florida, as we were talking a little bit before the
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.720]   show started, we're gonna try to pick one or two places where we settle in and use that
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.080]   as a home base.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.360]   Okay.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   Sounds great.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.880]   So you mentioned the news and how it can really drive you bananas.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.160]   We had two related questions from the community, I'll read them both.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.780]   How do I stop my addiction to financial news, and what do you think is a key for tuning
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.880]   out the noise of the market/news cycle, and what information sources are worth the time?
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.320]   Well, so I think that breaking your addiction to the news cycle, I guess I haven't broken
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.920]   mine, because I do still tune it in, I think what I've chosen to do is just create a certain
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:22.520]   psychological distance from it, and to recognize how much of it is nonsense, particularly around
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.800]   financial predictions.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.760]   So there's no end of people predicting what the stock market's gonna do, and of course
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.580]   that's presented as if these people really are clairvoyant, or they really have some
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.120]   special knowledge base or insights that the rest of us don't have, and of course that's
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   nonsense.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.800]   Now, because there are so many people making so many predictions, almost anything that
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   the market can possibly do is being predicted by somebody.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.480]   So somebody is correct.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.040]   Not because they're clairvoyant, but just because somebody has to be correct.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.680]   It's kind of like lottery winners, you know, when somebody wins the lottery, we don't all
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.120]   sit back and think, "Oh, Gorey won the lottery, he's figured out how to pick winning lottery
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   numbers."
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.920]   No, we're smart enough to sit back and say, "Gorey won the lottery, he got exceptionally
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.880]   lucky, he beat enormous odds and happened to pick the right numbers."
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.040]   When you see somebody predicting what the market's gonna do and they turn out to be
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.720]   right, that's the frame of reference I think you ought to have.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Okay.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   Sounds good.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   Any particular trusted sources that you'd like to mention that might resonate with the
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.880]   Bogleheads community?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.680]   You know, for news programs?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.120]   Yeah, not so much.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   I don't think, you know, I'm always a little struck by the fact that when I watch the news,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.880]   and we like Shepard Smith, for instance, on CNBC because we like his style, we like his
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   presentation.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.580]   But when I watch the news, most of it is about stuff that I don't know about.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.800]   But I can't help but notice, and I'm not just picking on his show, but in general, that
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:18.240]   when they start reporting about things I do know about, how inaccurate they are.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.320]   And it's striking to me, as I've mentioned this to friends, that they all say, "You know,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.920]   I noticed the same thing when they start reporting on my area of expertise," you know, if they're
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:37.440]   a doctor or a lawyer or whatever they know about, how inaccurate the reporting tends
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   to be.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.080]   And I think once you recognize that, then you, I think you learn to take everything
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.440]   with a grain of salt.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   Makes perfect sense.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   Thank you.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.480]   So, as you know, we have a lot of retirees in the audience in the Boglehead community.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.640]   Switching to specific practical insights, and you can approach this in both hypothetical
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.720]   and actual, so your own practices as well as a broader general application.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.960]   Can you share thoughts about rebalancing portfolios in retirement?
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.360]   Thoughts on withdrawal rates, and also thoughts on keeping an emergency fund?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.720]   So again, that's kind of three things you might, I may need you to help me remember
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.400]   them as we go along.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.240]   So I think the first was allocations, right?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   Rebalancing.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   Right.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   Rebalancing your allocations.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.960]   So in my world, when you're working and you have earned income, you should be living below
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   your means, and that frees up a cash flow that you can channel towards your investments.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   And my fund of choice is VTSAX, which I'm, not every group I talk to is familiar with
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.200]   it, but I'm sure this group's very familiar with it.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:07.080]   And as I tell my daughter, just put in the, your set amount of money every month, don't
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.920]   pay any attention to what the market's doing.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.720]   When you do that, when the market plunges like it has been of late, you're taking advantage
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   of that drop.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.080]   You're buying more shares for that given amount of money, and that of course is helping smooth
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   the ride.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.840]   And I also tell her and people, young people or people accumulating wealth, that a market
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.120]   drop is a blessing.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   It's a gift, as long as you don't panic and sell and continue to invest.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.180]   Now at some point when you want to live on the portfolio, it seems to me that you want
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.320]   something else to smooth the volatility of stocks in the way that earned income cash
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.080]   flow did.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   And that's bonds.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:56.760]   And of course, whatever allocation you choose is up to your tolerance for volatility, with
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.600]   the understanding that the more bonds you add, the less volatile your portfolio is likely
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.140]   to be, but also the lowest, lower performance you'll have on time.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:13.320]   So that's the trade off that only you as an individual can decide what the right balance
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.300]   is, is for your own tolerance for volatility.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:25.440]   With the important caveat that if you let your stock portion drop below 50%, you are
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:34.720]   endangering the long-term survivability of your portfolio as you begin to draw from it.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:44.520]   And so rebalancing is just a function of keeping whatever percentage you have decided in sync.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:52.540]   So if you're 75% stocks and 25% bonds, as I happen to be, when stocks drop, as they
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.040]   have recently, you might shift some of those bonds over into stocks to bring that balance
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   back into place.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.440]   In fact, I just did that myself two days ago.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:11.960]   In terms of withdrawal, there's a lot of discussion, unnecessary for the most part in my view,
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   around what's come to be known as the 4% rule, and I think it's that word rule that gets
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.480]   people all concerned.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.000]   If you change it from rule to guideline, I think you have a brilliant guideline to inform
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.360]   your thinking about how much money you need in retirement, or conversely, how much you
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.480]   can withdraw from your given portfolio and expect it to last.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.560]   But this idea that 4%, or any other percent, is something you want to choose and lock in
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:54.200]   and have it adjusted every year for inflation and never pay any attention to it is a little
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.400]   bit insane, in my view.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.600]   You're obviously going to want to pay attention to what the markets are doing while you're
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.480]   withdrawing this money, for two reasons.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   One is that, according to the Trinity study, in the 30 years they looked at, while 4% is
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:19.880]   an extraordinarily conservative and successful number, in 4% of the time, it fails, it doesn't
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.040]   last for the 30-year period that they measured.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.280]   So you certainly want to pay attention so you don't run out of money, which is everybody's
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.840]   fear.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.640]   But that's actually the smaller of the two reasons, it seems to me, to pay attention,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.120]   because it's the one that is least likely.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:42.140]   The one that is most likely, and happens most times when you look at the Trinity study,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:49.320]   is that if you withdraw 4% from a given portfolio over the course of 30 years, at the end of
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.600]   30 years, you will have a phenomenally larger amount of money than you started with, because
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.700]   of the power of the stock market.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:03.680]   So you certainly don't presumably want to just wind up with a whole bunch of money at
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.260]   the end of that 30 years, you want to enjoy it along the way.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:15.440]   So for those two reasons, I say use 4% as a great guideline, and then monitor it as
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.180]   you go along.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.800]   In the unlikely event you hit a really bad sequence of return here when you first start
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:28.360]   out, and you need to adjust, and for the much more likely event that you start accumulating
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:35.440]   a lot of money that you could enjoy rather than just let it accumulate.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   Great sound advice.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.640]   And then the third part of that question was, can you talk about your thoughts on keeping
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.800]   an emergency fund?
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Oh, right.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.880]   Thank you for reminding me.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.920]   I think emergency funds depend largely on your situation.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:59.960]   I don't keep one myself, because, you know, I only have a small cottage, I have a relatively
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.000]   new car, I don't have a lot of things in my life that could suddenly cause me a big expense
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.120]   that I couldn't handle out of the normal course of money flowing through my checking account.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.760]   On the other hand, you know, if your savings rate is low, and I doubt that applies to too
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.920]   many people in this group, but if you're living pretty much paycheck to paycheck, maybe you
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:30.600]   have an older house that needs chronic repairs, maybe you drive an older car that might need
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.520]   unexpected repairs, then I think that's the time when you want to really think about an
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.720]   emergency fund.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.600]   But for a lot of people, and particularly I think people in the FI community, I think
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:50.320]   emergency funds are probably less important than they might be for somebody who is not
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.600]   as fiscally responsible as I'm guessing the people listening to this are.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   Okay.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   Great advice.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.680]   I would also, I think you're spot on in terms of this immediate crowd, but I think within
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.440]   the Bogleheads community, everyone's got friends, relatives, colleagues who come to them for
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.420]   advice on saving more efficiently, investing better.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:19.600]   So the broad spectrum of guidance is definitely welcome here.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.180]   So you mentioned home repairs as, you know, something a lot of people face, that's a great
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.400]   segue into real estate.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.920]   We mentioned the book you authored on real estate with the funny title.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.240]   Can you elaborate on, you know, your thoughts on when you think real estate's appropriate,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.880]   when it's not, and your own phrase of wings versus roots.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.720]   And how has your philosophy evolved over time, even if it's not in a single direction?
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:59.960]   So I kind of cringe at the concept that your personal residence is an investment.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:09.720]   In my view, you are probably, if your goal is to maximize your journey or to accelerate
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.520]   your journey to financial independence, you are probably better off renting just the space
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.040]   you need and diverting that money into something like VTSAX.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.880]   I think people convince themselves that their house is a great investment because they want
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.320]   to own a house.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.080]   In my world, the way I think about it, and I've owned houses, to be clear, most of my
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.600]   adult life, but I've never seen them as an investment.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.200]   I've made money on some of them, but I've always seen them as an expensive indulgence,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.960]   something that I only bought when I could easily afford it.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:54.120]   And because I felt for whatever reason at that point in my life, it enhanced my lifestyle
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.420]   and I was willing to spend the money to do it, like on any other indulgence.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.760]   Investment real estate, of course, is a different kind of animal.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.160]   You mentioned the second book, which is How I Lost Money in Real Estate Before It Was
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.600]   Fashionable.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.360]   That's the story of the very first piece of real estate I bought.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   It's finally, I can see the humor in it.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   So it's written to be a humorous story, almost a little bit of a miniature novel.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.160]   And you can learn from my mistakes.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:34.080]   The subtitle on that is a cautionary tale, because if you made a list of all the mistakes
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.960]   you could possibly make in buying real estate, well, I would have checked off all of those
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.920]   things in this particular purchase.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.640]   And for the sake of the story, it has the advantage of having in the process of owning
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:54.560]   it, because I couldn't get rid of it, morphing from a personal residence into a rental.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.800]   And if you want to invest in rental real estate, that's great, but probably backing into it
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.440]   because you can't sell your personal residence is not the way to go.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.560]   Sounds good.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.840]   So you mentioned learning the hard way.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.080]   We had a question from the community.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.320]   So let's say real estate lesson aside, what are other financial lessons you had to learn
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   the hard way?
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:31.240]   Well, I think the hardest lesson and the one that I wish I had corrected soonest is I was
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.120]   very slow to embrace index investing.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.640]   I started investing in 1975, which of course is a little bit ironically the year that Jack
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.960]   Bogle brought out the first index fund.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.760]   Now, I can't regret not buying that fund, because I didn't know about it at the time.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:59.520]   In fact, it was 10 years before I heard of indexing, and it was introduced to me by an
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.280]   old college buddy of mine, and that would have been 1985.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:11.400]   And that's when I should have embraced it, and if I were smarter and less stubborn and
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.920]   what have you, I probably would have, but I was a stock picker, and I was reasonably
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.040]   good at it, and I was making money at it.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:28.520]   In fact, I achieved financial independence doing that in 1989.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.020]   So I was kind of stubborn and a little bit arrogant, I suppose, and so I was very slow
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020]   to embrace it.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:41.360]   And there is something, I think, counterintuitive about the power of index investing, because
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.800]   you think if I only avoid the bad companies, I could certainly outperform the index, or
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.640]   I just focus on the clearly the best companies, and they'll outperform.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.200]   Well, of course, we know that research teaches us that those best companies are sometimes
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.880]   tomorrow's Enrons, and those dogs are sometimes tomorrow's exciting turnaround stories.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.640]   So actually outperforming the index, especially over any period of time, is extraordinarily
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   difficult.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.440]   But at least for me, that felt very counterintuitive, so it took me a long time to embrace it.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:21.680]   And again, I think part of the problem is it's not like picking individual stocks doesn't
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   work.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.880]   Of course, sometimes it doesn't, but it does work.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.840]   So you're not comparing something that doesn't work to something that does.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:37.480]   You're comparing two things that work, one of which just works better, and with a whole
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   lot less effort.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.040]   And of course, that's index investing.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:53.120]   So I wish that I had first heard of Mr. Bogle's creation in 1975 and been smart enough to
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   embrace it.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.460]   But failing that, I wish that I'd embraced it in 1985 when I first heard about it.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.160]   My investment road would have been easier and more profitable.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   Understood.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.400]   Yeah, and that definitely resonates with this crowd.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   So we had a question about overcoming cognitive biases from the community.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.120]   So can we explore a bit more what you just spoke about?
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.720]   So apart from the kind of intellectual information, like higher probability of index investing,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:33.120]   like you said, can you talk about overcoming cognitive biases in a way that when people--
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.880]   most people, almost by definition, people don't know when they're wrong, right?
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.160]   They wouldn't consciously, intentionally have a wrong view.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:47.400]   Can you talk about how folks make this journey, or in your own experience, from having bad
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   information or being misinformed, transitioning to a better understanding or seeking or embracing
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.600]   disconfirming information?
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   Yeah, I'm not a psychologist, so I'm not sure that I'm qualified to talk about that.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.000]   My personal observations in listening to people-- I remember in my business career, I had the
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.120]   occasion to go to Las Vegas on a regular basis for shows and conventions and what have you.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.720]   And of course, when people go to Las Vegas, they gamble.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:30.120]   And it was remarkable to me that almost everybody-- and these are my customers and my colleagues--
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:36.600]   would report that they made money in the casinos, that they won on a consistent basis.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.320]   And I'd look up at these billion-dollar casinos and think, wow, there are a whole lot of people
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.080]   who are smarter than I am, because I didn't win in the casino.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.320]   Now, to be clear, occasionally I did, because the casinos are set up so that people do win
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.540]   on a regular basis.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.960]   But nobody, I think, wins consistently.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:06.400]   But they fool themselves, because the sensation of winning is so intoxicating that you tend
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.720]   to block out the times when you lost.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.480]   I think that's true of picking stocks.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.800]   In fact, for me at least, it was even more true than-- casinos have never particularly
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.300]   appealed to me, because it's so biased in favor of the house.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.060]   But there is nothing in my experience, or very few things in my experience, that are
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:35.680]   more intoxicating than researching a company, deciding that, yeah, this is worth buying
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.040]   the stock, and being proven right, and letting it ratch up.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.480]   So I think I'll take some pride in the fact that I was always clear-eyed enough to recognize
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:54.080]   my mistakes, and to realize that even though I picked some winners-- and maybe I can even
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:00.520]   go so far to say the winners did better than the losers, because as I say, I did make money
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   doing it-- but I was always aware of the drag the losers represented on my portfolio.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.720]   And sometimes when I talk to people, whether it's about their gambling in Vegas or their
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.800]   stock portfolio, I wonder about their memory.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.000]   Makes sense.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So on a related note, within financial independence-- and you spoke about saving, and investing,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.480]   and doing well with stocks ultimately-- Jack Bogle famously wrote a book called Enough.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.520]   Can you share with us your concept of enough?
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.960]   We have a lot of people who work indefinitely, they save and invest indefinitely, they may
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.880]   have trouble spending and not working.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   Can you elaborate on your idea of enough?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:54.020]   So I might, at least to some extent, fall into that category.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:32:03.480]   And I'm not sure that-- I don't say that in that it's a good thing, necessarily.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.960]   But personally, I've just never been enamored with owning things.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.760]   I guess I've never been particularly materialistic.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:20.800]   So in my business career, when I wasn't driving as fancy a car as my peers in the business
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.420]   world were driving, sometimes for the sake of my career, I thought that was a mistake
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.420]   on my part.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.640]   But that's just not something I wanted.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   We lived in a very nice house, but it wasn't necessarily the fanciest house that we could
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:43.760]   live in, or the house that my peers in my business career were living in at the time.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.320]   So I was a little bit always out of step with that.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.480]   I always liked work.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.240]   And to this day-- and I think that's one of the reasons I'm very grateful that I found
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:59.600]   this FI World, and that I just by happenstance started this blog, and then the Chautauqua's,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.280]   and then wrote the book.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   I find work extraordinarily satisfying.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.760]   I am, frankly, better at work than I am at play.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:16.600]   And that caused a little psychological stress at times, because there is a drumbeat that
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.400]   you should prefer play and relaxation.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   So you combine those things, and you do wind up accumulating money.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.120]   My solution is to give it away, which is satisfying in and of itself.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.600]   But I think that-- I'm not recommending this path.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:46.560]   I think the better path would be to have more balance than perhaps I've had in my own life.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:53.840]   And recognizing that there is a certain point where, depending on your own particular situation
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.000]   and needs, and how you feel about things, where you have enough money, and accumulating
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.760]   more money doesn't add anything to your life.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.600]   And as the old saying goes, you can't take it with you.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:14.240]   So I am absolutely a believer in the concept of enough.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.120]   And I think it's a healthy way to look at things.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   Excellent.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   All right.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.200]   So we've spoken about retirees a bit.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.760]   The crowd here also has some newcomers to the space.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.400]   So they're just beginning their journey.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.360]   Thinking about the title of your book, "The Simple Path to Wealth," can you elaborate
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   on this idea that the simplicity of it has its own appeal, but it's not just the simplicity
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:48.640]   of it that's the appeal, the powerful result of being simple?
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.080]   That may not be intuitive to folks new to the space.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   Right.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:59.960]   So as I mentioned, I think, earlier in the conversation, I basically wrote the book for
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   my daughter.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.640]   And she came home from college one day, and of course, I was still trying to engage her
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:15.120]   in conversations about these things, even though I managed to turn her off to it, pushing
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   too hard previously.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.840]   And at one point, she said to me, she said, "You know, Dad, I get it.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:27.360]   I understand this is important stuff, but I don't want to have to think about it all
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.800]   the time."
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.120]   And that was an epiphany for me, because I realized that I love thinking about this stuff
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.240]   all the time.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   But she, like a lot of people, had more important things to do with her life than think about
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   investing in money.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:50.220]   And the wonderful thing about investing is the truth is that if you do the simplest things,
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.320]   you will get the more powerful results.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:00.920]   And if you identify those few simple things, and you put yourself on that path and set
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.680]   it on autopilot, and then otherwise forget about it, that's a superpower.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.280]   My daughter, for instance, probably doesn't even know the market's down 20% because she
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.080]   just doesn't care.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.680]   But she's on the path.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.840]   She puts money into BTSAX every month.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.240]   And that's her superpower.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:30.280]   Her lack of paying attention to it is going to keep her from panicking and selling.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.160]   It's going to save her from the temptation to constantly tinker.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.000]   And if the research is indicative of anything, it's that the more you tinker with your investments,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.520]   the less well you will do.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.600]   It's kind of remarkable when you think about it, because I don't believe there is anything
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:53.580]   else in our life where if we put in less effort, we get a better result.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.320]   If you want to be a woodworker, the more effort you put into it, the better woodworker you
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.280]   will be.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.200]   That's true of almost anything we can think of.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:10.840]   But with investing, the more you tinker with it, the worse your results are likely to be.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:16.980]   I liken it to, imagine if you had a banquet table that was just filled with all kinds
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.960]   of exotic dishes on it, and in one tiny corner of that table were the core nutritious foods
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.800]   that you really need that are good for you, that your body needs.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.720]   What's analogous to all of the investment products that Wall Street offers, a lot of
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:40.320]   them are extraordinarily exotic and difficult to make, and of course, that's by design.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.640]   So you're driven into their arms for high fees to sort through all that stuff.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.600]   Well, the truth is, just like with the food on the table, you can put your arm down in
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.940]   front of those handful of very simple foods.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.920]   And sweep everything else onto the floor because you don't need it.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:03.560]   And you can do that, the same thing in the world of investing, and sweep everything onto
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:09.880]   the floor except for broad-based, low-cost index funds.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:15.800]   Which is the great gift that Jack Bogle gave us, and it's the reason that I call him a
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   fiscal saint.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.140]   Jack Bogle has done more, and I know I'm preaching to the choir with this group, but Jack Bogle
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:30.840]   has done more for the average investor than anybody before or since because he created
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:42.240]   the only thing that we really need to get outstanding results, and ironically, with
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.440]   the least possible effort.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.840]   It is amazing and ironic.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.040]   So I want to be sensitive of your time and the audience's time so that we wrap up this
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.780]   portion of the session with one more question from the community, and then I'll turn it
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:06.140]   over to Lucas and Miriam, who have consolidated some of the common theme questions from the
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.060]   chat from the live audience.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:13.100]   So that last question, you mentioned the market went down.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.700]   So the question is, what are three of the biggest financial challenges you see facing
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.540]   retirees today?
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:29.020]   Well, I think that the biggest one, at least for anybody who is going to follow my approach,
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.120]   the simple path to wealth, is staying the course.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:40.420]   When I started writing in 2011, the market really has done nothing but march straight
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   upwards.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:47.500]   You know, it dropped a little bit in COVID, but it recovered almost instantly.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:54.720]   This drop that seemed to have everybody in a panic is, you know, it's 20%.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:00.100]   It's a very mild bear market, at least so far.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:06.820]   And I think that most or a lot of investors out there really haven't experienced a sharp
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.820]   decline.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:12.680]   And they don't perhaps fully appreciate the fact that nobody can predict them with any
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.780]   accuracy and that they are a very normal part of the process.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:23.140]   If you are going to reap the benefits of investing in stocks, then you have to accept the fact
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.860]   that periodically the stock market is going to plunge.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.140]   It's a volatile, it's not a smooth ride, it's very volatile.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.460]   And you have to stay the course.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:39.980]   I tell people, when the market drops, and it will, if you panic and sell, you do not
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.940]   want to be following my advice, it will leave you bleeding by the side of the road.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.340]   You have to stay the course.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.980]   And so I think that's probably the biggest obstacle as to whether people can just hear
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:41:00.900]   somebody like me say that and take it to heart and endure the volatility, which, of course,
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.900]   is very unpleasant.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.820]   It's very scary.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:09.180]   Or whether they actually have to live through panicking, selling, watching the market turn
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:14.060]   around and leave them behind and having to get in later.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:21.220]   But I tell people, it's like living in Florida and being surprised when hurricanes come.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.860]   Hurricanes are unpleasant, they're potentially very dangerous and destructive, but you shouldn't
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.580]   be surprised that if you're going to live in Florida, that you're going to have to deal
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   with them.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:35.740]   It's the same thing investing in the stock market with bear markets.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.820]   So that makes sense.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.220]   Before I turn it over to Miriam and Lucas, let's explore that a little more.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.780]   Because I think intellectually, people can hear this, that table stakes, the price of
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.300]   entry is the roller coaster.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:54.060]   But if all folks have experienced overall is the upward trending market, like you described,
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:00.420]   it's natural that they might think their actual risk tolerance is higher than it really is.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:07.540]   How do you suggest people learn their true risk tolerance to the extent they can in advance
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.860]   of a market correction?
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   So I don't know that I have the answer to that question.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:20.540]   That's kind of what I was saying or trying to say is, I don't know how many people can
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.780]   read about it and take it to heart.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:30.180]   And I think you're correct that a lot of people, especially when all you've experienced, and
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:38.700]   there are a lot of adults that have come of age and only experienced this last 10 years,
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.380]   I think it's one thing to intellectually say, "Well, of course I can handle when it drops."
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:50.460]   But it's one thing to know it in your head, it's another thing to know it in your gut.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.020]   And I think what it requires, I mean, the advice I would give to people is to really
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:01.700]   sit back and think about it, and I think a lot of people don't, they kind of dismiss
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.060]   and say, "Okay, I can handle it."
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:12.900]   For instance, if you go back to '07, '08, '09, that debacle, I remember, of course we
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:20.980]   know historically that the market hit bottom in, I think, March of '09, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:30.180]   and it was at 666, which is a memorable number, of course, and it had lost, I don't know,
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.100]   50% of its value at that point.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.140]   So it's easy for people to look at that and say, "Oh, okay, well, I think I could handle
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.300]   losing 50% of my value, the value of my portfolio."
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.420]   Wouldn't be happy about it, but I think you can tolerate that.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:51.140]   But now understand this, that in March of '09, all of the smart people I was talking
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.820]   to thought the market was going to go much lower.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.140]   I mean, they were talking about it dropping another two-thirds.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.300]   Nobody that I heard was saying, "Oh, now we're at the bottom."
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.540]   So think about it this way.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:11.980]   Let's suppose that you had started with a portfolio of a million two, and in March of
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:19.280]   '09, the market's been cut in half and your portfolio is now 600,000.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.940]   What you're hearing is not, "It's the bottom, it's going to turn around and get better."
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:28.740]   What you're hearing is the market's going to continue to go down another two-thirds,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   which means your million two is potentially going to be $200,000.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.460]   Walk that scenario through your head and say, "Would I stay the course?"
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:48.500]   And I think maybe that's the only sobering way I can think about looking at this, short
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.660]   of going through it yourself.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.660]   Okay.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.660]   Thanks for that.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.660]   A great exercise.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:58.860]   So, as mentioned, I'll turn it over now to Miriam and Lucas, who will share questions
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   from the chat.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:05.980]   Jim, we'll reconnect and close the meeting later, but before turning it over, I want
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.300]   to thank you again for sharing your incredible insights and timeless wisdom.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.300]   I appreciate it.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:15.320]   As I said at the beginning, I appreciate the invitation.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.900]   You asked some really interesting questions that I haven't gotten before, so I thank you
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:20.900]   for that.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.900]   Sure.
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.340]   And they're largely sourced from the Bogleheads community, so thanks for the feedback.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.140]   So Miriam or Lucas, I'll turn it over to you.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.300]   Sure.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.700]   So I'll ask the first question.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.260]   JL, Collins, thanks for coming on, by the way, big fan.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:48.420]   So the first question we had was from Garrett, and these are in the chat, by the way, and
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.180]   this is a question for mid-career folks.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.300]   And the question is, "When do you stop living like in your 20s, which is spending very little
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:04.460]   with lots of delayed gratification, and start 'living' like you want to?"
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:13.620]   I'm always torn between being frustrated for delaying gratification for 10-plus years now,
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:19.660]   but also worrying if I start spending that something will go wrong, example, a recession
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.700]   leading to a job loss.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.540]   So any thoughts on that?
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.540]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:31.900]   So I think that, again, is going to be a very personal decision for each individual.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:38.580]   So probably the best way I can talk about it is how I did it.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:45.500]   And remember, when I started on my journey there, I had no concept of financial independence.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.260]   I was wandering in the wilderness, if you will.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:57.260]   But for whatever reason, I decided that financial, I wanted to have, I'd come across the concept
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:02.820]   of having a few money, which was not enough money to never work again, but enough money
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.740]   that I could make bolder decisions, that I could always leave the job if I wanted to
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:13.060]   go do something else, or if I just didn't want to work for that company or that particular
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.180]   boss.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.940]   So that was the goal that I had, such as it was.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.660]   So I decided out of college, when I got my first professional job, I was going to live
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.500]   on half of my income, and that's what I did.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:33.980]   My first professional job paid me $10,000 a year, and I lived on $5,000 a year, and
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.100]   I invested the other $5,000.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:43.500]   But then as my career progressed, of course, I started making more money, but I kept that
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.980]   ratio the same.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.820]   So my lifestyle did inflate.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:54.940]   So in a few years, when I was making $20,000 a year, well, now I'm investing $10,000,
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.620]   but I'm living on twice what I was living on before.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.220]   And that worked out well for me, and right up the march where I was making $30,000, $40,000,
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:13.500]   $50,000 into six figures, I was still doing the half and half thing, and my material life
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.500]   expanded with it.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:22.060]   But again, this is coming from somebody who never has had a very high regard for material
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:29.780]   things other than travel is, I guess, where I spend money the most.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:38.380]   But I also kind of cringe at this idea that you're not living your life if you're not
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.420]   spending money.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:46.140]   I never felt deprived when I was going through this.
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:51.660]   I think most people would say, "Well, if I'm not spending, there's half of my money, my
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.980]   income that I'm not spending.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.300]   That feels like deprivation."
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:49:01.820]   It never felt like deprivation because, again, when I came out of college, $5,000 a year
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:07.260]   was a lot of money, and then it kept growing on the spending side.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:13.420]   So I think if there's somebody listening who thinks that there's no satisfaction to be
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:19.580]   had in life unless they're spending as much money as they possibly can, I would urge them
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.980]   to think about that a little more deeply.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.980]   Great.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.980]   Great.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.980]   Thanks.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.500]   Would you like to read the second one, Ma'am?
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   Yes.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:36.940]   We have a question about bonds, and the question is, "Why bonds as a ballast when the return
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.780]   is so poor, not much better than cash?
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:47.660]   Is there some alternative you would recommend instead of bonds to use instead?"
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:54.060]   And then I have an additional question to that because I understand that you recommend
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.540]   mostly stocks for young people.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:02.140]   When would you add bonds to the portfolio?
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:07.580]   What thinking would you have in relation to this question, bonds as ballast versus bonds
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.300]   as return?
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.100]   Right.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:16.940]   So bonds as ballast has not been working out real well in recent history, as I think we
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   all know.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:23.020]   I mentioned earlier in this conversation that a couple of days ago I just shifted some money
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:30.620]   out of bonds and into stocks, and I don't remember the exact numbers, but the bond portfolio
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:37.300]   was down 10%, 11%, but the stock portfolio was down 22%.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:43.260]   So would I have preferred that the bond portfolio was up a little bit, which would be the ideal
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   situation with ballast or even flat, obviously.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.620]   But we're in kind of a unique economic environment, and right now bonds are getting hammered at
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:51:01.500]   the same time that stocks are, but not quite as hard, and so I still think of them as being
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:08.060]   ballast, although it's not performing as well as I would like, because in terms of what
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:15.100]   else to use, I honestly don't know the answer to that question, considering that I believe
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.320]   in playing the long game.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:24.180]   So in the long game, if you owned bonds in BBTLX, the total bond market fund that Vanguard
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:30.020]   offers, it's, of course, gotten hurt pretty badly, but what you need to understand is
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:35.820]   that's a portfolio with thousands of bonds in it of all different maturities, and at
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:42.380]   any given time, some of those bonds are coming due, and that money will be reinvested in
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.860]   new bonds at higher interest rates.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:50.820]   So slowly but surely, that bond fund, along with all bond funds, will be paying more and
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.720]   more interest, and it'll recover in that fashion.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.540]   So I kind of see it as a rockier road than I would have hoped for with bonds.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.860]   If you told me that we were going to have the kind of inflation we're having a few years
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:11.980]   ago, I would have said, "Yeah, that's the road that bonds have ahead of us," but I don't
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.700]   have a crystal ball.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:22.280]   In terms of when to add bonds, again, this depends a little bit on someone's risk tolerance.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:30.540]   So personally, when I stepped away from the workforce in 2011, that's when I added bonds.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:36.740]   Now the risk to that, of course, is the stock market could have immediately tanked.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:45.220]   My timing could have been very bad, and then I would have had to use depressed stock prices,
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.420]   sell stocks at depressed levels, to buy those bonds.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:54.980]   But the truth is, the market doesn't tank aggressively all that often, so I was willing
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.980]   to roll those dice.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:02.020]   If someone is less willing to roll those dice, then what I would say is, "We'll start edging
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.220]   into whatever bond position you run over the course of five years before you're going to
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:12.220]   be needing to live on in the portfolio."
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.220]   Great.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220]   Thank you.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:22.500]   Okay, so the next question that we had is in regards to mutual funds versus ETFs.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:28.780]   So earlier, you were speaking about the bonds mutual fund, the total bonds mutual fund,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.940]   and then also VTSAX versus VTI.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.300]   Advantages, disadvantages, what are your thoughts there?
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:42.820]   So I'm an old guy, and when I started investing in these things, there were no ETFs, and so
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:50.860]   I think in terms of VTSAX, I think in terms of the mutual fund.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.820]   I was a little resistant to ETFs when they first came out because there were some trading
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.020]   costs associated with them.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:04.820]   And my understanding is they were created specifically to make trading these assets
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:09.580]   more easier and more effective, and I'm not a trader.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:14.060]   I mean, when I buy VTSAX, my holding period is literally forever.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:20.380]   I mean, the only time I would ever sell it is to sell off a couple of shares, perhaps
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:24.660]   to make ends meet if I'm living on the portfolio.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.900]   So I see absolutely no value in trading, and I have no need for it.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:36.380]   So the ETFs, there was never any reason for me to switch to them.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:41.780]   Now having said all that, the trading costs have come way down, as I understand it.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:47.580]   You can, of course, if you're new to the game and you have relatively little money to invest,
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:53.300]   I think the minimum on VTSAX is $3,000 these days.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:57.620]   You can get into VTI with the cost of a share.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:02.980]   I have no idea what a share of VTI costs these days, but considerably less than $3,000.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.820]   So perhaps it's a little easier entry point.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:12.860]   I guess the bottom line is it doesn't really make any difference, as long as you're going
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:17.220]   to hold either one for the long term.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:23.780]   Whether you own VTI or VTSAX, you have exactly the same portfolio, and bottom line is that's
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.780]   what matters.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.780]   Great.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   Great.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.780]   Thanks.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:34.500]   Miriam, did you want to ask another?
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.380]   We have another question from the chat.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:43.220]   It is, "Should we be doing anything different in anticipation that the U.S. may experience
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:53.740]   an extended period of high inflation, for example, 10 years of 8% to 10% inflation?"
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:56:00.060]   And may I add that I'm an old lady, and when we first bought our first house, my husband
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:05.780]   and I, our mortgage was about 16%.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:14.380]   And my first IRA, I opened in 1981, and I put it in a regular money market fund, and
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.300]   it was paying about 16%, 17%, 19%.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   Right.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:28.940]   Well, I lived through those days as well, and I remember those money market fund rates
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:34.280]   and those interest rates, as I had both of those myself.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.380]   You know, I think not.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:45.540]   I think that, you know, if you're in this for the long term, and in my view, that's
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:51.660]   the only way you should be investing in stocks, and as I've said a couple of times now, I
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:59.980]   own VTSAX forever, you know, once stocks get through the shock of the Fed raising interest
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:07.740]   rates and the potential that that will trigger a recession, which it probably will, and that
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:13.660]   will slow down the economy and slow down the sales and profits of companies.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:22.300]   Once companies get past that, just like once the bonds get past the shock of the fast rising
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:28.380]   interest rates and begin to buy the new bonds with the higher rates and provide those higher
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:34.500]   interest rates on the fund, you're going to find that stocks are actually a pretty good
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.940]   inflation hedge, because you're not just buying pieces of paper or bits on a computer that
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.340]   are just there to be traded.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:48.580]   You are, in a very real sense, owning pieces of real, genuine, active businesses that have
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:55.140]   assets, that have products, that have services, that have pricing power, that can serve you
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.460]   well in keeping pace with inflation.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:06.580]   So I look back in the 1970s, which is when I came of age and first began investing, and
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.540]   that was a very difficult time for the market.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:17.180]   It was a time of very high inflation, as Miriam was just pointing out, but it was also a wonderful
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:24.980]   time to be adding to something like VTSA, which VTSAX didn't exist in those days, but
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:30.860]   adding to the S&P 500 fund that Mr. Vogel had first created would have been a wonderful
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:35.060]   time to be accumulating shares.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.660]   As the old saying goes, you want to be buying when there's blood in the streets, and there
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.460]   was certainly blood in the streets in those days.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:49.460]   You had, I think it was business week in 1978, had a famous cover called The Death of Equities.
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:54.580]   And if you ever see a magazine cover like that, I think you could be pretty sure you're
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   near the bottom of whatever terrible thing is going on.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:06.340]   So no, I'm very comfortable continuing on the same path that I've laid out and that
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.340]   I've been on for decades.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:14.100]   And in fact, if anything, over time, I think it'll be even more powerful because this is
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:18.940]   a wonderful time to be accumulating shares in VTSAX.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:23.260]   Thank you.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:30.580]   And along those lines, that segues into a question from one of our friends over in France.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:37.100]   So what, in your opinion, is the best way to attract younger people in their 20s and
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.060]   30s to more of a saving mentality?
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.020]   And this is asking for a friend.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:53.280]   Yeah, so I don't, again, I think that's a question that's kind of above my pay grade.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   I don't know.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.340]   I don't quite know how to do that.
[00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:06.900]   I think that it is remarkable to me watching what has happened in the FI world since 2011
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:12.740]   when I first launched my blog, and then with Bogleheads, the sources of information that
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.020]   are available are just extraordinary.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:22.860]   And, you know, I think about when I started my journey and I was kind of wandering in
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.500]   the wilderness, and frankly, it all felt wrong.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.020]   It felt like I was doing things wrong because everybody else was living paycheck to paycheck
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.420]   and spending all their money.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:42.220]   But now, if you have any inclination to consider a different way of living, a different path,
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:46.900]   the amount of role models you have out there, the amount of information that you have out
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.260]   there is really unlimited.
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:54.860]   So I suppose if I were trying to persuade somebody, and I'm notorious for saying I've
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:01:01.660]   never tried to persuade anybody but one person, my daughter, of anything along these lines.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:05.900]   And by the way, I've succeeded, so I feel good about that.
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:11.820]   But if I were trying to persuade somebody, I suppose I would, and I'm going to be self-serving
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:19.180]   here, is steer them to my blog, to the stock series, and/or to the book.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.940]   But at that point, it's going to be up to them.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.500]   But yeah, I'm certainly not an expert in trying to persuade people.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:32.980]   I think the people who I've influenced are people who have come to my work and for whom
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:39.220]   it's resonated, and they've continued on on their own.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220]   Great.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.900]   Well, you've influenced me, I'll tell you that much.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.100]   Well, there you go.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.100]   Any others?
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.220]   Miriam, did you want to ask any others from the chat?
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220]   Yes, we can.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.580]   We can also open it up to questions for the raised hand.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:06.220]   Let me see on the chat, we have a question about IBONs and whether you own IBONs.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.220]   Would you add those to your portfolio?
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:17.540]   So it's interesting, I fielded that question on, it must be on my Facebook today, and maybe
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:22.660]   a week ago, I fielded it on my Twitter account.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.100]   IBONs pay an extraordinarily high interest rate, they're government issued bonds, just
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:30.340]   so everybody knows what we're talking about.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.280]   But you can only buy $10,000 worth of them.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:40.380]   So my answer to the question is, it depends on how important or how big a portion of your
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.740]   portfolio $10,000 is.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:49.460]   If it's a meaningful portion of your portfolio, then by all means, it's you're not going to
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:56.020]   get a guaranteed 9% or whatever it is elsewhere.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.680]   But if you're further along in your journey, then $10,000 is probably a rounding error.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.780]   So for that, I think you need other tools for your heavy lifting.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.500]   Then of course, no matter where you're on your journey, I suppose, if you want to make
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.020]   the effort, even for $10,000, why not?
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.980]   Great.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.780]   There was another question that we received in the chat.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.660]   You mentioned giving your money away.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:34.980]   What do you choose to donate to, to give away?
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:44.140]   Well, I don't know how deep we want to go into that, and I kind of consider it a little
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:53.420]   bit private, but interestingly, I did another interview earlier today and was asked the
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.420]   same question.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:04:01.980]   Maybe Jim, I'll insert just to clarify, and I respect that you're keeping the details
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:06.500]   private, but if you can talk about how you make philanthropic decisions, because I think
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.460]   the crowd here as retirees, that's a growing interest for them.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:18.180]   Well, I'm happy to talk about this one particular charity because I did in this other interview
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.660]   earlier today.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:28.220]   There's a charity based in Salt Lake City called Adopt a Native Elder, and most of their
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:32.620]   work is done on the Navajo reservation.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:39.260]   Poverty levels on reservations are by and large extraordinarily high.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:44.180]   It's one of the most impoverished groups in the country.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:49.420]   The elderly on the Navajo reservation tend to be deeply in poverty.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:56.540]   They tend to be living far out in rural areas with very little access.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:02.460]   They tend not to have running water or electricity or things like that.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:13.300]   This organization reaches out to those people with things like food and firewood and water,
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.860]   and also materials.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:22.820]   They can be wonderful craftspeople, and so yarn for weaving rugs that then the organization
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:28.100]   will help the market and create a little bit of cash flow that way.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:35.660]   It's a charity that I'm very fond of, and I put a fair amount of support behind.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:41.500]   Interestingly enough, I started supporting them a number of years ago, and they were
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:47.940]   not rated on any of the charity rating organizations.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.820]   It was a little bit of a gamble, I guess, for me, because I'm the kind of person who
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:57.740]   likes to analyze everything to death, and so I was a little uncomfortable that I couldn't
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:02.340]   find them on any of those organizations, but I chalked that up to the fact that they were
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.900]   pretty small and probably didn't have the resources to go through the paperwork.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   I just liked the way they talked about the work that they did.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:16.700]   Well, now they are rated on Charity Navigator and have been for a few years, and I was delighted
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:22.100]   when I first saw that because they have absolutely top-notch ratings when it comes to efficiency
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:30.220]   and what have you, so if anybody is looking...
