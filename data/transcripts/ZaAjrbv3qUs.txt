[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   All right, we have another question here.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.240]   This one comes from Sam.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.960]   Sam says, "Does having occasional productivity leaks
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   "mean that there might be an undiscovered system
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.420]   "that might work even better than what you're doing?"
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.240]   So productivity leaks, what Sam means by this is
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.120]   some things get forgotten
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.120]   or you fall off the system for a little bit.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.960]   And in his elaboration, he makes clear,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   he wants to know, is this a problem?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.120]   And he was struggling.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.240]   He went through some hard periods with time block planning.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.480]   So that was his particular motivation for those questions.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.320]   He was like, "Is there things better?
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.280]   "Does that mean time block planning
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   "is not the right system for me?"
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640]   So Sam, I would say, usually the answer here would be no.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   So unless your work is very repeatable and rigidly defined,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.400]   I mean, you just do one thing
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.640]   and you do it in the same way every time,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.860]   you're never gonna have a consistent, perfect match
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.520]   with your productivity systems.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.600]   There'll be periods in which, let's say things are missed,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.880]   there'll be periods where you fall off of the system
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.320]   for a while.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.480]   Like, so maybe you get crushed all of a sudden
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.860]   with some unexpected, big, urgent work,
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.400]   or there's a family emergency, or you get sick.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.800]   I mean, there's all sorts of things that can happen
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.880]   that are gonna knock you off
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640]   of some of your productivity systems.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.920]   None of that's a problem.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.520]   None of that, I think, is a sign
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600]   that your productivity system is somehow wrong.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.480]   That's to be expected.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.840]   Again, unless you're super rigid.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.640]   I write one book every two years.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520]   All I do is I write every morning.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   And like, if you're super rigid,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.200]   then maybe you worry about it.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.120]   But otherwise, there will be unforeseen circumstances
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.680]   and events in your work when your systems
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   won't fully rise to the challenge.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.280]   So what you are supposed to do in that situation
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.160]   is recover and regroup when you next get a chance.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   So you're crushed by this emergency that happens at work.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.500]   You fall off of your systems.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.960]   The emergency concludes.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.120]   You take a slow half day in the morning
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.260]   to get back on track.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.200]   Let me clear out things, get my new weekly plan,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.800]   get my task boards up and running,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.080]   or whatever it is that you're using.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.840]   Get back to doing my time block planning.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.240]   You recover and you regroup
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.640]   the next time you are able to come up for air.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   A corollary of that is don't beat yourself up
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440]   during the hard time.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.160]   Oh my God, why am I not time blocking?
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.560]   Oh my God, why am I not time blocking today?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960]   What about tomorrow?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.280]   Hey, when you're in the emergency,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.200]   when you're in the hard period,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020]   when you're in the unusual circumstances,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320]   just you do what you need to do.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.620]   The advantages of these systems aggregate
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.880]   over long periods of time.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.280]   It's not a chain that if you break it, you lose everything.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.400]   So you recover and regroup.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640]   Now, when you do that regrouping,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.440]   sure, that's a time when you can ask,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.240]   is there tweaks that need to be made?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.760]   You might look at your overall system
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.960]   and say this little piece of it here,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   I'm consistently not coming back to that,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.160]   or that's not really helping, so let me get rid of that.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   Or, you know, here's why I'm falling off
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   my time block plans.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.580]   Now that I have time to recover and regroup,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.520]   I see what I'm doing is I'm over blocking.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.140]   I'm building these impossible plans
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.220]   so the slightest issue makes them fall apart
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.680]   and it's so dispiriting
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360]   that I don't even bother blocking anymore
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.680]   when things get even a little bit hard,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.280]   so I need to be looser in my blocking.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.520]   Or I need to automate more
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.940]   so that my schedule's easier to handle.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.800]   So when you recover and regroup, you might tweak.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.760]   Now, what are the signs that your system is truly broken?
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.920]   You might need to really rethink how you do your work.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.040]   If you stop using it altogether for long periods of time
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.580]   that persist past acute circumstances,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.000]   that is a warning sign.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.960]   So if you just don't go back to your system at all,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.600]   even though you're not in some sort of emergency,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.800]   you're not crushed by a workload,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.560]   there's not some unusual things happening,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.300]   you just find yourself not using it months at a time,
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.760]   now you might need to rethink what you're doing.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.200]   Similarly, if you're using it
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.080]   but it feels completely ritualistic and arbitrary,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.400]   like the equivalent of doing prayer beads
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120]   and setting up crystals in your office.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.680]   Like, I don't know, I have these lists
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   that I write things on, I have to color code them
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.960]   and I move things over this thing,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.160]   I'm just kind of doing it rotely,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.120]   it's not really even impacting how I work,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.020]   that's another sign you need to change your system.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.960]   So there are signs that your system is truly broken,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.920]   but if you just have temporary leaks, that's just normal.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.620]   That means you have a normal job.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.120]   (upbeat music)
