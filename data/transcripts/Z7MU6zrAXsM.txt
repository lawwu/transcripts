[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.600]   Today, my guest is Dr. Eddie Chang.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.440]   Dr. Eddie Chang is the chair of the neurosurgery department
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.720]   at the University of California at San Francisco.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.300]   Dr. Chang's clinical group focuses on the treatment
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.040]   of movement disorders, including epilepsy.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.080]   He is also a world expert in the treatment
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.680]   of speech disorders and relieving paralysis
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.440]   that prevents speech and other forms
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.320]   of movement and communication.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   Indeed, his laboratory is credited with discovering ways
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.060]   to allow people who have fully locked in syndrome,
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.040]   that is who cannot speak or move,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.240]   to communicate through computers and AI devices
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.000]   in order to be able to speak to others in their world
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.720]   and understand what others are saying to them.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   It is a truly remarkable achievement that we discussed today
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.760]   in addition to his discoveries about critical periods,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.860]   which are periods of time during one's life
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.360]   when one can learn things in particular languages
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.880]   with great ease, as opposed to later in life.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.760]   And we talk about the basis of things like bilingualism
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.140]   and trilingualism.
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440]   We talk about how the brain controls movement
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.000]   of the very muscles that allow for speech and language
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.080]   and how those can be modified over time.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.480]   We also talk about stutter,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.200]   and we talk about a number of aspects of speech and language
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.520]   that give insight into not just how we create
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.000]   this incredible thing called speech
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.300]   or how we understand speech and language,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340]   but how the brain works more generally.
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.160]   Dr. Chang is also one of the world leaders
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.540]   in bioengineering, that is the creation of devices
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.420]   that allow the brain to function
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.040]   at super physiological levels
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.060]   and that can allow people with various syndromes
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.760]   and disorders to overcome their deficits.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.360]   So if you are somebody who is interested
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.300]   in how the brain works normally,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.920]   how it breaks down and how it can be repaired,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.700]   and if you are interested in speech and language,
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.600]   reading and comprehension of information of any kind,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   today's episode ought to include some information
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.580]   of deep interest to you.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.320]   Dr. Chang is indeed the top of his field
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020]   in terms of understanding these issues
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.940]   of how the brain encodes speech and language
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.780]   and create speech and language,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780]   and as I mentioned, movement disorders and epilepsy.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.160]   We even talk about things such as the ketogenic diet,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.440]   the future of companies like Neuralink,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.480]   which are interested in bioengineering
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   and augmenting the human brain, and much more.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.400]   One thing that I would like to note is that
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.220]   in addition to being a world-class neuroscience researcher
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.760]   and world-class clinician neurosurgeon,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.240]   and chair of neurosurgery, Dr. Eddie Chang
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.860]   has also been a close personal friend of mine
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.440]   since we were nine years old.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.320]   We attended elementary school together,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.460]   and we actually had a science club
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.520]   when we were nine years old,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   focused on a very particular topic.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900]   You'll have to listen in to today's episode
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.440]   to discover what that topic was
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   and what membership to that club required.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.340]   That aside, Dr. Chang is an absolute phenom
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.360]   with respect to his scientific prowess,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   that is both his research and his clinical abilities,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.320]   and he's one of these rare individuals
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.440]   that whenever he opens his mouth, we learn.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.040]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.760]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.680]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.520]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.880]   to the general public.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.920]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.540]   Our first sponsor is Levels.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.080]   Levels is a program that helps you see
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.700]   how different foods affect your health
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.920]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.420]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.600]   I started using Levels about one year ago.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.120]   The Levels Monitor allowed me to see
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.480]   how different foods change my blood sugar level
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.100]   or my blood glucose level.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.900]   This turns out to be immensely important
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.040]   for being able to predict how, for instance,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   certain foods will affect your energy level,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.560]   your ability to exercise,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.420]   your ability to recover from exercise,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.160]   and how it will affect other hormones
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.960]   like testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, and so forth.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.040]   The other thing about using a Levels Monitor
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.060]   is that it gave me insight into how food and exercise
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.160]   and other activities and even how well I was sleeping
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.580]   or how poorly I might happen to be sleeping
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.520]   impact my blood glucose levels.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.480]   It even taught me that the sauna
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.960]   that generating a lot of heat in my body
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.920]   was changing my blood glucose levels,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.160]   which turned out to inform
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   how I should shift my eating patterns,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.840]   foods I should eat, timing of eat, and so on and so forth.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   Really gave me great insight
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.460]   into how all the important aspects of my health
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.240]   were interlocking and affecting one another,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.360]   not just how food was impacting my blood glucose.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.200]   So if you're interested in learning more about levels
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.840]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.080]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.460]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.620]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.420]   a few months ago, and it is simply incredible.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.200]   In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.700]   because they don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.460]   in hotels and Airbnbs.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.340]   One of the reasons I love
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.340]   my Eight Sleep mattress cover so much
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.760]   is that, as you may have heard before on this podcast
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.800]   or elsewhere, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.320]   you need your body temperature to drop
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.940]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.940]   And I tend to run warm at night,
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.040]   which makes it hard to sleep
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.680]   When you sleep on an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.300]   you can program the temperature of that mattress cover
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.520]   for specific times in the early, middle,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.960]   and late part of your night
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.640]   so that the mattress stays cool.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.320]   And as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.000]   It also tracks your sleep.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.320]   So it's paying attention to how many times you're moving,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.580]   how deep your sleep is, it gives you a sleep score,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.760]   all wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.180]   And of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.740]   physical health, and performance,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.460]   which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool for enhancing
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.520]   not just your sleep, but all aspects of your life, really.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.320]   If you're interested in trying the Eight Sleep mattress
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.100]   cover, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.580]   to check out the pod three cover,
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.980]   and you can save $150 at checkout.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.620]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, to Canada, the UK,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.860]   and select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.300]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.560]   to save $150 at checkout.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.940]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.580]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.220]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.940]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.620]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.940]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.060]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.740]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.300]   One problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.220]   however, is you get data back
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.280]   about levels of metabolic factors,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.900]   levels of hormones, et cetera,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.780]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.460]   Inside Tracker makes interpreting your data
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.700]   and knowing what to do about it exceedingly easy.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.820]   They have a personalized platform where you can go
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.500]   and you can see those levels of hormones,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.380]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.740]   and they point to specific nutritional tools,
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.760]   behavioral tools, supplement-based tools, et cetera,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.980]   that are optimal for you.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.400]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.300]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.120]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.360]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.500]   The Huberman Lab podcast
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.340]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.660]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.880]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.500]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.060]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.900]   And I should just mention
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.640]   that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.820]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.760]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Eddie Chang.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.700]   Eddie, welcome.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.200]   - Hi, hi, Andrew.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.620]   - Great to be here with you.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.220]   This has been a long time coming.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.580]   Just to come clean,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.660]   we've known each other since we were nine years old.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.480]   - Yeah.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.500]   - But then there was a long gap
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.800]   in which we didn't talk to one another.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.060]   I heard things about you
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.120]   and presumably you heard a thing or two about me,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.460]   for better or for worse.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.700]   And then we reconnected years later
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.660]   when I was a PhD student and you were a medical student.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.360]   We literally ran into each other
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   in the halls of University of California, San Francisco,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.780]   where you're now the chair of neurosurgery.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.540]   So it all comes full circle.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.780]   When you were at UCSF,
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.820]   you were working with Mike Merzenich.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.420]   And I know that name might not be familiar
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.260]   to a lot of people,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.280]   but he's sort of synonymous with neuroplasticity,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.840]   the ability of the brain and nervous system
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.940]   to change in response to experience.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.800]   So for our listeners,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   I would just love for you to give a brief overview
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.160]   of what you were doing at that time,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.980]   because I find that work so fascinating
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.080]   and it really points to some of the things
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.460]   that can promote and maybe hinder
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.980]   our brain's ability to change.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.600]   - Oh, wow, that's fantastic.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.580]   So we did bump into each other serendipitously back then.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.300]   And at the time I was a medical student at UCSF
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.660]   studying with Mike Merzenich.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.660]   In particular, I was studying how the brain organizes
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.060]   when you have patterns of sound.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.740]   And in particular, we were studying the brain of rodents
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.720]   and trying to understand how different sound patterns
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.060]   organize the frequency representation
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.000]   from low to middle to high frequency maps
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.200]   in the brains of baby rodents.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.000]   And one of the things that I was very interested in
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.460]   was trying to understand how the patterns
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.460]   of the natural environment,
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.900]   let's say the vocalizations of the environment
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.920]   that the rat pups were raised in,
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.760]   or just the natural sounds that they hear,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.580]   how that shapes the structure of the brain.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.800]   And one of the things we did was to try and experiment
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.020]   where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.140]   continuous white noise that was essentially masking
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.620]   all of those environmental sounds.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.620]   - And what was the consequence of animals
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.760]   being raised in white noise environment?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.620]   - Well, one of the things that we didn't expect,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.620]   but we found, which is quite striking,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.620]   is that there's this early period in brain development
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.740]   where we're very susceptible to the patterns
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.380]   that we hear or see.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.660]   In neuroscience, we call this a critical period
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.780]   or a sensitive period.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.220]   And we have this for our eyes,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.020]   but we also have it for our ears.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.620]   And one of the most striking examples of this
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.240]   is that any human can essentially grow up in a culture
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.200]   where they hear different speech sounds
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.740]   from one language to another.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.800]   And it's like after a couple of years,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.460]   you lose sensitivity to sounds that are not part
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.420]   of your native language and you have high sensitivity
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.040]   for the languages of your native culture.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.980]   And that's pretty extraordinary
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.900]   that human brain has that flexibility,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.260]   yet at the same time has that specialization for language.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.340]   And so we were trying to think about how do we model this,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.460]   for example, in rodents who obviously don't speak,
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.660]   but we're just understanding how sounds
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.660]   and environmental sounds modulate
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.160]   and organize the auditory cortex.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.780]   And one of the things that we found that was quite striking
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   was that if you basically mask environmental sounds
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.600]   from these rat pups, the critical period,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.780]   this sensitive period where it's open to plasticity,
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.080]   it's open to change, it's open to reorganization,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.100]   that actually, that window can stay open much, much longer.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.380]   And in one way, it sounds like that's a good thing,
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.200]   but on the other hand, it's also a retardation.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.460]   It's actually, it slowed the maturation
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.060]   of the auditory cortex.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.000]   It was ready to close when these rat pups were really young,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.700]   but by raising them in white noise,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.140]   we found out that you could keep it open for months
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.220]   beyond the time period that it normally closes.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.460]   And so I think one of the things it taught me
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.560]   was that it's not just about the genetic programming
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.320]   that specifies some of this sensitive period,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.840]   but it's also a little bit about the nature
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.940]   of the sounds that we hear that help keep that window
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.420]   for the critical period open and closed.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.260]   - It's fascinating.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.440]   And I know it's difficult to make a direct leap
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.200]   from animal research to human research,
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.620]   but if we could speculate a little bit,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.480]   I can imagine that some people grow up in homes
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.580]   where there's a lot of shouting and a lot of inflection.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.300]   Maybe people are very verbose.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.180]   Maybe others grow up in a home
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.900]   where it's quieter and more peaceful.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.860]   Some people are going to grow up in cities.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.960]   I just came back from New York City.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.500]   It's like all night long, there's honking and sirens,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.260]   and it's just nonstop.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.920]   And then I return here where it's quite quiet at night.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.020]   Can we imagine that the human brain
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.240]   is going to be shaped differently
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.380]   depending on whether or not one grows up
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.480]   in one environment or another,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   and would that impact their tendency to speak
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.760]   in a certain way as well as hear in a certain way?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.120]   What do we know about that?
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.540]   Well, I think that it's, from my perspective,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.360]   it's really clear that those sounds that we are exposed to
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.700]   from the very earliest time, even in utero in the womb,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.400]   where the sound is hearing the mother or father or friends
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.240]   while in the womb,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.300]   actually will influence how these things organize.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.320]   So there's no question that the sounds that we hear
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.580]   are going to have some influence,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.120]   and those sounds are going to structure
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.820]   the way that those neural networks actually lay down
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.140]   and will forever influence how you hear sounds.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.920]   And speech and language is probably
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.840]   one of the most profound examples of that.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.760]   - I get a lot of questions
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.800]   about the use of white noise during sleep.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.200]   In particular, people want to know
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.500]   whether or not using a white noise machine
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.560]   or a machine or a program
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.580]   that makes the sound of waves, for instance,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.320]   if it assists their infant in sleeping,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.780]   is it going to be bad for them
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.860]   because it's flooding the auditory system
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.900]   with a bunch of essentially white noise
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.320]   or disorganized noise?
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.760]   Do we have an answer to that question?
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.600]   - Not yet.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.780]   I think that what you're asking is a really important
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.760]   question because parents are using white noise generators
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.960]   almost universally now, and for good reasons.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.400]   It is hard to have kids up at night.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   I've got three kids of my own
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.720]   and was very tempted to think about
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   how to use some of these tools
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.860]   to just soothe them and get them to bed,
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.720]   especially when I was so tired and exhausted.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.440]   But I think that there is a cost
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.600]   to think a little bit about.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.440]   We're not exposed to continuous white noise naturally.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.880]   There is a value to having really salient, structured sounds
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.280]   that are part of our natural environment
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.840]   to actually have the brain develop normally.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.960]   So whether or not that has an impact
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.160]   while you're sleeping, it's not clear.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.400]   I don't think that those studies have been done.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.480]   What was really clear was that
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.300]   if you raise these baby rats in continuous white noise,
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.080]   not super loud, but just enough to mask
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.200]   the environmental sounds, that that was enough
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.560]   to keep the auditory cortex, the part of the brain
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.640]   that hears in this really delayed state,
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.440]   which could essentially slow down the development
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.480]   and maturation of the brain.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.180]   - And one probably assumed that slowing the maturation
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.440]   of areas of the brain they're responsible for hearing
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.180]   might underscore might impact one's ability to speak, right?
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.740]   Because isn't it the case that if people can't hear,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.200]   they actually have a harder time enunciating
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.800]   in a particular way.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.640]   Is that right?
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.080]   If I were to not be able to hear my own voice,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.900]   would my speech patterns change?
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.880]   - Well, I think part of it is that over time,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.520]   we develop sensitivity to the very specific speech sounds
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.360]   in a given language, and the sensitivity improves
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.800]   as we hear more and more and more of it.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.260]   And then on the other hand, we lose sensitivity
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.680]   to other speech sounds at the same time.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   But as part of that process, we also have a selectivity,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.960]   again, a specialization even for those sounds,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.640]   even relative to noise, noisy backgrounds and things like
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.720]   that, I tend to think about it like what is the signal
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.560]   to noise ratio?
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.160]   And so the brain has its own ways of trying to increase
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.680]   that signal to noise ratio in order to make it more clear.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.800]   Part of that is how we hear and how it lays down
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.180]   a foundation for that signal to noise ratio.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.180]   And so you can imagine a child that's raised continuously
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.240]   in white noise would be really deprived of those kinds
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.840]   of sounds that are really necessary for it
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.480]   to develop properly.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.120]   So I think with regard to those tools for babies,
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.560]   I think we should study, we should try to understand
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.400]   this definitively.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.120]   I think what we saw, rodents would tell us
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.880]   that there is potential, things that we should be concerned
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.960]   about, but again, it's not really clear if you're just using
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.660]   at night whether it has those effects.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.740]   - Yes, the critical question that a number of people
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.900]   are going to be asking is did you decide to use
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.420]   a white noise machine or not to help keep your,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.940]   any of your three children asleep?
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.620]   - Well, I think the short answer is no.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.980]   I mean, I obviously did a lot of work thinking
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.580]   and work on this and thought about it carefully,
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.580]   but there are other kinds of noise or I wouldn't even call
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.840]   it noise, other sounds that you can use that can be equally
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.880]   soothing to a baby.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.080]   It's just that white noise has no structure
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.380]   and what it's doing is essentially masking out all
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.400]   of the natural sounds and I think the goal should really
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.500]   be about how do we replace that with other more natural
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.720]   sounds that structure the brain in the way that we want
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.680]   to be more healthy.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.040]   - Well, I know that after you finished your medical
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   training, you went on to, or specialized in neurosurgery
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.320]   and last I checked, you spend your most of your days
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.140]   either running your laboratory or in the clinic
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.580]   or running the department and your clinical work
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.100]   and your laboratory work involves often removing pieces
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.260]   of the skull of humans and going in and either removing
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.260]   things or stimulating neurons, treating various ailments
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.260]   of different kinds, but your main focus these days
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.900]   of course is the neurobiology of speech and language.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.740]   And so for those that aren't familiar, could you please
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.080]   distinguish for us speech versus language in terms
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.620]   of whether or not different brain areas control them
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.980]   and I know that there's a lot of interest in how speech
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.140]   and language and hearing all relate to one another
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.060]   and then we'll talk a bit about for instance, emotions
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.460]   and how facial expressions could play into this
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.460]   or hand gestures, et cetera, but for the uninformed person
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.460]   and for me to be quite direct, what are the brain areas
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.240]   that control speech and language?
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.060]   What are they really, and especially in humans,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.900]   how are they different?
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.720]   I mean, we have such a sophisticated language compared
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.400]   to a number of other species.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.660]   What does all this landscape look like in there?
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.620]   - Yeah, well, that's a fascinating question
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.580]   and I'm going to just try to connect a couple of the dots
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.700]   here, which is that in that earlier work during medical
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.700]   school, I was doing a lot of what we call neurophysiology,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.860]   putting electrodes into the auditory cortex
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.380]   and understanding how the brain responds to sounds
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.940]   and that's how we actually mapped out these things
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.200]   about the sensitivity to sensitive periods.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.380]   That experience with Mike Merzenich and thinking about
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.420]   how plasticity is regulating the brain in particular
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.900]   about how sound is represented by brain activity
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.700]   was something that was really formative for me
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.300]   and because I was a medical student, I was going back
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.620]   to my medical studies.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:38.840]   It was that in combination with seeing some awake brain
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.020]   surgeries that our department is really well known for.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.540]   One of my mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.080]   these methods for taking care of patients with brain tumor
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.920]   and be able to do these surgeries safely by keeping
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.420]   patients awake and by mapping out language.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.860]   - So they're talking and listening and you're essentially
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.980]   in conversation with these patients while there's
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.540]   a portion of their skull removed and you are stimulating
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.740]   or in some cases removing areas of their brain,
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.580]   is that right?
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.380]   - That's exactly right and the only thing off there
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.080]   is it's not essentially, it is just that.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.860]   The only difference between the conversation that I might
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.100]   have with my patient who's undergoing awake brain surgery
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.060]   is that I can't see their face and they can't see my face.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.580]   We actually have a sterile drape that actually separates
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.760]   the operating field and they're looking and interacting
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   with our neuropsychologist, but I can talk to them
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.780]   and they can hear my voice and vice versa.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.100]   And it's a really, really important way of how we can
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.080]   protect some of those areas that are really critical
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.580]   for language at the same time accomplish the mission
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.620]   of getting the seizures under control or getting
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.900]   a brain tumor removed.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.740]   - And is that because occasionally you'll encounter
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.140]   a brain area, maybe you're stimulating or considering
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.900]   removing that brain area and suddenly the patient
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.340]   will start stuttering or will have a hard time
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.500]   formulating a sentence?
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.640]   Is that essentially what you're looking for?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.700]   You're looking for regions in which it is okay
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.500]   or not okay to probe?
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.180]   - Exactly, so the first thing that we do is that we use
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.940]   a small electrical stimulator to probe different parts
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.080]   of the areas that we think might be related and important
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.860]   for language or talking or even movements of your arm
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.420]   and leg, that's what we call brain mapping.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.180]   And we use a small electrical current that's delivered
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.380]   through a probe that we can just put at each spot.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.020]   And the areas that we're really interested in are,
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.860]   of course, the areas that are right around the part
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.300]   that is pathological, the part that's injured
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.300]   or the part that has a brain tumor that we want to remove.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.340]   So we can apply that probe and transiently,
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.960]   meaning temporarily, activate it.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.420]   So if you're stimulating the part of the brain
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.060]   that controls the hand, the hand will move.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.700]   It will jerk, sometimes a fist will be made,
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.380]   something like that.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.360]   Other times, while someone is counting or just saying
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.500]   the days of the week, you can stimulate in a different area
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.140]   that stops their speech altogether.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.300]   That's what we call speech arrest.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.260]   Or if someone is looking at pictures and they're describing
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.580]   the pictures and you stimulate a particular area,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.220]   they stop speaking or the words start coming out slurred
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.380]   or they can't remember the name of the object
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.700]   that they're seeing in the picture.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.540]   These are all things that we're listening really carefully
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.100]   while we apply that focal stimulation.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.780]   That's what we call brain mapping.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.920]   - What are some of the more surprising,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.200]   or maybe even if you want to offer
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.560]   one of the more outrageous examples of things
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.920]   that people have suddenly done or failed to be able to do
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.320]   as a consequence of this brain mapping?
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.900]   - Well, I think the thing to me that has been
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.240]   the most striking is that, you know,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.220]   some of these areas you stimulate and altogether,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.020]   you can shut down someone's talking.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.020]   So person says, "I wanted to say it,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.080]   but I couldn't get the words out."
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.680]   And even though I've seen this thousands of times now,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.880]   it's still exciting every time that I see it
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   because it's exciting because you're seeing the brain.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.720]   It's a physical organ, it's part of the body.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.700]   Outside of the veins, on top of it,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.460]   doesn't look like a machine.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.880]   But when you do something like that
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.320]   and you've vocally changed the way it works,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.400]   and you see that because a person can't talk anymore,
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.300]   and they say, "I know what I want to say,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.000]   but I couldn't get the words out,"
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.460]   you're confronted with this idea that that organ
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.160]   is the basis of speech and language,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.040]   and way beyond that, obviously,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.220]   for all the other functions that we have for thinking
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.580]   and feeling our emotions, everything.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.200]   So that, to me, is a constant reminder
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.420]   of this really special thing that the brain does,
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.740]   was compute so many of the things that we do.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.120]   And in particular, in the area around speech and language,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.760]   generating words, something that is really unique
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   to our species, is just extraordinary to see.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.800]   Again, even though I've seen it thousands of times,
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.880]   it's just having that connection
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.320]   because it doesn't look like machine,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.940]   but it is doing something that is quite complicated,
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.600]   precise, and remarkable.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.200]   - Do you ever see emotional responses
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.280]   from stimulation in particular areas?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.020]   And do you ever hear or see emotional responses
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.720]   that are associated with particular types of speech?
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.700]   Because for instance, curse words are known to,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.960]   people with Tourette's often will curse, not always,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.260]   but sometimes they left texts or other things.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.600]   But what I learned from a colleague of ours
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.120]   is that curse words have a certain structure to them.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.520]   There's usually a heavy or kind of a sharp consonant
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.760]   up front that allows people,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.000]   at least as it was described to me,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.420]   to have some sort of emotional release.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.240]   It's not a word like murmur,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.880]   which it has a kind of a soft entry.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.960]   Here, I'm not using the technical language.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.160]   And you pick your favorite curse word out there, folks.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.140]   I'm not going to shout out any now or say any now.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.300]   But that certain words have a structure to them
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.920]   that because of the motor patterns
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.260]   that are involved in saying that word,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.640]   you could imagine has an emotional response unto itself.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.760]   So when stimulating
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.320]   or when blocking these different brain areas,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.960]   do you ever see people get angry or sad or happy
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.860]   or more relaxed?
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.860]   - Oh, well, definitely I've seen cases
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.020]   where you can invoke anxiety, stress.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.780]   And I think that there are also areas
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.940]   that you can stimulate.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.120]   You can also evoke the opposite of that,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.840]   sort of like a calm state.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.920]   - I think that brain area is slightly hyperactive in you,
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.840]   or at least more than me.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.140]   In all the years I've known you,
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.220]   you've always been, at least externally, a very calm person.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.220]   I mean, I always find it amusing
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.500]   that you work on speech and language
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.720]   and you have a very calming voice, right?
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.060]   And I'm being really serious.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.680]   I think that there was a huge variation there, right,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.800]   in terms of how people speak and how they accent words.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.900]   So there are areas, for example,
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.800]   the orbital frontal cortex that we showed,
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.080]   that if you stimulate there,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.960]   the orbital frontal cortex is a part of the brain
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.800]   that's above the eyes.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.120]   That's why they call it orbital frontal,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.440]   meaning it's above the eye or the orbit
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.240]   and in the frontal lobe.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.640]   And it's this area right in here.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.740]   It has really complex functions.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.640]   It's really important for learning and memory.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.480]   But one of the things that we observed
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.900]   is when you stimulate there,
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.960]   people tended to have a reduction in their stress.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.440]   And it was very much related to their state of being,
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.660]   meaning that if someone was already kind of feeling normal
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.640]   and you stimulate there, it didn't do much.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.960]   But if someone was in a very anxious state,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.840]   it actually relieved that.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.380]   And then we've seen the corollary of that,
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.720]   which is true too,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.760]   which is that there are other areas like the amygdala
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.160]   or parts of the insula that if you stimulate,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.280]   you can cause an acute temporary anxiety,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.880]   a nervous feeling.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.480]   Or if you stimulate an insula,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.240]   people can have an acute feeling of disgust.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.760]   So, you know, the brain has different functions
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.040]   and these different nodes
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.680]   that help process the way we feel.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.600]   Certainly, I think that to some degree,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.440]   neuropsychiatric conditions reflect an imbalance
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.840]   of the electrical activities in these areas.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.720]   One of the things that was something I will never forget
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   was taking care of a young woman with uncontrolled seizures.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.000]   We call that epilepsy.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.200]   It's a medical condition where someone has
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.620]   uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.640]   Sometimes you can see that as convulsions
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.680]   where people are shaking and lose consciousness.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.080]   There are other kinds of seizures that people can have
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.560]   where they don't lose consciousness,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.040]   but they can have experiences that just come out of nowhere.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.960]   And it's just a result of electrical activity
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.740]   coming from the brain.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.480]   And about six years ago,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.280]   I took care of a young woman who was diagnosed
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.640]   psychiatrically with anxiety disorder for several years.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.040]   It turns out that it wasn't really an anxiety disorder.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.960]   It was actually that she had underlying seizures
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.060]   and epilepsy activating a part of her brain
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.780]   that evokes anxious feelings.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.400]   - How was that discovered?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.220]   Because I know a lot of people out there have anxiety.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.560]   I mean, in the absence of a brain scan,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.880]   or why would one suspect that maybe they have a tumor
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.900]   or some other condition that was causing those neurons
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.740]   to become hyperactive?
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.940]   - Yeah, that's really important
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.860]   because so many people have anxiety
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.960]   and the vast, vast majority are not having that
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.120]   because they're having seizures in the brain.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.900]   I think one of the ways that this was diagnosed
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.000]   was that the nature of when she was having
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.860]   these panic attacks was not triggered by anything.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.520]   They would just happen spontaneously.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.500]   And that's what can happen with seizures sometimes.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.280]   They just come out of nowhere.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.680]   We don't fully understand what can trigger them,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.060]   but they weren't things that were
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.320]   typically anxiety-provoking.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.560]   This is something that just happened all of a sudden.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.400]   And because you brought it up,
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.640]   this is not something that you can see on an MRI.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.140]   We could not see and look at the structure of her brain
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.180]   with an MRI that she was having seizures.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.000]   The only way that we could actually prove this
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.600]   was actually putting electrodes into her brain
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   and proving that these attacks that she was having
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.400]   were localized to a part called the amygdala.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.460]   It's a medial part of the temporal lobe, which is here.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.700]   And associating the electrical activity
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.280]   that we were seeing on those electrodes
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.780]   with the symptoms that she had.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.280]   And she ultimately needed a kind of surgery
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   where she was awake in order to remove this safely.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.520]   - Speaking of epilepsy, a number of people out there
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.880]   have epilepsy or know people who do.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.380]   Are the drugs for epilepsy satisfactory?
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.720]   I think about things like Depakote
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.320]   and adjusting the excitation and inhibition of the brain.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.840]   I mean, are there good drugs for epilepsy?
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.640]   We know there are not great drugs
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.800]   for a lot of other conditions.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   But, and how often does one need neurosurgery
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.620]   in order to treat epilepsy
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.520]   or can it be treated most often just using pharmacology?
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.640]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.300]   Well, a lot of people have seizures
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.160]   that can be completely controlled by their medications,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.680]   a lot.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.180]   But there's about a one third of people who have epilepsy,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.560]   which we define as anyone who's had three or more seizures,
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:13.280]   that about a third of them actually don't have control
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.160]   with all of the modern medications that we have nowadays.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.240]   And some of the data suggests that if you have two
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.160]   or three medications, it actually doesn't matter necessarily
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.500]   which of the anti-seizure medications it is,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.160]   but there is data suggests if you've just tried two or three
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.720]   the fourth, fifth, sixth, and beyond
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.980]   is not likely to help control it.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.320]   So we are in a situation, unfortunately,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.560]   where a lot of the medications are great for some people,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.440]   but for another subset, they can't control it
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   and it comes from a particular part of the brain.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.680]   Now, fortunately, in that subset,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.800]   there's another part of that group that can benefit
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.980]   from a surgery that actually either removes
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.340]   that part of the brain,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.620]   and nowadays we'll use stimulators now
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.940]   to sometimes put electrical stimulation
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.340]   in that part of the brain to help reduce the seizures.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.800]   - And you said a third of people with epilepsy
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.300]   might need neurosurgery.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.340]   - Well, what I mean by that is they continue to have seizures
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.520]   that are not controlled by all medications,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.380]   and there's going to be another subset of those
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.760]   that may benefit from a surgery.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.140]   It's probably not that whole third, it's a subset of that.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.840]   It's just to say that epilepsy can be really hard
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.680]   to get fixed, and for people where the seizures come from,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.380]   one spot or an area, then surgery can do great.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.320]   If it comes from multiple areas
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.500]   or if it comes from the whole brain,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.160]   then we have to think about other methods to control it.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.360]   Fortunately, nowadays, there's actually other ways.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.060]   Surgery now to us doesn't just mean
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.560]   we're moving part of the brain.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.160]   Half of what we do now is use the stimulators
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.440]   that modulate the state of the brain
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.140]   that can help reduce the seizures.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.720]   - I've heard before that the ketogenic diet
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.460]   was originally formulated in order to treat epilepsy,
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.400]   and in particular in kids.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.560]   Is that true, and why would being in a ketogenic state
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.640]   with low blood glucose reduce seizures?
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.240]   - That's a great question, and to be honest,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.720]   I don't know actually if it was originally designed
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.080]   to treat seizures, but I can tell you for sure
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.240]   that for some people, just like with some medications,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.560]   it can be a life-changing thing.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.480]   It can completely change the way that the brain works,
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.560]   and it's not something that's for everybody,
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.320]   but for some people, there's no question,
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.640]   and it has some very beneficial effects.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.480]   I think it's to be determined still,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.760]   like why and how that works.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.800]   - I've heard similar things about the ketogenic diet
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.160]   for people with Alzheimer's, dementia,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.580]   that there's nothing particularly relevant
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.840]   about ketosis to Alzheimer's per se,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.960]   but because Alzheimer's changes the way
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.040]   that neurons metabolize energy,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   that shifting to an alternate fuel source
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   can sometimes make people feel better,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.340]   and so a number of people are now trying it,
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.200]   but it's not as if blood glucose and having carbohydrates
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.900]   is causing Alzheimer's, and people get confused often
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.600]   that just because something can help
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.720]   doesn't mean that the opposite is harming somebody.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.560]   So I find this really interesting.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.460]   Sometime I'll check back with you about what's happening
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.300]   in terms of ketogenic diets and epilepsy,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.820]   but you said that in some cases it can help.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.360]   Has that observation been made both for children
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.200]   and for adults?
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.720]   Because I thought that originally the ketogenic diet
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.040]   for epilepsy was really for pediatric epilepsy.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.860]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.440]   So a lot of its focus has really been on kids with epilepsy,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.200]   but certainly it's a safe thing to try,
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.840]   so a lot of adults will try it as well.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.800]   - Interesting.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.320]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.220]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.680]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.040]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.940]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.640]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.840]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.440]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.520]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.640]   once or usually twice a day is that it gets me
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.100]   the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.200]   Our gut is very important.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.760]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.520]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.920]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.560]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.580]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.240]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.080]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.720]   of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.600]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.040]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.520]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.900]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.880]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.200]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.480]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.760]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.180]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.860]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.240]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.320]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.200]   I'm curious about epilepsy for another reason.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.440]   I was taught that epilepsy is an imbalance
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.800]   in the excitation and inhibition in the brain.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.360]   So you think about these electrical storms
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.340]   that give people either grand mal, you know,
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.680]   shaking and kind of convulsions.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.760]   But years ago, I was reading a book,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.160]   a wonderful book, actually,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.520]   called "Einstein in Love" by Dennis Overby.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.400]   It was about Einstein and his more,
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.920]   I guess, his personal life.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.380]   Then people who knew him claimed
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.600]   that he would sometimes walk along
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.840]   and then every once in a while would just stop
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.600]   and kind of stare off into space for anywhere
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.360]   from a minute to three or five minutes.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.720]   And it was speculated that he had absence seizures.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.320]   What is an absence seizure?
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.680]   And the reason I ask is I occasionally will be walking along
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.640]   and I'll be thinking about something and I'll stop.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.240]   But in my mind, I think I'm thinking during that time.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.720]   But I realized that if I were to see myself
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.000]   from the outside, it might appear
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.920]   that I was just kind of absent.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.980]   What is an absence seizure?
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.840]   Because it's so strikingly different
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.600]   in its description from, say, a grand malconvulsive seizure.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.440]   - Sure.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.760]   Well, like I mentioned before,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.040]   depending on how the seizure activity spreads in the brain
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.220]   or how it actually propagates,
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.960]   if it stays in one particular spot
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.640]   and doesn't spread to the entire brain,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.620]   it can have really different manifestation.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.520]   It can represent really differently.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.480]   So, absence seizure is just one category
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.640]   of different kind of seizures
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.760]   where you can lose consciousness
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.240]   basically and what I mean by that
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.920]   is that you're not fully aware
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.880]   of what's going on in your environment.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.000]   Okay, so you're sort of taken offline temporarily
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.160]   from consciousness.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.420]   But you could still be, for example, standing.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.000]   And to people who are not paying attention,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.600]   they may not even be aware that that's happening.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.440]   - What are some other types of seizures?
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.760]   - Well, you know, I think some of the other kinds are,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.920]   the classic ones are temporal lobe seizures.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.360]   So these are ones that come from the medial structures
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.680]   like the amygdala and hippocampus.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.760]   Oftentimes people, when they have seizures coming from that,
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   they may taste something very unusual like a metallic taste
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.400]   or smell something like the smell of burning toast,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.440]   something like that.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.160]   There are some people with temporal lobe seizures
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.320]   will have deja vu.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.600]   They will have that experience
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.680]   that you've been somewhere before.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.840]   But that's just a precursor to the seizure.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.120]   And it just highlights that when people have seizures
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.840]   coming from these areas, they sometimes hijack
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.480]   what that part of the brain is really for.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.680]   So the amygdala and hippocampus, for example,
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.120]   are really important for learning and memory.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   It's not surprising that when people have seizures there
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.720]   that it can invoke a feeling of deja vu
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.800]   or that it can invoke a feeling of anxiety.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:09.340]   And in the areas that are right next to it, for example,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.740]   these areas are really important for processing smell.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.380]   So these areas are right next to each other.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.100]   So you can have these kind of complex set of symptoms,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.920]   the weird taste, the smell of toast,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.260]   and then a feeling of deja vu.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.100]   That's classic for temporal lobe seizure.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.300]   And it's because those parts of the brain that process
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.660]   those functions are right next to each other.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:37.020]   - I'm told that I've had nocturnal seizures
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.900]   and I've woken up sometimes from sleep
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.180]   having felt as if I was having a convulsion,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.260]   the sort of sense of buzzing in the back of the head.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.340]   This happened to me two or three times in college.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.300]   My girlfriend, well, I woke up and my girlfriend
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.700]   was very distraught, like you were having a seizure.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.060]   I was having full convulsion in my sleep.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.620]   What are, is that correct?
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.980]   Is there such a thing as nocturnal seizures?
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.400]   What do they reflect?
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.460]   They eventually stopped happening
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.940]   and I couldn't tether them to any kind of life event.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.460]   I wasn't doing any kind of combat sport
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.440]   or anything at the time.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.220]   I wasn't drinking alcohol much.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.820]   It's never really been my thing.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.000]   What are nocturnal seizures about?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.660]   - Oh, well.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.940]   - And do I need brain surgery?
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.540]   [laughing]
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.620]   - Nocturnal seizures are just another form.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.680]   Like again, epilepsy and seizures
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.200]   can have so many different forms
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.140]   and not just like where in the brain,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.700]   but also when they happen.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.620]   And there are some people who, for whatever reason,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.480]   it's very timed to the circadian rhythm.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.140]   There's actually not just happening at night,
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.480]   but a certain period at night
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.400]   when people are in a certain stage of sleep
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.280]   that the brain is in a state that it's vulnerable
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.820]   to having a seizure.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.020]   And so that's basically just one form of that.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.060]   Again, it's not just about where it's coming from,
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.600]   but also when it's happening and how that's timed
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.380]   with other things that are happening with the body.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.220]   - Interesting.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.440]   Well, it eventually stopped happening,
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.960]   so I stopped worrying about it,
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.160]   but I haven't had seizures since.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.360]   Returning to speech and language.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.720]   When I was getting weaned in neuroscience,
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.320]   I learned that we have an area of the brain
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   for producing speech,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.320]   and we have an area of the brain for comprehending speech.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.020]   What's the story there?
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.340]   Is it still true that we have a Broca's
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.160]   and a Wernicke's area?
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.320]   Those are names of neurologists, presumably,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.180]   or neurosurgeons that discover these different brain areas.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.460]   Maybe you could familiarize us
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.940]   with some of the sort of textbook version
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.020]   of how speech and language are organized in the brain.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.940]   Maybe share with us a little bit of the lesion studies
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.460]   that led to that understanding.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.460]   And then I would love to hear a bit
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.180]   about what your laboratory is discovering
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.620]   about how things are actually organized,
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.740]   because from some discussions you and I have had
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.120]   over the last year or so, it seems like,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.020]   well, let's just be blunt.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.740]   It seems that much of what we know
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.620]   from the textbooks could be wrong.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.860]   - Well, I love that question,
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.020]   because for me, it's very central to the research we do,
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.140]   and it's where the intersection
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.980]   between what we do in the laboratory
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   and our research interfaces with what I see in patients.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.320]   And one of the things that fascinated me early on
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.780]   in my medical training was,
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.340]   in doing some of these brain mapping,
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.940]   or watching them with my mentor,
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.820]   or taking care of patients that had brain tumors
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.740]   in certain part of the brain,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.260]   was that a lot of times what I was seeing in a patient
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.280]   did not correlate with what I was taught in medical school.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.220]   And some people will think,
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.040]   well, this might be an exception.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.100]   But after you see it for a couple of times,
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.780]   and if you're kind of interested in this problem,
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   it poses a serious challenge to what you've learned
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.020]   and how you think about how these things operate.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.780]   And that actually got me really interested
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.640]   in trying to figure this out,
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.060]   because earlier we talked about
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.140]   just this extraordinary thing
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.780]   that the brain is doing to create words and sentences,
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.240]   and that's the process by which I'm getting ideas out
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.900]   from my mind into yours.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.940]   It's an incredible thing, right?
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.080]   It's the basis of communication,
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.020]   high information communication between two individuals
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.180]   that's really unique to humans.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   So in historical times,
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.100]   how this works has been very controversial
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.680]   from day one of neuroscience.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:45.060]   Long time ago, people thought the bumps on your head
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.400]   corresponded to the different faculties of the mind.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.380]   So for example, if you had a bump here,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.080]   it might be corresponding to intelligence
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.820]   or another one over here to vision and these kind of things.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.080]   That's what we nowadays call phrenology.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   And that was kind of the starting point.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.220]   A lot of that has been, of course, debunked,
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.860]   but when you see those little statues
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.600]   of different brain partitions on someone's head,
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.940]   that's essentially how people were thinking
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.040]   about how the brain worked back then a couple hundred years ago.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.300]   Modern neuroscience began when,
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.780]   actually was very much related to the discovery of language.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.340]   So modern neuroscience, meaning moving beyond this idea
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.540]   that the bumps on the scalp corresponded
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.140]   to the faculties of the mind,
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.420]   but there were things that actually
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.860]   were in the brain themselves,
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.580]   and they weren't corresponding to things
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.620]   that you could see superficially,
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.240]   like on the scalp or externally,
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.340]   that it was something about the brain itself.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.020]   I mean, it seems so obvious now,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   but back then, this was the big academic debate.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.080]   And the first observation that I think really
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.020]   was really impactful in the area of language
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.940]   was an observation by a neurosurgeon,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.000]   a French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And what he observed was that in a patient,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.120]   not that he did surgery,
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.380]   but that he had seen and taken care of,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.780]   that the person couldn't talk.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.180]   And in particular, they called this individual tan,
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.180]   because the only words that he could produce was tan, tan.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.740]   For the most part, he could generally understand
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.980]   the kind of things that people were asking him about,
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.380]   but the only thing that he could utter from his mouth
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.840]   were these words, tan, tan.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.380]   And what eventually had happened
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.420]   was this individual passed away.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.100]   And the way that neuroscience was done back then
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.860]   was basically to wait until that happened,
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.140]   and then to remove the brain,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.260]   and to see what part of the brain was affected
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.580]   in this patient that they called tan.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.440]   And what Broca found was that there was a part
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.240]   in the left frontal lobe.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.780]   So the frontal lobe is this area like I described earlier,
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.940]   which is behind our forehead up here.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.940]   And in the back of that frontal lobe,
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.780]   he claimed that this was the seat of articulation
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:21.860]   in the brain.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.620]   He literally used something like that in France,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.380]   the seat of articulation,
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.100]   meaning that this is the part of the brain
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.620]   that is responsible for us to generate words.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:36.780]   About 50 years later, the story becomes more complicated
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.720]   with a German neurologist named Karl Wernicke.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:46.040]   And what Wernicke described was a different set of symptoms
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.840]   in patients that he observed, a different phenomenon,
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   where people could produce words, but a lot of the words,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.460]   and they were fluent in the sense that they had like,
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.520]   they sound like they could be real words,
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.400]   but from a different language, for example.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.000]   And some of us call that like word salad or jargon.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.100]   It's essentially, they were essentially making up words,
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.180]   but it was not intentional.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.640]   It was just the way that the words came out.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.960]   But in addition to that, he observed that these people
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.900]   also could not understand what was being said to them.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.800]   So we could be having a conversation
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   and I'd be asking you, am I a woman?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.480]   And you might nod your head, you know,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.560]   just because you're not processing the question, you know.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   And so here are two observations.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.640]   One is that the frontal lobe is important
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.120]   for articulating speech, creating the words
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.160]   and expressing them fluently.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.720]   And then a different part of the brain
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.120]   called the left temporal lobe,
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.960]   which is this area right above my ear.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:03.280]   That is an area that I think was claimed
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.980]   to be really important for understanding.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.000]   So the two major functions in language,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.300]   to speak and to understand, were kind of pinned down to that.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.300]   And we've had that basic idea in the textbooks
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.560]   for, you know, over 200 years.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.000]   - Certainly what I was taught.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.840]   - Is that right?
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.780]   - Oh, every, yeah.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.880]   And certainly what we still teach undergraduates,
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.240]   graduate students and medical students that.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.520]   - Well, that's what I learned too in medical school.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.820]   And what I saw in reality,
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.240]   when I started taking care of patients,
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.200]   was that it's not so simple.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.800]   In fact, part of it is fundamentally wrong.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.940]   So just in a nutshell, nowadays,
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.200]   after looking at this very carefully
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.460]   over hundreds of patients,
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.480]   we've shown that surgeries, for example,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.840]   in the posterior part of the frontal lobe,
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.020]   a lot of times people have no problem
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.880]   talking at all whatsoever after those kinds of surgeries.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.440]   And that it's a different part of the brain,
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.280]   what we call the precentral gyrus.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.900]   The precentral gyrus is a part of the brain
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.040]   that is intimately associated with the motor cortex.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.560]   The motor cortex is the part of the brain
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.720]   that has a map of your entire body.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.340]   So it has a part that corresponds to your feet,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.520]   it has a part that corresponds to your hands.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.040]   But then there's another part that comes out more laterally
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.080]   on the side of the brain that corresponds to your lips,
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.520]   your jaw, your larynx.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   And we have seen that when patients have surgeries
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.560]   or injuries to that part of the brain,
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.440]   it actually can really interrupt language.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.400]   So it's not as simple as just moving the muscles
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.280]   of the vocal tract, but it's also important
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.400]   for formulating and expressing words.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   So that's Broca's area that I think the field now recognizes,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.240]   not just because of our work,
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.220]   but many other people that have studied this
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.880]   in stroke and beyond,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.680]   is that the idea that that is the basis of speaking
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   in Broca's area is fundamentally wrong right now.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.080]   And we have to figure out how to correct the textbooks
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.760]   that we kind of understand that
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.240]   so that we can continue to make progress.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.720]   Now, in terms of the other major area
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.560]   that we call Wernicke's area, the posterior temporal lobe,
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.840]   that has held,
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.720]   held I think quite legitimately for some time.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.240]   So that is an area that you have to be super careful
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.180]   when you do surgery there.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.240]   That's an area where if you have a mistake there
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.160]   and you cause a stroke or you remove too much
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.380]   of the tumor there, you go too far beyond it,
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.640]   then the person can be really, really hurt.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.560]   Like they'll have a condition that we call aphasia
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.960]   where they may not be able to understand words,
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.920]   they may not be able to remember the word
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.120]   that they're trying to say.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.640]   They know what they're trying to say,
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.080]   but they can't remember the precise word
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.560]   that goes with the object that they're trying to think of.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.440]   They may even produce words that I described before,
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.020]   like word salad or very jargony.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.600]   So they might say something like tamirani.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.400]   That's not a real word, but it sounds like it could be.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.200]   And that's just because that part of the brain
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.440]   has some role, not just in understanding what we hear,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.100]   but also actually has a really important role
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.340]   in sending the commands to different parts of the brain
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.720]   to control what we say.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:38.560]   - Not long ago, you and me
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.960]   and my good friend, Rick Rubin,
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   were having a conversation about medicine and science.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.740]   And Rick asked the question,
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.120]   what percentage of what you learned in graduate
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   and/or medical school do you think is correct?
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.840]   And you had a very interesting answer.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.240]   Would you share it with us?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.440]   - I don't know, I don't remember the exact,
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   but I would say that with regard to the brain in particular,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:16.400]   I would say about 50% gets it right and accurate
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.960]   and is helpful.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.160]   But another 50% is just the approximation
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.280]   and oversimplification of what's going on.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.760]   The example that we talked about, language,
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.960]   just an example of that.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.680]   It's just there are things that make it easier to learn
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.540]   and easier to teach and easier to even think about.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.760]   And that's probably why we continue teaching
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.260]   in the way that we do.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.360]   But I think as time goes on,
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.480]   the complexity of reality of how the brain works is,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.540]   well, first of all, we're still trying to figure it out.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.400]   And second of all, it is complex
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.200]   and it's still incomplete story.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.040]   - It's early days.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.560]   And we get into some of the technical advances
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.120]   that are allowing some correction of the errors
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.800]   that the field has made.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.880]   And look, no disrespect to the brain explorers
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.160]   that came before us and the ones that come after us
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.560]   will correct us, right?
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   That's the way the game is played.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.140]   But what I'm hearing is that there are certain truths
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.680]   that people accept and then there's about half
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.920]   of the information that is still open for debate
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.820]   and maybe even for complete revision.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.380]   One thing that I learned about language
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.660]   and the neural circuits underlying language
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.580]   is that it's heavily lateralized,
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.700]   that these structures Broca's and Wernicke's
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.160]   and other structures in the brain responsible for speech
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.880]   and comprehension of speech,
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.640]   sit mainly on one side of the brain,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.020]   but they do not have a mirror representation
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.980]   or another equivalent area
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.080]   on the opposite side of the brain.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   And for those that haven't poked around in a lot of brains,
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.760]   certainly you, Eddie, have done far more of that
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.000]   than I have, but I've done my fair share
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.080]   in non-human species and a little bit in humans,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.560]   almost every structure, almost every structure
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.920]   has a matching structure on the other side of the brain.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.280]   So when we say the hippocampus,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.160]   we really mean two hippocampi,
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.740]   one on each side of the brain.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.600]   But language I was taught is heavily lateralized.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.440]   That is that there's only one.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.580]   So that raises two questions.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.120]   One, is that true?
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.080]   And if it is true,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.500]   then what is the equivalent real estate
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.580]   on the opposite side of the brain doing
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.980]   if it's not doing the same function
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.400]   that the one on the, say, the left side is performing?
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.280]   - Well, that's one of those things that is,
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.300]   again, like mostly true, not 100%.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.140]   And what I mean by that is that it's complicated.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.480]   So for people who are right-handed,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.120]   99% of the time, the language part of the brain
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.720]   is on the left side.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.840]   - And what is the equivalent brain area
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.900]   on the right side doing if it's not doing language?
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.380]   - Well, you know, the thing that's incredible
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.540]   is if you look at the right side
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.620]   and you look at it very carefully,
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.240]   either under an MRI or you actually look at the brain
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.260]   under slides at a microscope,
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.860]   it looks very, very similar.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.880]   It's not identical, but it looks very, very similar.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.880]   All the gyri, which are the bumps on the brain
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.880]   that have the different contours
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.720]   and the valleys that we call sulci,
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.500]   those all look basically the same.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:17.220]   Like there is a mirror anatomy on the left and right side.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.900]   And so it's not been so clear what's so special actually
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:25.140]   about the left side to house language.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.620]   But what we do know,
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.460]   and this is what we use all the time in assessing
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.420]   and figuring out this before surgery,
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.380]   is if you're right-handed, 99% of the time,
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.660]   the language is going to be on the left side of the brain.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.660]   - Is handedness genetic in any way?
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.100]   I mean, when I grew up by a pen or pencil
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.020]   or crayon was placed into my hand, presumably,
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.180]   or I started using it, my father was left-handed
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.220]   and then where he grew up in South America,
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.700]   they forced him to force himself to become right-handed
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.180]   if she used to restrict the movement of his left hand
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.440]   so he was forced to write.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.620]   So, and then you have hook lefties and hook righties.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.720]   I know this is a deep dive
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.640]   and we probably don't want to go
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.480]   into every derivation of this,
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.260]   but so for somebody who's left-handed,
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.540]   naturally just starts writing with the left hand,
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.380]   there's some genetic predisposition to being left-handed?
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.580]   - Absolutely, no question about it.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.580]   Handedness is not entirely, but strongly genetic.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.420]   So there is something about that ties all of this.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.860]   And what does handedness, for example,
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.620]   have to do with where the part of your brain
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.720]   that controls language?
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.740]   Well, it turns out that the parts that control the hand
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.480]   are very close to the areas that really are responsible
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.820]   for the vocal tract, again, part of the motor cortex
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.960]   and part of this brain area called the precentral gyrus.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.520]   And there are some theories that because of their proximity,
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.720]   that these parts of the brain might develop together early
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.580]   in utero and they might have a head start
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.060]   compared to the right side.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.820]   And because they have a head start,
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.880]   that things solidify there.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.920]   This is one theory of why this happens.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.180]   And people who are left-handed,
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.920]   it still turns out that the vast majority of people
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.940]   have language on the left side, but it's not 99%.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.340]   It's more like 70%.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.540]   So if you're left-handed, it's still more likely
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.700]   that the language part of your brain
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.860]   is gonna be on the left side,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.540]   but there's gonna be a greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%,
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:29.480]   where it's either in both hemispheres or on the right side.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.220]   And just to make this a little bit more interesting
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:38.940]   is that when people have strokes on the left side,
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.360]   and if they're lucky enough to recover from those strokes,
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.460]   sometimes that involves reorganization,
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.980]   this term that we call plasticity earlier,
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.800]   where the areas around where the stroke
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.560]   take on that new function in a way
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.000]   that they didn't have before.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.480]   That can certainly happen in the left hemisphere,
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.920]   but there are also instances where the right hemisphere
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.720]   can also start to take on the function of language,
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.580]   when it was once on the left
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.760]   and then transfers to the right.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.180]   So the thing that I think about a lot
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:17.180]   is that the machinery probably exists on both sides,
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:22.460]   but we don't use them together all the time.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:26.300]   In fact, we may strongly bias one side or the other,
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.860]   just like we use our two hands in very, very different ways.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.740]   It's a little bit the same with the brain.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.600]   Well, it's because of what we do with the brain
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.480]   that actually is why we use the hands in different ways.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.180]   And the same thing goes for language,
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.220]   which is, again, the substrates, the organ,
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.320]   the language organ, the part of the brain.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.720]   The process, it probably has very similar machinery
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.520]   on the left side as the right,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.200]   and the right may have the capability to do it,
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.680]   but in real everyday use,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.140]   the brain specializes one of the sides
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:03.000]   in order for us to use it functionally.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.740]   That's a theory.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.080]   - You're bilingual, correct?
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:06.920]   - Yeah.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.200]   - You speak English and Chinese.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.700]   - Yeah.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.100]   - For people that are bilingual
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.240]   and that learn two or more,
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.360]   well, bilingual is two obviously,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.500]   but learn both languages,
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.880]   or let's say more languages from an early time in life,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.800]   do they use the same brain area to generate that language,
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.720]   or perhaps they use the left side to speak English
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.320]   and the right side to speak Chinese?
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.960]   Do we know anything about bilingualism in the brain?
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.680]   - I think we know a lot about bilingualism in the brain.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.520]   The answers are still out there,
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.840]   the final answer is on it,
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.160]   and part of the answer is yes, absolutely,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.960]   we use some parts of the brain.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.580]   Very similarly, we actually have a study in the lab right now
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:49.600]   where we're looking at this,
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.300]   where people who speak one language or another,
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.160]   or bilingual, and we're looking at
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.320]   how the brain activity patterns occur
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.080]   when they're hearing one language versus the other,
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.600]   and what's striking to see actually
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.580]   is how overlapping they really can be,
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.720]   even though the person may have no idea
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.240]   of the language that they're hearing,
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.200]   the English part of the brain is still processing that
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.940]   and maybe trying to interpret it
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.040]   through an English lens, for example.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.380]   So the short answer is that with bilingualism,
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.760]   there are shared circuitry,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.720]   there's this shared machinery in the brain
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.560]   that allows us to process both,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.840]   but it's not identical.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.920]   It's the same part of the brain,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.240]   but what it's doing with the signals
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.360]   can be very, very different,
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.960]   and what I mean by that precisely
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.460]   is not the instantaneous detecting of one sound to the next,
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:51.460]   but the memory of the sequences of those particular sounds
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.380]   that give rise to things like words and meaning.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.420]   That can be highly variable from one individual to the next,
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.340]   and those neurons are very, very sensitive
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.380]   to the sequences of the sounds,
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.540]   even though the sounds themselves
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.880]   might have some overlap between languages.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.120]   - Fascinating.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.140]   Okay, so we've talked about brain areas
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.780]   and a little bit about lateralization.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.060]   I want to get back to the hands
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.000]   and some things related to emotion in a little bit,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.760]   but maybe now we could go into those brain areas
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.060]   and start to ask the question,
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.340]   what exactly is represented or mapped there?
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.880]   And for people who perhaps aren't familiar
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.080]   with brain mapping and representation in receptive fields,
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.020]   perhaps the simplest analogy might be the visual system
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.520]   where I look at your face, I know you, I recognize you,
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.760]   and certainly there are brain areas
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.360]   that are responsible for face recognition,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.940]   but the fact that I know that that's your face,
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.560]   and for those listening, I'm looking into Eddie's face,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.200]   the fact that I know that that's your face at all
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.600]   is because we are well aware
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.740]   that there are cells that represent edges
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.520]   and that represent dark and light,
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.340]   and those all combine in what we call a hierarchical structure
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.220]   they sort of build up from basic elements,
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.460]   as simple as little dots,
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.360]   but then lines and things that move, et cetera,
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.260]   to give a coherent representation of the face.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.640]   When I think about language,
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.460]   I think about words and just talking.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.160]   If I sit down to do a long podcast
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.460]   or I think about asking you a question,
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.880]   I don't even think about the words I want to say very much.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.240]   I mean, I have to think about them a little bit,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.360]   one would hope,
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.560]   but I don't think about individual syllables
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.120]   unless I'm trying to accent something,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.240]   or it's a word that I have a particular difficulty saying,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.840]   where I want to change the cadence, et cetera.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.160]   So what's represented in the neurons,
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.360]   the nerve cells in these areas,
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.000]   are they representing vowels, consonants,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.480]   and how do things like inflection,
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.520]   like I occasionally will poke fun at up-speak,
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.520]   but there's a, I think, a healthy, normal version
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.200]   of up-speak where somebody is asking a question,
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.480]   like for instance, what is that?
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.640]   That's an appropriate use of up-speak,
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.840]   as opposed to saying something that is not a question
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.720]   and putting a lilt at the end of the sentence,
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.140]   then we call that up-speak,
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.880]   which it doesn't fit with what the person is saying.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.900]   So what in the world is contained in these brain areas?
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:15.840]   What is represented to me is perhaps
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.080]   one of the most interesting questions,
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.400]   and I know this lands square in your wheelhouse.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   - Sure, let's get into this, Andrew,
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.280]   because this is one of the most exciting stuff
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.240]   that's happening right now,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.680]   is understanding how the brain processes
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.720]   these exact questions.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.600]   And you asked me earlier,
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.920]   what is the difference between speech and language?
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.760]   Speech corresponds to the communication signal.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.080]   It corresponds to me moving my mouth and my vocal tract
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.800]   to generate words,
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.400]   and your hearing these is an auditory signal.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.240]   Language is something much broader.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.320]   So it refers to what you're extracting
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.680]   from the words that I'm saying.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.840]   We call that pragmatics,
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.460]   and sort of are you getting the gist of what I'm saying?
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.800]   There's another aspect of it that we call semantics.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   Do you understand the meaning
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.240]   of these words and the sentences?
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.860]   There's another part that we call syntax,
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.440]   which refers to how the words are assembled
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.040]   in a grammatical form.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.100]   So those are all really critical parts of language,
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.280]   and speech is just one form of language.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.080]   There's many other forms like sign language, reading.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.060]   Those are all important modalities for reading.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.580]   Our research really focuses on this area
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   that we're calling speech.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.960]   Again, the production of this audio signal,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.160]   which you can't see, but your microphones are picking up.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.840]   There are these vibrations in the air
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.720]   that are created by my vocal tract,
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.000]   that are picked up by the microphone
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.760]   in the case of this recording,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.020]   but also picked up by the sensors in your ear.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:56.880]   The very tiny vibrations in your ear are picking that up
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   and translating that into electrical activity.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.160]   And what the ear does at the periphery
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   is translates all sounds into different frequencies.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.360]   So its main thing to do is to take a speech signal
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.600]   or any other kind of sound and decompose it,
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   meaning separate that sound into different kind of signals.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.440]   In the case of hearing, what it's doing
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   is separating it out into low, middle, high frequencies
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.580]   at a very, very high resolution.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.040]   It's doing it very quickly,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.320]   and it's doing it in a really fine way
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.720]   to separate all of those different sounds.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.820]   So if you look at the periphery near the nerve
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.640]   that goes to your ear, those nerve fibers,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.440]   some of them are tuned to low frequencies.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.400]   Some of them are tuned to high frequency.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.960]   Some of them are tuned to the middle frequencies.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.700]   And that is what your ear is doing.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.720]   It's taking these words and splitting them up
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.000]   into different frequencies.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.780]   - And for those of you out there that aren't familiar
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.360]   with thinking about things in the so-called frequency space,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.300]   bass tones would be lower frequencies
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.560]   and high pitch tones would be higher frequencies
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.780]   just to make sure everyone's on the same page.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.440]   So the sound of my voice, the sound of your voice
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   or any sound in the environment
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.600]   is being broken down into these frequencies.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.320]   Are they being broken down into very narrow channels
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.480]   of frequency or they, I want to avoid nomenclature here,
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.220]   or are they being binned as fairly broad frequencies?
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.280]   'Cause we know low, medium, and high,
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.200]   but for instance, I can detect whether or not
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.040]   something's approaching me or moving away from me
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   depending on whether or not it sweeps louder
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.080]   or towards or away.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.760]   It's subtle, and of course it's combined with what I see
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   in my own movement, but how finely sliced
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.140]   is our perception of the auditory world?
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.760]   - Oh, extraordinarily precise.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.040]   I mean, we take these millisecond cues,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.640]   the millisecond differences between the sound
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.520]   coming to one ear, let's say your right ear
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.880]   versus your left, to understand what direction
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.080]   that sound came from.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.520]   Those are only millisecond differences.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.040]   And that's how precise this works.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.880]   But on the other hand, it does a lot of computation on this.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.520]   It does a lot of analysis as you go up.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.760]   And a lot of our work is focused on the part of the brain
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.860]   that we call the cortex.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.320]   The cortex is the outermost part of the brain
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.520]   where we believe that sounds are actually converted
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.580]   into words and language.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.360]   So there's this transformation where at the ear,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.400]   words are decomposed and turned
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.760]   into these elemental frequency channels.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.580]   And then as it goes up through the auditory system,
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:53.720]   hits the cortex, there are some things that happen obviously
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.480]   before it gets to the cortex.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.920]   But when it gets to cortex,
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.240]   there's something special going on,
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.860]   which is that that part of the brain
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.260]   is looking for specific sounds.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.800]   And specifically, what I mean by that is the sounds
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.280]   of human language.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.520]   So the ones that are the different consonants and vowels
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.000]   in a different language.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.600]   One of the ways that we have studied this
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.000]   is looking in patients who have epilepsy.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.400]   And in a lot of these cases
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.460]   where the MRI looks completely normal,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.660]   we have to put electrodes surgically on a part of the brain.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.480]   The temporal lobe is a very, very common place.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.760]   So we've done a lot of our work looking at how
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.800]   the temporal lobe processes speech sounds.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.240]   Because we're looking for where the seizures start,
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.400]   but then we're also doing brain mapping
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.040]   for language and speech so we can protect those areas.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   We want to identify the areas that we want to remove
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.460]   to cure someone's seizures,
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.120]   but we also want to figure out the areas
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.860]   that are important for speech and language
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:56.060]   to protect those so that we can do a surgery
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.360]   that's effective and safe.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.380]   And so in our research,
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.560]   and why it's become a really important addition
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.440]   to our knowledge is that we have electrodes directly
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.080]   recording from the human brain surface.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.400]   A lot of technology we work with right now
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.680]   is recording on the order of millimeters.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.120]   And they can record millisecond time resolution
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.000]   of neural activity.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   And what we see is extraordinary patterns of activity
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.800]   when people hear words and sentences.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.840]   If you look at that part of the brain that we call
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.660]   Wernicke's area, in this part of the temporal lobe,
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:42.660]   this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:47.040]   And it's not in a way that is like a general light bulb
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.740]   warming up and it's generally lit up,
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.980]   but what you actually see is something much,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.560]   much more complicated, which is a pattern of activity.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.920]   And what we've done in the last 10 years
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.960]   is to try to understand what does that pattern come from?
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.360]   And if we were to look at each individual site
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.840]   from that part of the brain, what would we see?
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.480]   What parts of words are being coded by electrical activity
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.320]   in those parts of the brain?
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.400]   Remember the cortex is using electrical activity
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.420]   to transmit information and do analysis.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.480]   And what we're doing is we're eavesdropping
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.960]   on this part of the brain as it's processing speech
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.000]   to try to understand what each individual site is doing.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.840]   - And what are those sites doing?
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.220]   Or could you give us some examples
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.160]   of what those sites are doing?
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.960]   So for instance, are they sites that are specific for,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.560]   or we could say even listening for consonants or for vowels
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.660]   or for inflection or for emotionality?
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.800]   What's in there?
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.640]   - Okay, well-
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.680]   - What makes these cells fire?
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.440]   - Yeah, what gets them excited?
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.280]   - Yeah.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.760]   - Where I'm going is hearing speech in particular,
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   there are some of these really focal sites,
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.580]   again, just on the order of millimeter
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.620]   or at some level, single neurons
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:12.240]   that are tuned to consonants, some are tuned to vowels,
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.240]   some are tuned to particular features of consonants.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.240]   What I mean by that are different categories of consonants.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.040]   There's a class of consonants that we call plosive consonants.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.960]   There's a little bit of linguistic jargon,
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.320]   but I'm going to make a point here with that
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.300]   is that certain classes of sounds, when you make them,
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.760]   it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.520]   - Now I'm going to be thinking about this.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.160]   So plosive, like plosives,
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.680]   like saying the word plosive does requires that.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.000]   - Exactly, so what's cool about that
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.480]   is that we actually have no idea what's going on
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.240]   in our mouth when we speak.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.520]   We really have no idea.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.160]   - Some people definitely have no idea.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.400]   [laughing]
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.360]   - Well, not just like in terms of what you're saying
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.780]   sometimes, but actually like how you're actually moving
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.040]   the different parts of vocal track.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.880]   And I have a feeling if we actually required understanding,
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.500]   we would never be able to speak because it's so complex.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.700]   It's such a complex feat.
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.780]   Some people would say it's the most complex motor thing
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.380]   that we do as a species is just speaking,
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:19.880]   not the extreme feats of acrobatics or athleticism,
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.240]   but speaking.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.800]   - Well, and especially when one observes opera
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.520]   or people who, freestyle rappers,
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.800]   and of course it's not just the lips, it's the tongue.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.160]   And you've mentioned two other structures,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.960]   pharynx and larynx are the main ones that,
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.460]   can you tell us, just educate us at a superficial level,
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.600]   what does pharynx and larynx do differentially?
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.440]   'Cause I think most people aren't going to be familiar.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.600]   - Okay, sure.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   So I'll talk primarily about the larynx here for a second,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.360]   which is that if you think about when we're speaking,
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.760]   really what we're doing is we're shaping the breath.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.380]   So even before you get to the larynx,
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.820]   you got to start with the expiration.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:11.080]   So we fill up our lungs and then we push the air out.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.040]   That's a normal part of breathing.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.000]   And what is really amazing about speech and language
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.560]   is that we evolved to take advantage
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.440]   of that normal physiologic thing at a larynx.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   And what the larynx does is that when you're exhaling,
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.800]   it brings the vocal folds together.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.840]   Some people call them vocal cords.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.400]   They're not really cords, they're really vocal folds.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.840]   They're two pieces of tissue that come together
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.640]   and a muscle brings them together.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.520]   And then what happens is when the air comes
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.560]   through the vocal folds, when they're together, they vibrate
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.360]   at really high frequencies, like 100 to 200 hertz.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.940]   Yours is probably about 100 hertz.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.160]   - Whereas yours is 200.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.160]   [laughs]
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.040]   - No, no.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.440]   Most male voices are around 100, okay?
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.680]   And then the average female voice is around 200 hertz.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   - And as you know, I've always had the same voice.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.200]   This was a point of shame when I was a kid.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.600]   Folks, my voice never changed.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.100]   I always had the same voice.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.680]   This is a discussion for another time.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.660]   - Yeah, well, it's a great voice, a great baritone voice.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:15.860]   But I know in your voice, it's a low frequency voice.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.580]   And the reason why men and women generally
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.740]   have different voice qualities is it has to do
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.100]   with the size of the larynx and the shape of it.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.660]   Okay, so in general, men have a larger voice box or larynx.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.340]   And the vibrating frequency, the resonance frequency
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:36.740]   of the vocal folds when the air comes through them
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:40.220]   is about 100 hertz for men and about 200 for women.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.840]   So what happens is, okay, so you're taking,
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.740]   you take a breath in, and then as the air is coming out,
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.420]   the vocal folds come together and the air goes through.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.540]   That creates the sound of the voice that we call voicing.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.820]   And that's the energy of your voice.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.620]   It's not just your voice characteristic.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.020]   It's the energy of your voice.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.880]   It's coming from the larynx there.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.900]   It's a noise.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.980]   And then it's the source of the voice.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.540]   And then what happens is that energy,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.620]   that sound goes up through the parts of the vocal tract,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.780]   like the pharynx, into the oral cavity,
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.820]   which is your mouth and your tongue and your lips.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:30.180]   And what those things are doing is that they're shaping
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:35.180]   the air in particular ways that create consonants and vowels.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.100]   So that's what I mean by shaping the breath.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.060]   It just starts with this exhalation.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.580]   You generate the voice in the larynx,
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.020]   and then everything above the larynx is moving around,
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.280]   just like the way my mouth is doing right now,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.820]   to shape that air into particular patterns
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.980]   that you can hear as words.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.980]   - Fascinating.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:04.980]   And immediately makes me wonder about more primitive
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:11.060]   or non-learned vocalizations like crying or laughter.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:14.700]   Babies will cry, babies will show laughter.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.620]   Are those sorts of vocalizations produced
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.300]   by the language areas like Wernicke's,
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.500]   or do they have their own unique neural structures?
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.940]   - Yeah, interesting question.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.940]   So we call those vocalizations.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:35.020]   A vocalization is basically where someone can create a sound
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:40.020]   like a cry or a moan, that kind of sound.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.820]   And it also involves the exhalation of air.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.180]   It also involves some phonation at the level of larynx
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.180]   where the vocal folds come together
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.960]   to create that audible sound.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.300]   But it turns out that those are actually different areas.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.300]   So people who have injuries in the speech and language areas
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.920]   oftentimes can still moan, they can still vocalize.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.820]   And it is a different part of the brain.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:09.740]   I would say an area that even non-human primates have
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.860]   that can be specialized for vocalization.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.200]   It's a different form of communication than words,
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.660]   for example.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:20.020]   - The intricacy of these circuits in the brain
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   and their connections to the pharynx and larynx is just,
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.500]   it's almost overwhelming in terms of thinking
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.360]   about just how complicated it must be.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.880]   And yet some general features and principles
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.460]   are starting to emerge from your work
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.920]   and from the work of others.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.280]   If we think about that work and we think about,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.760]   for instance, Wernicke's area,
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.240]   if I were to record from neurons in Wernicke's area
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   at different locations,
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.640]   would I find that there's any kind of systematic layout?
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.920]   For instance, in terms of,
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.600]   we've talked about sound frequency,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.320]   we know that low frequencies are represented
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.520]   at one end of a structure and high frequencies at the other.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.160]   This is true, actually, at least from my earlier training
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.700]   within the year itself, within the cochlea,
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.520]   the early work of von Bekasy and from cadavers, right?
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.380]   They actually figured this out from dead people,
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.060]   which is incredible.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.400]   A fascinating literature people should look up.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.840]   And in the visual system, we know that, for instance,
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.640]   you know, visual position where things are
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.320]   is mapped systematically.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.540]   In other words, neurons that sit next to each other
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:28.600]   in the brain represent portions of visual space
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.020]   that are next to each other in the real world.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.900]   What is the organization of language
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.160]   in areas like Wernicke's and Broca's?
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.920]   For instance, I think of the vowels, A, E, I, O, U,
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.000]   as kind of a coherent unit,
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.580]   but do I find the A neurons are next to the E neurons
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.660]   are next to the, or the A, E, I, O, U?
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:55.000]   Is that vowel representation also laid out in order,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.940]   or is it kind of salt and pepper, is it random?
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.620]   - That's been one of the most important questions
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.400]   we've been trying to answer for the past decade.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.000]   So there is a part of the brain
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.240]   that we call the primary auditory cortex,
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.400]   and the primary auditory cortex is deep in the temporal lobe.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.200]   And if you looked at that part of the brain,
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.360]   there is a map of different sound frequencies.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.680]   So if you look at the front of that primary auditory cortex,
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.440]   you'll find low frequency sounds.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.320]   And then as you march backwards in that cortex,
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.980]   it goes from low to medium to high frequencies.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.800]   It's organized in this really nice and orderly way.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.580]   And it turns out there's just not just one,
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:40.900]   there's like mirrors of that tone frequency map
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.640]   in the primary auditory cortex.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.800]   The areas that are really important for speech
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.540]   are on the side of that.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.860]   And we now think that speech
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.900]   can go straight to the speech cortex
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.320]   without having to go through the primary auditory cortex.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   That it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.660]   that processes speech.
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.900]   And when we've looked at that question about,
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.320]   is there a map?
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.400]   The short answer is yes.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.020]   There is a map, and it is,
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:18.000]   but it is not structured universally across all people
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.120]   in a way that we can clearly see right now.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.680]   It is like a salt and pepper map
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.920]   of the different features in speech.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.640]   So before we talked about these sounds
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.400]   that are called plosives.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.080]   You make a plosive when the mouth
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.040]   or something in the oral cavity closes temporarily.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.440]   And when it opens,
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.160]   that creates that fast plosive sound.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.760]   So when you say dad,
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.680]   or the ball,
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.340]   like the B in ball, that kind of thing,
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.040]   you will notice that your lips actually close.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.300]   And then it's the release of that
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.400]   that creates that particular sounds.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.720]   Okay, so those are the sounds that we call plosives.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.640]   Those are like badaga, pataka.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.960]   Those are a certain class of consonants
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.160]   that we call plosive sounds.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   There's another class of sounds
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.960]   that we call fricatives in linguistics.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   Fricatives are created by turbulence in the air stream
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.560]   as it comes out through the mouth.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.560]   And the way that we make that turbulence
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.480]   is getting the mouth and the lips to close
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.340]   almost until they're completely shut,
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:33.740]   or putting the tongue near the teeth
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.260]   to almost get it completely shut,
[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.300]   but just have a narrow aperture.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.540]   That creates a turbulence in the airflow
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.160]   that we perceive as a high frequency sound.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   So those are the sounds like sha and thuh,
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.800]   those kind of things.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.920]   If you look at the frequencies, they're higher frequencies,
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   and those are created by specific movements
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.180]   that you constrict the airflow to create turbulence.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:22:00.180]   And we hear it as sha, sa, thuh.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.240]   - So if I say that.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.080]   - Exactly.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.200]   - And as opposed to a plosive where I'd say explosive.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.040]   - Right.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.120]   - I mean, now, of course, I'm emphasizing here.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.860]   Well, this explains something and solves a mystery,
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.040]   which is recently I've been fascinated by the work
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   of a physician scientist back East, Dr. Shaina Swan,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.160]   who's done a lot of work on things that are contained
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:25.320]   in pesticides and foods that are changing hormone levels.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.860]   And she refers to phthalates, which is spelled pea.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.100]   So it's both a plosive and a thuh.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.080]   So it's combining the two.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.880]   And it's one of the most difficult words
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.640]   in the English language to pronounce.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.080]   Second only perhaps to the correct pronunciation
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.520]   of ophthalmology.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.920]   So it's a combination of a plosive
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.920]   and one of these thuh sounds.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.540]   And that's probably why it's difficult.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:48.480]   - That's exactly right.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.720]   In fact, we have a term for that.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.240]   That's called a consonant cluster.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.380]   So sometimes syllables will just have one consonant.
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.620]   But when we start stacking certain syllables in a sequence,
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.300]   and there's rules that actually govern which consonants
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:05.900]   can be in a particular sequence for a given language,
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.800]   that makes it more complicated.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.440]   And certain languages have a lot more consonant clusters
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.280]   than others.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.120]   - For instance.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.840]   - So for instance, Russian, for example,
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.700]   has a lot of consonant clusters.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.440]   English has a lot of them.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.220]   There are other languages that have very, very few.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.240]   For example, Hawaiian.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.720]   Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12 to 14
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.600]   different phonemes, 14 different consonants and vowels.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.240]   English, on contrast, has about 40
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.220]   different consonants and vowels.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.800]   So languages have different inventories.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.840]   They can overlap for sure.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.800]   But different languages use different sound elements,
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.560]   combine and recombine those elements
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.240]   to give rise to different words and meanings.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.480]   - Can we say that there's a most complicated language
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.080]   out there or among the most complicated,
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.160]   would it be Russian?
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.500]   - It's definitely high up there.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.480]   English is up there too, actually.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.120]   Yeah, German as well.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.880]   - And in terms of learning multiple languages
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.620]   during development, my understanding is that
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.880]   if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual,
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.480]   best to learn those languages simultaneously
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.320]   during development, ideally before age 12,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.520]   if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.400]   Is that correct or do you want to revise that?
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   - Well, basically, the earlier and the earlier is better,
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.780]   the more intense it is and the more immersive it is.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:29.860]   The longer that you can be exposed to that
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.700]   is really important.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.400]   A lot of people can get exposed to it early
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.480]   and basically lose it.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.720]   Even though it's "during that sensitive period,"
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.160]   unless it's maintained, it can be very easily lost.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.840]   Then I think another aspect of it that's very interesting
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.280]   is some of the social requirements for it too.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.000]   It's pretty clear that you can only go so far
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.640]   just listening to these sounds from a tape recording
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.220]   or something like that.
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.180]   There's something extra about real human interactions
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.320]   that activates the brain's sensitivity
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.480]   to different speech bounds that allows us
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.800]   to become specialized for them for a given language.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.200]   - So returning to what's mapped,
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:13.000]   what the representations are in the brain,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.160]   and I'm starting to get a picture now
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.740]   based on these plosives and these sounds.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.620]   And what I find so interesting and logical about that
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.980]   is it maps to the motor structures
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.840]   and the actual pronunciation of the sounds,
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.240]   not necessarily to the meaning of the individual words.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.620]   Now, of course, it's related to the meaning
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.240]   of the individual words,
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.780]   but it makes good sense to me
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:41.460]   why something as complex as language both to understand
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.820]   and to generate would map to something
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.320]   that is essentially motor in design,
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:50.300]   because as you point out, I have to generate these sounds
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.220]   and I have to hear them generated from others.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:56.860]   However, there's reading and there's writing,
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.760]   and writing is certainly motor.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.180]   Reading involves some motor commands of the eyes
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.380]   and et cetera.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.140]   Where do reading and writing come into this picture?
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.520]   Are they in parallel with,
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.940]   as we would say in neuroscience,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.900]   or are they embedded within the same structures?
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.500]   Are they part of the same series of computations?
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:23.500]   - Yeah, so to address the first part
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.500]   is that we've got this map of these different parts
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.920]   of consonants and vowels,
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.420]   and when we look at how they lay out
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.180]   in this part of the brain that we call word accusary,
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.340]   we've spent a lot of time really just dissecting
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.900]   this millimeter by millimeter.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.780]   The term that you use is very apropos.
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.220]   It's salt and pepper.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.100]   It's not random.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.180]   There is this kind of selectivity
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.940]   to these individual speech sounds,
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:52.080]   and one point I want to make about it is this,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.920]   is that in English, for example,
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.620]   there are about 40 different phonemes.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.500]   Phonemes are just consonants or vowels
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.260]   or individual speech segments,
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.660]   but these articulatory features that you refer to,
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.000]   for example, the characteristic sounds
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.120]   that are generated by specific movements in the mouth,
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.060]   you can more or less reduce that
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.600]   to about 12 different features.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.540]   Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue,
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.560]   the jaw, the lips, the larynx.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.420]   There are about 12 of these movements,
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.900]   and just like you said, Andrew,
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.020]   by themselves, they have no meaning.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:36.480]   They're just movements, but what's incredible about it
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.460]   is that you take these 12 movements
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.980]   and you put them in combinations,
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.940]   and you start putting them in sequence.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:47.840]   We as humans use those 12 set of features
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.780]   to generate all words, and because we can generate
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.900]   nearly an infinite number of words with that code
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.620]   of just 12 features, we have something that generates,
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.620]   essentially, all possible meaning,
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.300]   because that's what we do as humans.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.820]   We generate meanings.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:07.040]   I'm trying to communicate one idea to another,
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.380]   which, to me, is extraordinary.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:11.840]   A parallel would be, for example, DNA.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.500]   There's four base pairs in DNA,
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:18.220]   but with those four base pairs in a specific sequence,
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.220]   can generate an entire code for life.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.320]   In speech, it's the same way.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:25.020]   It's like you've got these fundamental elements
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.540]   that by themselves have no meaning,
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:27.780]   but when you put them together,
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.800]   give rise to every possible meaning.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:36.120]   So with regard to your second point about reading and writing
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.180]   it's a fascinating question.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:43.460]   Speech and language is part of who we are as humans.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:47.220]   That's part of how we evolved,
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:52.220]   and it's hardwired and molded by experience.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.460]   Reading and writing are a human invention.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:01.660]   It's something that was added on
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.700]   to the architecture of the brain.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:07.140]   And because reading and writing are fairly recent
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:10.780]   in human evolution, it's essentially too quick
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.140]   for anything to, like, have a dramatic change
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.580]   in, let's say, a new brain area
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.980]   or some kind of specialization.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.240]   Instead, what happens is that whenever any kind of behavior
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.240]   becomes ultra specialized in any of us or any organism,
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.520]   we can sort of take some areas
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.820]   that are normally involved with vision, for example,
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.800]   and specialize it for the purpose of reading.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.520]   So all of us have a part of our brain
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.680]   in the back of the temporal lobe
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.640]   that interface with the cipital visual cortex
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.980]   that we call a visual word form area.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.480]   There's actually a part of the brain
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.700]   that is very sensitive to seeing words,
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.180]   like either typed or handwritten.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.420]   There's a part of the brain
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.740]   that also is sensitive to seeing things like faces.
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.860]   So these are things that are all conditioned
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.620]   on what's important to survive.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.500]   So reading and writing are an invention,
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.980]   and there are things that have mapped
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:17.020]   to functions that the brain already has.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.780]   And one of the really important things
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.000]   about reading and writing
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.500]   is that when we learn to read and write,
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.280]   especially with the reading part,
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.140]   it maps to the part of the brain
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.380]   that we've been talking about,
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.100]   which is the part that's processing speech sounds.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.040]   So some of us kind of think about it.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.020]   These are two different things.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.160]   One is hearing sounds through your ears.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.140]   The other is reading,
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.260]   where you're actually seeing things through your eyes
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.120]   and then getting into the language system.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.760]   Well, it turns out that the auditory speech cortex
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.680]   is the primal and primitive fundamental area
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.000]   that's really important for speech.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.920]   And what happens with the reading
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.640]   is once it gets through that visual cortex,
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:05.180]   it's going to try to map those reading signals
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.100]   to the part of the brain
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.780]   that's trying to make sense of sounds,
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:12.540]   the sounds of words, what we call phonology.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.220]   Now, why is this important?
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:18.700]   It has a lot of relevance to how we learn to write.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:23.720]   And in some kids with dyslexia,
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.000]   dyslexia is a neurological condition
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.820]   where a child, in some cases an adult,
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:34.620]   has trouble reading, for example.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.260]   And in many of those cases,
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:41.900]   it's because that mapping between how we see the words
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.820]   to the way that the brain processes the sounds
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.140]   is something different.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.340]   It's a little bit different
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.780]   than people who can read really well.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.240]   So when you're reading,
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.060]   a lot of times you're actually activating
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.380]   the part of the brain that is processing
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.860]   the words that you hear.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:04.220]   - What is the current treatment for dyslexia?
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:07.900]   I've heard that it's a deficit
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.220]   in some of the motion processing systems
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.020]   of the visual system.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.360]   People are, their eyes are jumping
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.540]   as opposed to more linear reading across,
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.060]   or I suppose if it were Chinese, it would be...
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.160]   I'm going to presume people are always reading English,
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.260]   or I suppose if it's Hebrew,
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.420]   they're going from the opposite side of the page.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:27.720]   What can be done for dyslexia?
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.060]   And do any of the modern treatments for dyslexia
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:34.760]   involve changing things from the speech side
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.960]   as opposed to just the quote-unquote reading side,
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.300]   given that speech and reading are interconnected?
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.380]   So again, I think in the beginning,
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.140]   people might have thought this was purely
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.180]   a visual abstraction or something
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.700]   really just about the visual system,
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.940]   but there's been more recognition
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.860]   that it could be both, or it could be either,
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.160]   depending on the particular instance.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.900]   It's very clear that there are many kids with dyslexia
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:05.260]   where the problem is a problem of phonological awareness.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.680]   So it can be very hard to detect
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.140]   because they may understand the words that you were saying,
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.060]   but because the brain is so good at pattern recognition,
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.220]   sometimes even if the individual speech sounds
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.760]   are not crystal clear, it can compensate that
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.420]   so that you can have an individual who can hear the words,
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.580]   but not be able to essentially hear them
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.940]   when they're reading those same words.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:33.260]   And so what can happen with that
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.740]   is that you can have this disconnection
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.920]   between what they're seeing and what they need
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.660]   in order to hear it as words and process it as language.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   And so skilled readers usually need that route first.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:51.420]   They've gotta map the vision to the sound
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.460]   in order to get that sort of like foundation.
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.260]   But then over time, the reading has its direct connection
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.140]   to the language parts of the brain,
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:03.180]   and we don't necessarily always need to map to sounds.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.060]   You can basically develop a parallel route.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:10.180]   And we as readers actually use both all the time.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.940]   So for example, if it's a new word
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.620]   that you've never seen before,
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.580]   sometimes you try to like pronounce it in your mind,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   you know, and try to hear what that word is.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.180]   Even though you're not actually saying it,
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.280]   you're trying to just generate
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.180]   what those sounds might be like.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:28.420]   And that's the part where we're kind of relying
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.040]   on how we learned to read in the first place,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.540]   which is mapping those word images
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.340]   to the sounds that go along with them.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.400]   But in other times, if you're a really proficient reader,
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.520]   you're just seeing the words
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.420]   and you can map them directly to meaning
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.980]   without having to go through that process.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.400]   - Yeah, I'm a big fan of listening to audio books.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.360]   And of course I also listen to podcasts quite a lot.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.400]   But I also am a strong believer
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.500]   based on the research that I've seen
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.840]   that reading books, physical books,
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.980]   could be on Kindle, I suppose,
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.300]   but reading a physical book is useful
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:07.740]   for being able to articulate well
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.480]   and structure sentences
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.340]   and build what are essentially paragraphs,
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:12.340]   which is what I'm required to do
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.960]   when I do solo episodes of the podcast.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.420]   I've noticed over the years
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.260]   as text messaging has become more popular
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:26.180]   and there's essentially an erosion of punctuation
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.920]   or the need to have complete sentences.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.420]   And now that's sort of transferred to email as well.
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:34.360]   It's become acceptable to just say,
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.140]   fragmented sentences in email.
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:40.820]   It seems likely that it's starting to impact
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.900]   the way that people speak as well.
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.260]   And I don't think this has anything to do
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.980]   with intelligence or education level,
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:50.240]   but are you aware of any evidence
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.780]   that how we read and what we read
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.660]   and whether or not we consume information
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.260]   purely through reading or mainly through auditory sources,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.680]   does it change the way that we speak?
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.400]   Because after all, Wernicke's and Broca's area
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.220]   and the other auditory and speech production areas
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.080]   are heavily intermeshed.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.620]   And so it would make perfect sense to me
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:15.280]   that what we hear and the patterns of sound
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.440]   that are being communicated to us
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.940]   would also change the way that we speak.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:22.680]   - Yeah, that's a really fascinating point.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:27.340]   There's this idea that there's like this proper way to speak,
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.020]   like that there's the right way, for example.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.660]   What are the appropriate, you know,
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:37.540]   like for example, in school, you're oftentimes told like,
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:40.140]   you should say it like this, not say it like that, you know.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.040]   And every language kind of has that.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:45.200]   It turns out that that's really unnatural.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.380]   Languages and speech in particular change over time.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:54.380]   It evolves, and it can happen very quickly.
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.780]   The things that we call dialects, for example,
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:58.040]   are just different ways of speaking,
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.860]   and someone can just be in one environment
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.280]   and change from one dialect to another,
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.540]   or in some people, it kind of is really fixed.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:11.000]   And there's this idea that, you know, like in school,
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.280]   that we're like told that there's this right way,
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.960]   but in reality, that's not true.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:21.160]   Like language change and speech change is completely normal
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.080]   and happens all the time, and it can be really dramatic.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.280]   Like certain cultures and communities,
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.540]   if they are isolated, they can develop a whole new language,
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:33.300]   a whole new set of words, for example,
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.040]   and new ways and dialects that are independent from people
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.980]   to the point where it's unintelligible even to others.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:45.060]   And so the basic idea is that sound change
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.800]   is part of the way it works,
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.680]   and the brain is very sensitive to those kinds of changes.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.400]   - Speaking of learning new languages,
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.880]   I'm assuming it's possible to learn new languages
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.980]   throughout the lifespan, correct?
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.960]   - Yeah.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.300]   - I've also heard these kind of fantastical stories
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:10.300]   of somebody has a stroke and then suddenly, spontaneously
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.140]   can speak French fluently,
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.880]   whereas prior to the stroke, they could not.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.780]   Is there any merit to those stories whatsoever?
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:20.280]   I find it very hard to believe
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.360]   that there was a complete map representation of a language
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.720]   in somebody's brain that they were completely unaware of,
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.600]   and then because of damage to a brain area,
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.260]   that capacity to speak that language was somehow unveiled.
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.200]   It just seems too wild and I don't want to say good to be
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.000]   true because nobody wants a stroke,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   but it just seems outrageously implausible.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.960]   - Well, there are aspects of that
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.360]   that certainly are implausible.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.440]   So I don't know of any true case that I've ever seen
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.280]   or experienced myself or even read about
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.860]   where, for example, there was an injury to the brain
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.040]   that resulted in loss of,
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.160]   well, essentially a gain of function,
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.920]   meaning like this art of just all of a sudden
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.360]   starts speaking another language.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.620]   So for example, if you had a stroke
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:12.180]   and you never spoke French and then you had it,
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.280]   and then all of a sudden you're speaking,
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.840]   that I've never heard of, never seen.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.720]   However, there is a condition that is well acknowledged,
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.020]   and I have seen one case of this
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.680]   called a foreign accent syndrome,
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.540]   which is peculiar because there are people
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.800]   who have an injury to the part of the brain
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.560]   where it sounds like they're starting
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.080]   to speak this other language,
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:38.040]   but they're not actually speaking the language.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.580]   It just sounds like it.
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:43.600]   And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.400]   about these areas that are really important
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.760]   for speech control of the vocal tract,
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.580]   this area in the precentral gyrus.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:55.640]   People have documented where patients
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:59.080]   have had strokes there, and after that,
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.720]   it sounds like they're speaking Spanish
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.040]   as opposed to English, or it sounds like
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:08.300]   they have the intonational properties of French or Russian
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:11.560]   as compared to their original native language.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.080]   They're not learning all the rest of it,
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.600]   like the meaning and the grammar, et cetera,
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.360]   but they're adopting some of the phonology,
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.800]   and part of that is just because
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.560]   it's not working the way it normally does.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.920]   So there is something actually called
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.320]   a foreign accent syndrome
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.120]   that people can have after a stroke.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.760]   - Interesting.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.720]   I'm curious about auditory memory.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.960]   When I was a kid, I used to get into bed at night
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.020]   and I'd close my eyes and I would replay conversations
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:44.720]   that I'd heard during the day or people's voices.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.000]   I actually can remember calling your house
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.360]   when we were young kids,
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.060]   and because I don't speak any Chinese,
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.400]   but I'd have to ask for you, I'd say,
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.640]   I think it was [speaks in foreign language]
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.700]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:59.240]   And then someone, whoever answered the phone would say,
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.680]   would go get you in there and say, [speaks in foreign language]
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.560]   which I believe means thank you, right?
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.020]   That's the total of the Chinese that I speak, by the way.
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:09.040]   But I will never forget that.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.660]   I'll just never forget it, I hope.
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.780]   I suppose if I have a stroke or something of that sort,
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.700]   at some point I'll forget it
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.060]   and I won't know that I've forgotten it.
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:18.300]   But in all seriousness, I remember that to this day.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.880]   I couldn't spell that out.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.780]   I wouldn't know how, certainly not in Chinese,
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:25.120]   but even a transliteration I couldn't do
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.880]   using English letters.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.860]   Where are memories of sounds stored?
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:38.000]   Because within our days and across our lives,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.720]   we have an infinite number of auditory experiences.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.160]   Just like we have an infinite number of visual experiences.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.980]   Where are they stored
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.760]   and what is the structure of their storage?
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.180]   What am I calling upon?
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:53.340]   Besides, of course, the motor commands
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.980]   that are required to say what I just said in Chinese,
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.020]   which I won't repeat again,
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.580]   'cause somehow I managed to get it right the first time,
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.260]   or at least not terribly wrong,
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.560]   then I don't want to botch it the second time.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.240]   Where is that stored and how does that work?
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.200]   And more importantly, as I speak my native language, English,
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.380]   am I pulling from a memory bank?
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:14.000]   Because it doesn't feel like it.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.080]   I'm just telling you what I want to say.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.820]   I'm doing my best to communicate clearly and succinctly.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.780]   Usually not so good at the succinct part.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:26.980]   But where is the bank of information?
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:30.980]   On my keyboard, on my computer, I have the letters
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.740]   and I have certain elements of punctuation in the space.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.940]   What am I pulling from?
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.620]   Am I pulling from those plosives?
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:42.360]   But if so, how can I do it so quickly?
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.420]   Even for people that speak slowly,
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:47.400]   it appears more or less fluid.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.480]   This to me is overwhelmingly impressive
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.980]   that the brain can do that.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:54.940]   How does it do that?
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:59.520]   - Well, first of all, I am impressed
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.560]   that 35 years later.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.680]   - Well, I had to get ahold of you.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.040]   - Yeah, so I am impressed 35 years later
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.880]   that you can still remember that.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.440]   - But only that.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.280]   - That's fine.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.080]   But I'm still very impressed in,
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.920]   but it clearly was something important to you.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.920]   And so the short answer is that memory is very distributed.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.880]   So it's almost like the question that you asked me
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.940]   is ill-posed.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.880]   'Cause you asked me where.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.040]   Well, it's not one specific area.
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.840]   It's actually really distributed.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.040]   It's not just one particular area.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.000]   In fact, I'm fairly certain that if we were to injure
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.100]   that part of the brain called the wernicke's area,
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:46.420]   you may still even have memories of that.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.880]   People can have injuries of Broca's area
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.840]   or certainly the precentral gyrus
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.960]   and be able to sing "Happy Birthday," for example,
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:58.360]   when it's embedded in melody or highly rehearsed things
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.960]   like counting despite not being able to speak,
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.480]   which is incredible, right?
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.560]   It's like you can see a patient, for example,
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.880]   who can't really put together a sentence.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.140]   You ask them, "How are you feeling today?"
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.440]   They can't even utter a word,
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.160]   but then you ask them to count sometimes
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.320]   and they'll get up to any number, really.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.800]   And so there are some things that are really built
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.440]   into our motor memory and it's distributed.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.520]   It's not one particular part of the brain.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.440]   It's actually multiple areas
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.840]   where that memory is distributed.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.600]   And thank God that's the way it is
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   because it's very rare in the kind of surgeries that I do
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:43.380]   where you go and you remove a part of a piece of the brain
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:47.040]   that someone forgets these kind of long-term memories
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.760]   or these long-term motor skills that they have.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.760]   That's very, very rare.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.660]   It's the number one question a patient will ask me,
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.800]   like, "Am I gonna be the same,
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:01.940]   and am I gonna remember my wife?"
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:06.140]   Or, "Am I gonna remember these thoughts of my birthday
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.480]   when I was 10 years old?"
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.800]   And I've never really seen that kind of severe amnesia
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.820]   unless it's a very, very severe injury
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:17.720]   that involves almost the entire brain.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.460]   And thank God.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:24.020]   So a lot of that information is really distributed
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:26.140]   across the entire brain.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:31.140]   - Speaking of storage of and ability to speak,
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.780]   you are doing some amazing work
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:37.220]   and have achieved some pretty incredible,
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.520]   well-deserved recognition for your work
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.700]   in bringing language out of paralyzed people,
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.340]   essentially allowing people who are locked in
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:50.060]   to a paralyzed state or otherwise unable
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:54.260]   to articulate speech using brain-machine interface,
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:57.320]   essentially translating the neural activity
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.780]   of areas of the brain that would produce speech
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.780]   into hardware, wires, and things of that sort,
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.500]   artificial non-biological tools
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.100]   in order to allow paralyzed people to communicate.
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.180]   We will provide a link
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.860]   to some of the popular press coverage of that work
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:17.840]   in the original papers.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.020]   But if you would be so kind as to tell us
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.780]   what those experiments look like,
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.020]   who these people are who are locked in
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.780]   and that you allow to communicate.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.660]   And then especially interesting to me
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:33.500]   are some of the directions that you're taking this now,
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:37.200]   which is beyond just people being able to think
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.420]   about what they want to say
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.900]   and words coming out on a screen or through a microphone,
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:43.060]   but actually making the interactions
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.340]   between these people in the real world
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:49.300]   more elaborate and more real.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.760]   If that seems mysterious to people,
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.220]   I'm going to let Eddie tell you what they're doing with this
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:56.220]   rather than put any more detail on it.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.060]   - Oh, okay.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.880]   Well, thanks for asking about this.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:01.700]   This has really been some of the exciting,
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:04.080]   recent work from the lab.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.860]   So for the last decade,
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:09.580]   we've really been focusing on the basic science,
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:13.020]   meaning trying to understand how the brain extracts
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:16.900]   and produces speech sounds and words.
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:20.260]   We've done a lot of work trying to figure out
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:21.700]   how these parts of the brain
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:24.340]   control these individual elements
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:27.060]   that give rise to all words and meanings.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:30.900]   And so it was about six years ago
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:35.820]   where we realized we actually have a pretty good idea
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:37.680]   of how this code works.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.060]   We had identified all of these different elements
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.660]   that we could decode in epilepsy patients.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:47.420]   For example, when they had electrodes on the brain
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.220]   as part of their surgeries,
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:51.540]   we could decode all of the different consonants
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:52.660]   and vowels of English.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.640]   That was about six years ago.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.300]   So a natural question was this,
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.980]   which is if we understand that electrical code,
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:05.500]   can we use that to help someone who is paralyzed
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:08.180]   and can't get those signals out of the brain
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.540]   to speak normally?
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.500]   And that's in the setting of people who are paralyzed.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.820]   So there are a series of conditions.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:18.980]   They include things like brainstem stroke.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.920]   The brainstem is the part of the brain
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.860]   that connects the cerebrum, which is the top part,
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:26.300]   does our thinking and a lot of the motor control,
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.300]   speech, language, everything.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.860]   And the brainstem is what connects that to the spinal cord
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:32.920]   and the nerves that go out to the face and vocal tract.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:34.900]   So if you have a stroke there,
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.940]   basically you could be thinking all the wild,
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:39.540]   creative, intelligent thoughts.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.880]   You have in the mind and the cerebrum,
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.640]   but you can't get them out into words.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.420]   Or you can't get them out to your hand to write them down.
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.400]   So that's a very severe form of paralysis
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.420]   called brainstem stroke.
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:54.440]   There's another kind of conditions
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.020]   that we call neurodegenerative,
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.620]   where the nerve cells die, basically,
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:03.640]   or atrophy in a condition called ALS.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.400]   And that's a very severe form of paralysis.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.580]   And it's extreme form, people essentially lose
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:12.180]   all voluntary movement.
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.040]   >> So Stephen Hawking would be a good example
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.060]   of someone with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.600]   >> He's an example of someone who had ALS,
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.060]   but not a great example of what typical course of ALS.
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.500]   So for reasons not clear,
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.420]   the progression of his disease largely stabilized
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:31.020]   to the point where he could twitch, you know,
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.820]   a cheek muscle or move his eyes, let's say.
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:38.060]   In most people, it's very rapid.
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.540]   And many people, they die from it actually,
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:43.800]   you know, within a couple of years of diagnosis.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.360]   >> Yeah, he lived a long time in that.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.300]   >> He lived a long time.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:48.620]   >> That's like slanted overstate in his wheelchair.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:53.300]   >> Exactly, but he wasn't breathing, you know,
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.180]   through a tube in his throat, for example,
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.920]   because people with severe ALS,
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.300]   the muscles to their diaphragm and their lungs
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:02.800]   essentially give out as well.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.260]   They get weakness there and then they can't breathe anymore.
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:08.860]   So that's another form of paralysis.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:12.460]   And so, in our field, these are kind of like
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.760]   the most devastating things that can happen.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.460]   I'm not gonna really try to compare like what's worse,
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.900]   you know, having a brain tumor or stroke, it's all bad.
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.380]   But this condition of what we call being locked in
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:28.920]   refers to this idea that you can have
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.920]   completely intact cognition and awareness,
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.620]   but have no way to express that.
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:40.980]   No voluntary movement, no ability to speak.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.420]   And that is devastating because psychologically
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.140]   and socially, you know, you're completely isolated.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.120]   That's what we call locked in syndrome.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.300]   And it's devastating.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.180]   I've seen that throughout my career.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:55.140]   And it's really heartbreaking because
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:59.940]   you know that the person is there,
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.880]   but you can't see, they can't communicate.
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:07.060]   So, we've been studying this patterning
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.720]   of electrical activity for consonants and vowels.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:13.200]   And essentially once we figured out a lot of these codes
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.760]   for the individual phonetic elements,
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:20.500]   we took a little bit of a detour,
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.320]   or at least part of the lab started to focus
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.660]   on this very specific question.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:27.180]   For people who have these kind of paralysis,
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:32.180]   could we intercept those signals from the brain,
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:35.020]   the cerebral cortex, as someone is trying
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:36.960]   to say those words?
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.800]   And then can we intercept them and then have them
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.860]   taken out of the brain through wires to a computer
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.160]   that are gonna interpret those signals
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.900]   and translate them into words?
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:53.900]   So, about three years ago, we started a clinical trial.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:57.460]   It's called the BRAVO trial, it's still underway.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.680]   And the first participant in the BRAVO trial
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:04.140]   was a man who had been paralyzed for 15 years.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:10.060]   When he was about 20 years old, he came to the United States,
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.720]   was actually working in Sonoma area,
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.700]   and he was in a car accident.
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:18.900]   And he actually walked out of the hospital
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:21.220]   the day after that car accident.
[01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:25.300]   But the next day had a complication related to it
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.660]   where he had a very large stroke in the brain stem.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.960]   And that turned out to be devastating.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:34.900]   He didn't wake up from that stroke for about a week.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.140]   He was in a coma for about a week.
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.840]   And when he woke up from that coma,
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:40.480]   he realized that he couldn't speak
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:42.060]   or move his arms or legs.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:47.760]   And as he told me or communicated to us,
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.240]   that was absolutely devastating.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.360]   He wanted really to die at that time.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:55.180]   - Could he blink his eyes or move his mouth in any way?
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.920]   - He could blink his eyes.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.340]   He had some limited mouth movements,
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.240]   but couldn't produce any intelligible speech.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:04.480]   He was, like, completely slurred and incomprehensible.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.380]   And he survived this injury.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.780]   A lot of people who have that kind of stroke
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:11.500]   just don't survive.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:15.120]   But he survived, and I also realized
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.060]   that he's just an incredible person,
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:20.660]   like a force of nature in terms of his optimism,
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.440]   in terms of his ability to make friends
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.380]   despite his condition.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.680]   The way he actually communicates,
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:28.140]   because he has a little bit of residual neck movements,
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:32.340]   is that he improvised and had his friends
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:37.020]   basically put a stick attached to his baseball cap.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:38.740]   Because he could move his neck,
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:41.380]   he would essentially type out letters
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.900]   on a keyboard screen to get out words.
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.280]   In fact, this is how he communicated,
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:48.260]   was through a device that he would essentially
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.940]   peck out letters one by one by moving his neck
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:54.860]   to control the stick attached to his baseball cap.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.380]   - How many years did he use that method of communication?
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:53:59.700]   - For about 15 years.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:02.180]   He hadn't really spoken for about 15 years.
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.700]   - Oh, goodness. - Yeah.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:06.780]   So it was a devastating injury,
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:11.780]   but there's something to be said about the human spirit.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:14.700]   And if there's anyone who embodies it,
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:17.180]   it is Pancho, that's his nickname,
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.000]   the first participant in our trial.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.620]   He has that human spirit.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:25.380]   He persevered and in fact could thrive in his community,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.700]   basically, and friends, being able to communicate
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.700]   in this very slow and inefficient way.
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.740]   Maybe part of that spirit is why he volunteered
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.060]   to be the first person in this trial.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:39.140]   It was a clinical trial, an experiment.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:39.980]   It was a study.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:42.660]   This is not an approved therapy by any means.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:45.940]   This was really something that had not been done before.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:50.780]   And we had a lot of ideas about it, but we didn't know.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:52.540]   We had proven a lot of this could be true
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:55.020]   in some people who were normally speaking.
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:57.100]   But to actually put it into someone who's paralyzed,
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.440]   number one, where we don't know the code is the same.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.860]   Number two is someone who's not been speaking for 15 years,
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:08.080]   whether those signals are actually still there or not.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:11.540]   So it was part of a clinical trial.
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:15.460]   It was, you know, something that our hospital
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.920]   and also the FDA, you know, had to approve
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.060]   and looked at very carefully.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.180]   But given a lot of the work that we had done,
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.900]   there were some basis for why this might work.
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:28.260]   And so about two and a half years ago,
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:32.300]   we did a surgery where we implanted electrodes
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.000]   onto the parts of the brain that we've been talking about,
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.580]   these areas that control the vocal tract,
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.980]   the areas that control the larynx,
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.180]   the areas that control the lips and tongue and jaw movements
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.220]   when we normally speak.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.060]   These are areas that presumably may be active.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.060]   That was our hope in his brain,
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:50.940]   but he just couldn't get those out
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:54.260]   to control his mouth in a normal way.
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:56.900]   And he underwent a surgery, a brain surgery,
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.340]   where we put an electrode array
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:04.180]   and we connected it to a port that was screwed to his skull.
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:08.240]   And the port actually goes through his scalp.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.740]   And he's lived with this now for the last three years.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:13.300]   It is a risk of infection.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.600]   These ports eventually have to become wireless
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.980]   in the future, but we figured out a way
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:21.280]   to keep that port there where we can essentially
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:24.580]   connect him to a computer through that port.
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:29.200]   So he has an electrode array that's implanted
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.740]   over the part of his brain that's important for speech.
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:34.300]   It's connected to a port.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:38.240]   And then we connect a wire to that port
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.120]   that translates those, what we call analog brainwaves,
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:46.120]   and converts them into digital signals.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.900]   And then a computer takes those digital signals
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:53.400]   from those individual sites from the speech cortex
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.020]   and translates those into words.
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:58.300]   - Can you describe for us the first time
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:03.300]   that Poncho spoke through this engineered device?
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.620]   What was that experience like for you?
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.900]   And at least from what he conveyed to you,
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:10.360]   what was that experience like for him?
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.300]   Is this somebody who was essentially locked in
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:15.320]   except for this rather crude pecking device?
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.560]   Although I'm thoroughly impressed by how adaptive
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.820]   or adaptable Poncho was in his friend's engineering
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.600]   that device for him is really nothing short of clever
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.920]   because otherwise he would be truly locked in, right?
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.840]   But what was that moment like?
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.440]   I can only imagine.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.940]   - That moment was incredible.
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:40.060]   It was truly incredible to be able to see him
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:43.400]   try to get out a word that was,
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:46.280]   for all practical purposes, unintelligible,
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.220]   but to be able to take the brain activity
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:51.400]   and to translate it into text on a screen.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.240]   And that's what we did.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:55.440]   We took those brainwaves, we put them through
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.140]   machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithm
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:01.480]   that can pick up these very, very subtle patterns.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.380]   You can't actually see them with your eye
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:08.000]   in the brain activity and translate those into words.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.920]   And I remember seeing this happening for the first time.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.580]   It doesn't happen like immediately.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:18.960]   This is something that took weeks to train the algorithm
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.420]   to interpret it correctly.
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:26.740]   But what was incredible about it was to see how he reacted.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:31.580]   And he would be prompted to say a given word,
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.260]   like outside, for example.
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:37.760]   And then he would think about it, try to say it,
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:41.020]   and finally those words would appear on the screen.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:44.480]   And what was really amazing about it was
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:48.400]   you could really tell that he got a kick out of that
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.520]   because he would start to giggle.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.960]   His body would shake in a way
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:56.180]   and his head would shake in a way
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:58.180]   that he would start to giggle.
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:00.100]   And that was cool to see.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.380]   But then I also realized that when he was giggling,
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.880]   it kind of screwed up the next word's decoding.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.420]   (laughing)
[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:09.700]   - Is that a bug you've since fixed?
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:10.980]   - No, we haven't fixed that.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:12.300]   - Interesting. - We haven't fixed that.
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:15.100]   So it's easier just to tell him to stop giggling.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.580]   (laughing)
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.800]   - So what was the first word that he said?
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:20.660]   - Well, I think one of the first sentences
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.480]   that he put together was, you know,
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:24.380]   can you get my family outside?
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.820]   - You mean get them out of the room?
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:27.660]   - No, no.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.500]   - All these years, he wanted to get away from his family?
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.580]   - No, I think what he meant was can you get them--
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:32.740]   - Bring them in. - Bring them in.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:36.660]   And so the way this worked was we trained
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.700]   this computer to recognize 50 words.
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.460]   We started with a very small vocabulary
[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:44.260]   that's expanding as we speak.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.300]   I think that this is just a matter of time
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:50.300]   before these vocabularies become much, much larger.
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.620]   But we started with a 50 set of words.
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:56.260]   We created essentially all the possible sentences
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:59.260]   that you could generate from those 50 words.
[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:02.420]   Why that was important was you can use those,
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:04.420]   all those possible sentences to create
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.820]   a computational model, computer model
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.200]   of all the different word combinations
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.940]   to give different sentences, given those 50 words.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:16.540]   And then you can essentially do what we call autocorrect.
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.660]   It's the same kind of thing that we do
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.620]   when you're texting, for example,
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:23.220]   you get the right, the wrong letter in there,
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:26.220]   but your phone actually knows, you know,
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:29.060]   because it's context what corrected.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:32.840]   So because the decoding's not 100% correct all the time,
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:35.980]   in fact, it's far from that, it's really helpful
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.100]   to have these other features like autocorrect,
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.900]   the stuff that we use routinely now with texting
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.700]   that makes it correct and then updates it.
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.860]   So it's a combination of a lot of things.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:47.860]   It's the AI that is translating
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.980]   those brain activity patterns.
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:53.220]   But it's also things that we've learned from speech
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:55.940]   and speech technologies that, you know,
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.780]   you put all together and then all of a sudden
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.400]   it starts to work.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.740]   And so we were really excited
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:04.400]   because that was the first time that someone was paralyzed
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:07.920]   and could create words and sentences
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.480]   that was just decoded from the brain activity.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.360]   - Incredible.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.460]   And I know you're very humble,
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.700]   but I'm going to embarrass you by saying,
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.460]   I always knew you were destined for great things
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.440]   since the early age of nine when we first became friends.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.760]   But when I read that, the news coverage of your work
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.040]   with Poncho and the release of this language
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.460]   from this locked in patient, it literally, you know,
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.460]   it brought tears to my eyes because it's, you know,
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.820]   it's an interesting thing as fellow neuroscientists, right?
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:41.640]   We explore the brain and we try and find mechanisms
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.100]   and we try and compare those to what other people find
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:47.020]   and find truths and principles and build up from those.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:52.020]   But pretty rarely is there a case where that route
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:56.820]   of exploration leads to something of clinical significance
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.500]   within one's own lifetime.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.140]   I mean, that's the reality of science.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:03.260]   And oftentimes it's a very distributed process and,
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.240]   but in this case, it's been a magnificent thing
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:09.400]   to see you move along this trajectory,
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.200]   parsing these language and speech areas,
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.200]   and then to also do the clinical work in parallel.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.380]   Speaking of which, these days,
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:21.560]   we hear a lot about Neuralink, Elon Musk's company,
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.460]   a neurosurgeon that came up briefly through my lab,
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:26.800]   but I can't take any credit for what he knows or does,
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:29.700]   which is Matt McDougall is the neurosurgeon at Neuralink.
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:31.400]   There's some other excellent neuroscientists there
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:32.600]   and engineers there.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:34.400]   We hear a lot about Neuralink because
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.720]   while brain machine interface of the sort that you do
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.860]   and that other laboratories do
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.560]   has been going on for a long time,
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:47.060]   there's been some press around Neuralink
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.400]   about the promise of what brain machine interface could do.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.320]   For instance, early in our discussion,
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:53.500]   you talked about how, you know,
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:55.640]   language is constrained by these sound waves.
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:58.120]   And typically it's a few people communicating
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.360]   or one person with many people
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.600]   through a podcast, for instance, or a speech.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.660]   But the idea has been thrown out there
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:08.520]   that through the use of stimulating chips
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:11.960]   or through other brain machine devising,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:15.120]   that perhaps one could internalize
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.920]   50 conversations in parallel, right?
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.960]   50x communication.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.160]   Or that the memory systems could be augmented
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.800]   to remember 10 times as much information
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.920]   or even twice as much information in a given period of time.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.360]   My understanding of what they're doing at Neuralink,
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.720]   which is admittedly crude and from the outside,
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.240]   few discussions with people there,
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.520]   is that they too are going to pursue clinical goals first.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:43.880]   Things like trying to generate smooth movement
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.460]   in a Parkinsonian patient,
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:49.240]   trying to adjust movement patterns
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.560]   in someone with Huntington's disease, for instance,
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.820]   things of that sort.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.800]   Before they embark on the more sci-fi-like
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:01.840]   explorations of 50x-ing communication
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.360]   or doubling memory capacity and these kinds of things.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:05.440]   Although I don't know, they may be doing
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:07.040]   all of those things in parallel.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.220]   What are your thoughts about super capabilities of the brain
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:16.440]   or I don't even know what word to use.
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:19.400]   Supercharging the brain, giving the brain functions
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.100]   for which we've never observed before in human history.
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:26.760]   We have our Einsteins and our Feynmans and our Merzenics
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.860]   and it's unclear who to put in along that line side by side,
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:34.200]   but they're Michael Jordans and et cetera.
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:37.540]   But we've never heard of or seen somebody
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:40.040]   who can jump 20 feet in the air.
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.320]   Or we've heard of people who have photographic memories,
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:47.020]   but I don't know that we are aware of any human being
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:51.620]   in history who could memorize the entire library of Congress
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:55.260]   or all the works within the Vatican within an hour.
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:57.320]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:01.700]   What are your thoughts about manipulating neural circuitry
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:05.080]   to achieve superhuman or superhuman
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:07.080]   or super physiological functions?
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:10.420]   Are we there or should we even be thinking about that?
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:13.440]   Is it possible given that neurons simply communicate
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:15.420]   through electrical activity and electrical activity
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:17.880]   can be engineered outside of the brain?
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.420]   How do you think about it?
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:20.640]   And here we don't even have to think about
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:24.580]   Neural Link in particular, it's just but one example
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:26.420]   of companies and people in laboratories
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:30.460]   that are quite understandably considering all this.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:34.580]   - Well, it's a really interesting time right now.
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:37.580]   The science has been going on for decades.
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:39.420]   The work that we've done in this field
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:41.220]   that you call brain-machine interface
[02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:44.020]   has been going on for a while.
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:47.260]   And a lot of the early work was just trying to restore
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:50.100]   things like arm movement or having people
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.000]   or monkeys control a computer cursor, for example,
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.260]   on the screen, that's been going on for decades.
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:06:01.180]   What's been really new is that industry is now involved
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:03.640]   and some of this is now becoming commercialized
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:08.180]   and we're starting to see us now cross over to this field
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:11.020]   where it's no longer just research
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:13.580]   that we're talking about medical products
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:16.740]   that are designed to be surgically implanted.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.360]   In some cases, there's people doing this kind of work
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:22.780]   non-invasively as well that don't require surgery.
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.800]   The specific question that you're asking about
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.940]   is an area that we call augmentation.
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:34.940]   So can you build a device that essentially enhances
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:41.340]   someone's ability beyond super normal, super memory,
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:46.980]   super communication speeds beyond speech, for example?
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.980]   I guess superior precision athletic abilities.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:58.440]   I think that these are very serious kind of questions
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.900]   to be asking now because, as you mentioned,
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:05.000]   the pathway so far is really to focus
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.860]   on these medical applications.
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:10.200]   I personally don't think that we've thought enough,
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:12.400]   actually, about what these kind of scenarios
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.840]   are gonna look like.
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:14.920]   And I don't think we've thought through
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.440]   all the ethical implications of what this means
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.960]   for augmentation in particular.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:26.780]   There's part of this that is not new at all.
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:30.860]   Humans throughout history have been doing things
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:32.500]   to augment our function.
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:36.940]   Coffee, nicotine, all kinds of things,
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:39.720]   all kinds of medications that cross over
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:44.240]   from medical to consumer, that is everywhere.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:47.880]   So the pursuit of augmentation or performance
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:50.700]   or enhancement is really not a new thing.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:55.680]   The questions really, as they relate to neurotechnologies,
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:59.840]   for example, have to do with the invasive nature.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.200]   For example, if these technologies require surgery,
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.700]   for example, to do something that is not
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:07.880]   for a medical application.
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:12.140]   Again, there, that is not exactly new territory either.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:15.760]   People do that routinely for cosmetic kind of procedures,
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.840]   for physical appearance, not necessarily cognitive.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.840]   So I do think that provided the technology continues
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.680]   to emerge the way that it does,
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:29.480]   that it's gonna be around the corner.
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:30.880]   And it probably is not gonna be in ways
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.480]   that are super obvious.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.320]   I don't think it's gonna be like,
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:37.200]   can we easily memorize every fact in the world?
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:40.240]   But in forms that are gonna be much more incremental
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.680]   and maybe more subtle, in many ways,
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:44.860]   we already have that now.
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.540]   Like, for example, you don't have to have
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.600]   a neural interface embedded in your brain
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.380]   to get information, essentially access
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:53.140]   to all information in the world.
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:55.780]   You just have to have your iPhone.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:09:00.520]   Whether you could do it faster through a brain interface,
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:04.440]   I definitely wouldn't rule that out.
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.220]   But think about this, that the systems that we have already
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:11.940]   to speak and to communicate have evolved over,
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.560]   you know, thousands and millions of years.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.240]   And they're supported by neural structures
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.560]   that have bandwidth of millions of neurons.
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:24.960]   There's no technology that exists right now
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.240]   that people are thinking about
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.400]   that are in commercial form, certainly.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.060]   Not even in research labs that come anywhere close
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:35.880]   to what has been evolved for those natural purposes.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.520]   So I'm essentially saying two sides of this,
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.200]   which is we're already getting into this now.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.460]   This is not new territory, this topic of augmentation,
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.900]   both physical and cognitive.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:49.860]   We've already surpassed that.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:53.840]   That's part of what humans do in general.
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.000]   But we are entering this area of enhanced cognition,
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.600]   these areas that I think the technology
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:04.760]   is gonna be the rate-limiting step in how far we can go.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:07.580]   We have not had the full conversations about,
[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:11.260]   number one, is this what we actually want?
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:13.000]   Is this gonna be good for society?
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.600]   Who gets access to this technology?
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:16.880]   These are all things that are gonna
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.700]   become real-world problems.
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:21.380]   - There's certainly a lot to consider.
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.500]   In thinking about augmentation,
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:26.880]   and another theme that I've yet to ask you about,
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.280]   but I'm extremely curious about,
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:30.640]   which is facial expressions.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.200]   Before we talk about the relationship
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.880]   between the musculature of the face and language
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.620]   and the communication of emotion,
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:40.280]   I'd love for you to, if you would,
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.640]   touch on a little bit of what you're doing
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:43.000]   with patients like Pancho,
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.260]   to move beyond somebody who's locked in,
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.520]   being able to type out words on a screen
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:49.580]   with their thoughts.
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:53.120]   There's a rich array of information
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.800]   contained within the face and facial expression.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:57.600]   And while somebody like Pancho,
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.980]   going from having to be completely locked in
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.700]   to being able to peck out letters on a keyboard,
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:05.420]   to being able to just think of those letters
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:06.360]   and having them spelled out,
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:11.320]   that's a tremendous set of leaps forward towards normalcy.
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.760]   It's still far and away different
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:16.260]   than Pancho speaking with his mouth,
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:19.720]   which I think knowing some people who are restricted,
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.080]   who are quadriplegic,
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.040]   a lot of what they struggle with in the real world
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:25.800]   is actually a height difference sometimes
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.840]   because they're seated while other people are standing.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:29.820]   This actually, we don't often think about this,
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:31.920]   but always have to look up to communicate with people.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:34.600]   It's a very different interface in the world.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:35.840]   They manage quite well, of course,
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:38.300]   but could you tell us what you're doing
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:41.360]   in terms of merging the brain machine interface
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.200]   with extraction of speech signals
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.600]   from people who are locked in like Pancho
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.020]   with facial expressions?
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:48.100]   - Sure, yeah.
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:53.100]   Well, like we described before, progress is being made.
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:56.240]   The proof of principle is out there
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.780]   that you can decode speech.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:59.220]   That will continue to optimize,
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:02.400]   and I'm very confident that that's gonna improve
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.880]   very, very quickly in the coming years
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.360]   to the point where it's like not just a small vocabulary
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:12.180]   but a large vocabulary and at reasonable rates,
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.040]   at a level that's gonna be really helpful.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.740]   I'm very optimistic about that.
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.800]   I think it's the right time
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.640]   to start really thinking about a broader vision
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:22.600]   of what communication really is.
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.560]   So for example, I'm here with you in person.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:29.080]   We could have done this virtually, probably.
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:30.320]   It's pretty easy to do that.
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.560]   We could have recorded this really separate,
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.220]   but there is something about being able
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:36.860]   to actually see your expressions
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.440]   and to understand other forms of communication.
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.280]   So another really important one is nonverbal,
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:49.020]   the expressions that you're making.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.260]   For example, if you have a quizzical look on your face,
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.240]   if I'm saying something not clear,
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.760]   that's a sign to me that I need to rephrase it
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.740]   or to say it in a different way or to slow down.
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:01.260]   For example, or if there's something
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:02.320]   that really excites you,
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:04.080]   I wanna continue to say more about it
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.880]   and talk more in detail, essentially, about a given thing.
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.300]   So facial expressions actually are a really important part
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:15.400]   of the way we speak and there's two things.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:19.280]   It's not just the expressions of how you're feeling
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.520]   and perceiving what I'm saying,
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.120]   but it's also seeing my mouth move.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:27.200]   In your eyes, I actually see my mouth move
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.080]   and my jaw move in a particular way
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:32.760]   that actually allows you to hear those sounds better.
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.880]   So having both the visual information,
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.720]   but also the sounds go into your brain
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:41.680]   is going to improve intelligibility,
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.680]   also make it more natural.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.720]   - And memory for what is spoken?
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:47.560]   - Perhaps.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:48.920]   - So here's a call for people,
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.200]   not just listening to podcasts,
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:52.720]   but watching them and listening to them on YouTube,
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:56.720]   I suppose, if we were to translate this to the real world.
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.760]   - Exactly, and the reason why we're also very interested
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.680]   in this idea of not just having text on a screen,
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:09.640]   but essentially a fully computer-animated face,
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:13.840]   like an avatar of the person's speech movements
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:16.100]   and their facial expressions,
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:19.340]   is gonna be a more complete form of expression.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:23.060]   Now, you can imagine right now,
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:25.560]   that might just be someone looking at a computer screen
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.840]   interpreting these signals,
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.720]   but I think the way things are going
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:31.120]   in the next couple of years,
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.320]   a lot more of our social interactions,
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:34.920]   more than even now,
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.900]   are gonna move into this digital virtual space.
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:40.480]   And of course, most people are thinking about
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.340]   what that means for most consumers,
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:45.320]   but it also has really important implications
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.080]   for people who are disabled, right?
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.400]   And how are they gonna participate in that?
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:52.120]   And so we're thinking really about,
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.880]   for people like Pancho and other people who are paralyzed,
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.600]   what other forms of BCI can we do
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:02.960]   in order to help improve their ability to communicate?
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.080]   So one is essentially building out more holistic avatars,
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.840]   things that can essentially decode,
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:14.100]   essentially, their expressions
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:18.080]   or the movements associated with their mouth and jaw
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:21.500]   when they actually speak to improve that communication.
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:24.260]   - So do you envision a time not too long from now
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.900]   where instead of tweeting out something in text,
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:29.340]   my avatar will, I'll type it out,
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.120]   but my avatar will just say it.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.680]   It'll be an image of my avatar saying,
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:35.360]   whatever it is I happen to be tweeting at that moment.
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.620]   - That's what we're working on, yeah.
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:39.800]   So I don't think that that is gonna happen
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:40.920]   and it's gonna happen soon.
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:43.340]   And there's a lot of progress in that.
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.100]   And again, we're just trying to enrich
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:50.520]   the field of communication expression
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.760]   to make it more normal.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:56.680]   And we actually think that having that kind of avatar
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:58.760]   is a way of getting feedback to people
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:02.120]   learning how to speak through a speech neuroprosthetic,
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.320]   that's the device that we call it,
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:05.320]   it's a speech neuroprosthetic,
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.240]   that that is gonna be the way that can help people
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:09.800]   learn how to do it the quickest,
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:11.800]   not necessarily like trying to say words
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.600]   and having it come on a screen,
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.400]   but actually have people embody,
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:18.320]   feel like it's part of themselves
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.040]   or that they are directly controlling that,
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:22.960]   that illustration or animation.
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:28.480]   - This idea of an avatar speaking out
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.480]   what we would otherwise write
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.700]   is fascinating to me on Instagram.
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:35.520]   I post videos, I don't filter them,
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:38.000]   but I know there's a lot of discussion nowadays
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.920]   about people using filters
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.120]   to make their skin look different
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.260]   or the lighting look different,
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.920]   a lot of filtering and also the use of captions.
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.300]   So that essentially what you end up with
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:49.960]   is somewhere between an actual raw video
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:53.040]   of what was spoken and an avatar version of it.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.080]   I mean, if the mismatch between what's spoken
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:57.660]   and what's in the caption is too dramatic,
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:58.720]   then it doesn't quite work.
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:01.980]   But I watch these carefully when people use captions
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.520]   and oftentimes there's a smoothing
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.760]   of what was said into the caption
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:08.160]   so it seems much more succinct and accurate.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:10.200]   Oftentimes the reverse is also true
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.580]   where the caption is inaccurate
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:14.560]   and then it creates this kind of jarring mismatch.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:17.440]   In any case, I think this aspect in the clinical realm
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.760]   of using an avatar to allow people like Poncho
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:22.060]   to essentially be a face that communicates
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:25.440]   through spoken language from an avatar that looks like them
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:28.360]   is fascinating and indeed important.
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:32.300]   And I think how avatars emerge in social spaces
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:34.660]   is going to be really fascinating.
[02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:37.120]   I get a lot of questions about stutter.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.580]   I think that for people who have a stutter,
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:42.240]   it is itself anxiety provoking.
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.860]   - Is stutter related to anxiety?
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:49.280]   If one has a stutter, what can they do?
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:55.520]   Does stutter reflect some underlying neurologic phenomenon
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:58.500]   that might distinguish between one kind of stutter
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.760]   and another?
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:01.180]   What can people with stutter do
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:02.660]   if they'd like to relieve their stutter?
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:04.120]   - Yeah, great question.
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:10.440]   Stutter is a condition where the words
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:11.580]   can't come out fluently.
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:13.060]   So you have all the ideas.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:14.600]   You've got the language intact.
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:16.140]   You know, remember we talked about this distinction
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:18.080]   between language and speech.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.240]   Stuttering is a problem of speech, right?
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.240]   So the ideas, the meanings, the grammar,
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:25.400]   it's all there and people stutter,
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:28.300]   but they can't get the words out fluently.
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:30.940]   So that's a speech condition.
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:32.820]   And in particular, it's a condition
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:35.880]   that affects articulation,
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.140]   specifically about controlling the production of words
[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:42.380]   in this really coordinated kind of movements
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.420]   that have to happen in the vocal tract
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:47.480]   to produce fluent speech.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.860]   And stuttering is a condition
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:55.680]   where people have a predisposition to it.
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.660]   So there's an aspect of stuttering.
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:02.200]   You are a stutterer or you're not a stutterer, right?
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.080]   But people who stutter don't stutter all the time either.
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:09.380]   So you could be a stutterer who stutters at some times,
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:11.180]   but not others.
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:15.480]   And really the main link between stuttering and anxiety
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:20.480]   is that anxiety can provoke it and make it worse.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.100]   That's certainly true,
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:26.860]   but it's not necessarily caused by anxiety.
[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:30.680]   It can essentially trigger it or make it worse,
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:33.360]   but it's not the cause of it per se.
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.460]   So the cause of it is still really not clear,
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:40.180]   but it does have to do with these kind of brain functions
[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:42.300]   that we've been talking about earlier,
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:47.300]   which is that in order to produce normal fluent speech,
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:51.880]   we're not even conscious of what is going on in our mouths,
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:53.060]   in our larynx.
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:54.380]   We're not conscious, and if we were,
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:57.240]   we'd not be able to speak because it's too complex.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:58.800]   It's too precise.
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.780]   It's something that we have really developed
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:04.900]   the abilities to do, and we do it naturally, right?
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:06.060]   It's part of our programming
[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:08.300]   and part of what we learn inherently.
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.380]   And it's just through exposure.
[02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:16.380]   So stuttering is essentially a breakdown at certain times
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:21.220]   in that machinery being able to work
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:22.800]   in a really coordinated way.
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:26.580]   You can think about the operations of these areas
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:28.460]   that are controlling the vocal tract.
[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:30.060]   Let's say speech is like a symphony.
[02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:31.740]   In order for it to come out normally,
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:35.740]   you've got to have not just one part, the larynx,
[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:37.000]   but the lips, the jaw.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.980]   They can't be doing their own thing.
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:43.940]   They have to be very, very precisely activated
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:45.860]   and very, very precisely controlled in a way
[02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:48.020]   to actually create words.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:49.140]   And so in stuttering,
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:51.620]   there's a breakdown of that coordination.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:53.100]   - If somebody has a stutter,
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:55.880]   is it better to address that early in life
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:59.720]   when there's still neuroplasticity that is very robust?
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:02.340]   And if so, what's the typical route for treatment?
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.940]   I have to imagine it's not brain surgery typically.
[02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:07.280]   I'm guessing there are speech therapists
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.280]   that people can talk to and they can help them work out
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:14.100]   where they're getting stuck
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:15.840]   in the relationship to anxiety.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:16.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:19.040]   I mean, part of it is about that anxiety,
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.880]   but a lot of it really has to do with therapy
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:28.140]   to sort of like work through and think of tricks basically
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.500]   sometimes to create conditions
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:32.280]   where you can actually get the words to come out.
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:34.220]   A lot of some forms of stuttering
[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:36.620]   are really initiation problems.
[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:39.340]   Just getting started itself is very hard.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:43.260]   You want to start with initial vowel or consonant,
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:44.760]   but it won't emit.
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.580]   And so a lot of that therapy is really just focusing on
[02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:54.580]   like how do you create the conditions for that to happen?
[02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:57.540]   There's another aspect to it that I find very interesting
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:00.360]   is that the feedback, essentially,
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:03.700]   what we hear ourselves say, for example,
[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:08.060]   and every time that I say a word,
[02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:09.460]   I'm also hearing what I'm saying,
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.980]   so that's what we call auditory feedback.
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:13.700]   That turns out to be very important,
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:15.860]   and sometimes when you change that,
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:18.220]   it can actually change the amount someone stutters
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:19.900]   for better or for worse.
[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:23.820]   And it's giving us a clue that the brain
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:27.300]   is not just focused on sending the commands out,
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:30.180]   but it's also possibly interacting with the part
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:32.080]   that is hearing the sounds,
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.620]   and there's something might be going on in that connection
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:37.660]   that breaks down when stuttering occurs.
[02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:41.140]   So there are individuals that are stutterers,
[02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:43.200]   but they don't stutter all the time.
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:45.320]   In those instances, there's something happening
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:49.120]   in those particular moments where this very,
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:53.140]   very precise coordination needs to happen in the brain
[02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:54.980]   in order to get the words out fluently.
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:56.540]   - We talked a little bit about caffeine
[02:22:56.540 --> 02:22:57.680]   and why you avoid it.
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:01.760]   Because your work requires such precision and calm
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.640]   and frankly, to me, it seems like you're running
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.880]   a lot of operations, and no pun intended,
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.980]   in parallel when you're doing surgery,
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:11.100]   not just thinking about where to direct the instruments,
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.460]   but also thinking like a chess player
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.660]   several steps down the line, what could happen,
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:18.060]   what if, if then type thinking.
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:20.520]   What are some of the other practices and tools
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:23.360]   that you use to put yourself into state
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:27.440]   for optimal neurosurgery or for, you know,
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.620]   thinking about scientific problems for that matter?
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.340]   We keep threatening to go running together,
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:33.840]   but I know you run, correct?
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:35.040]   - Yeah.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.460]   - Do you find running to be an essential part
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:40.320]   of your state regulation?
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.640]   - Absolutely.
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:45.760]   Yeah, so for me, most exercise that I do,
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.120]   I really don't do for physical reasons.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.780]   I do it for mental reasons.
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:55.780]   I can tell, for example, if I don't go on a run or a swim
[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.140]   just after a day or two,
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:00.320]   and it can have translation, for example,
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:02.360]   in the way I feel in the operating room
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.760]   or even the way I interact with other people.
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:07.900]   So there's no question that those, you know,
[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:09.820]   the mind and body are deeply connected.
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.720]   And for me personally,
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:15.760]   being able to have opportunity to disconnect for a while,
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:18.360]   it turns out to be really, really important.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:22.960]   Now, the operating room for me is another space,
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:26.400]   kind of like running or swimming,
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:30.160]   where I'm disconnected from the rest of the world.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.120]   I don't bring my cellphone into the operating room.
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:37.080]   I'm disconnected from the external world
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.280]   for that time that I'm in the surgery.
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.860]   And all I am doing is just focusing.
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.920]   Now, that doesn't mean that I'm having complex thoughts
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:47.280]   or doing something very complicated.
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:50.780]   Sometimes it is like that, but it's not always like that.
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:53.480]   There are things that we do in surgery
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:58.480]   that are like routine and rote and are from muscle memory.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.120]   So for example, suturing skin
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:04.180]   or doing certain kinds of dissection
[02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:06.060]   or drilling part of the bone, for example,
[02:25:06.060 --> 02:25:09.240]   these are all things that become very rote after a time.
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:12.200]   So for me, even being in the operating room
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:14.240]   actually can sometimes fulfill that purpose.
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:18.560]   So I really look forward to being in the operating room
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.560]   because that intense focus allows me to sort of disconnect
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:26.200]   from all the other things that I'm worrying about,
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:30.100]   you know, that are happening on the outside world.
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:32.280]   You know, we all have those kinds of things that happen
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:35.360]   and I'm certainly no exception to that.
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:40.000]   But strangely, the operating room for me is a sanctuary.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.880]   I love being there because we have some control
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:45.940]   over the environment.
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:51.120]   I know what is there.
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:52.820]   I know the anatomy of the brain.
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:57.560]   My motions are going through routines.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:00.520]   And so for me, that's not actually very different
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:03.200]   than going on a run and letting my, you know,
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.840]   legs move in specific ways.
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:08.480]   It's just the same thing for my hands.
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.260]   - Do you listen to music or audio books when you run
[02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:14.560]   or are you divorced from technology when you run?
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:17.920]   - Well, music helps me like just stay motivated
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.560]   and distracted from being out of breath and other things.
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:25.400]   And for me, it's a way just to catch up with like the world.
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.080]   So sometimes I do, but I do notice
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:30.640]   that like I don't run as well, for example.
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:32.660]   In the operating room, it's a little different.
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:35.500]   You know, different surgeons have preferences.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:39.520]   I'm more of the camp where I don't like
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:41.220]   any distraction whatsoever.
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:43.600]   I'd like people to be able to hear the words
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.440]   that I'm saying without having background noise.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.320]   I don't really think about relying on music
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.320]   or other things to try to put me in a state of mind.
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:57.160]   You know, I think just being there alone
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.280]   and just, you know, trying to treat it the way it is.
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.280]   It's a sacred moment where someone's life
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:06.200]   is really directly under your hands.
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:09.240]   That enough kind of focuses me very quickly.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:11.200]   And I like that.
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:13.480]   It really detaches me from a lot of things
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:15.320]   that are preoccupying me.
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:18.880]   And for those couple of hours that we have a surgery,
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.220]   we're just focused on one thing only.
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.360]   - That's fantastic.
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:24.940]   Again, I think of in the range of brain explorers
[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:28.880]   that the neurosurgeons, those of your profession,
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:31.900]   are to me like the astronauts of neuroscience
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.080]   because they're really going
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:35.300]   to the farthest reaches possible.
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:36.720]   And they're testing and probing
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:39.760]   and really at the front edge of discovering
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.940]   from the species that we arguably care about the most,
[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:45.180]   which is humans.
[02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:50.180]   Eddie, I have to say from the first time we became friends,
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:52.560]   38 years ago.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.320]   - Something like that. - Something like that.
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:56.660]   I'm almost reluctant to say,
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:59.180]   but so I only reveal it in part
[02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:00.960]   that Eddie and I became friends
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.000]   because both he and I shared a love of birds
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.920]   and we had a club at our school
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.060]   of which there were only two members, Eddie and I.
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:12.760]   - Small club. - Small club.
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:14.240]   There was one honorary member
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:16.360]   and there were certain requirements for being in this club
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:17.320]   that we won't reveal.
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:19.040]   We took a pact of secrecy
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.920]   and we're going to obey that pact of secrecy.
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:23.720]   But to be sitting here with you today
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.540]   for me is a absolute thrill.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:30.160]   Not just because we've been friends for that long
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.500]   or that we got reacquainted
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:34.020]   through literally the halls of medicine and science,
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:37.280]   but because I really do see what you're doing
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:42.280]   as really representing that front absolute cutting edge
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:45.000]   of exploration and application.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.300]   I mean, the story of Poncho is but one of your many patients
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:51.680]   that has derived tremendous benefit from your work.
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:53.660]   And now as a chair of a department,
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:58.360]   you of course work alongside individuals
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:28:59.560]   who are also doing incredible work
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:01.720]   in the spinal cord, et cetera.
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.360]   So now on behalf of myself and everyone listening,
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:05.480]   I just really want to thank you
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:08.600]   for joining us today to share this information.
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:09.920]   We will certainly have you back
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:12.520]   because there's an entire list of other questions
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:14.080]   we didn't have time to get to,
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:15.680]   but also just for the work you do.
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:18.000]   It's truly spectacular.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.780]   - Andrew, thanks so much.
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.820]   You know, I'm very humbled basically by what you just said.
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:28.000]   And I feel that it's really an extraordinary honor,
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.260]   actually I'm privileged to be here with you
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:33.740]   to reconnect and talk about all these ideas.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:35.760]   It's probably not random, you know,
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:39.480]   that we ended up in similar spots and interests.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.000]   I think when we were kids, you know,
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.660]   it starts with some deep interests
[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:47.340]   and kind of nerding out on topics.
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:50.760]   And it's probably not a coincidence, you know,
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:54.800]   that we have such deep interest in this work now.
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.320]   I just feel really lucky to be able to do what I do.
[02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:00.920]   It's fun every day, almost every day,
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:03.420]   be able to go to work and take care of folks
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:06.500]   and learn at the same time and then just close the loop.
[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.200]   You know, how do we apply the knowledge
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:11.020]   that we learned one day to someone who comes in next week?
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:12.560]   It's really fun.
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:17.140]   And we don't know everything, we're not even close to it,
[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:22.560]   but the journey to figure this out is really extraordinary.
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:29.680]   I mean, it's like you said, it's exploring new lands,
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.640]   literally in the operating room when
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:35.600]   I'm looking at the exposed cortex trying to understand,
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:40.600]   is it safe to walk down this part of the cortical landscape
[02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:42.520]   or this other trail?
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:43.920]   You know, which one is going to be
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:46.800]   the one that is going to be safe versus the other that
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:49.360]   results in paralysis and inability to talk?
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:52.160]   Well, maybe I shouldn't call it fun,
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:56.000]   but it's very important too,
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.380]   in addition to being really intellectually important
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:31:00.680]   for how we understand how the brain works.
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:02.400]   And so, yeah, I feel just really lucky
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:03.760]   to be in that opportunity.
[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:05.660]   - And we're lucky to have you being
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:08.380]   one of the people doing it, so thank you ever so much.
[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:09.380]   - Thanks.
[02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:10.500]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:12.840]   for my discussion with Dr. Eddie Chang.
[02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:14.860]   If you'd like to learn more about his research
[02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:17.120]   into the neuroscience of speech and language
[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:20.320]   and bioengineering, his treatment of epilepsy
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:23.660]   and other aspects and diseases and disorders of the brain,
[02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:25.960]   please check out the links in our show note captions.
[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:28.080]   We have links to his laboratory website,

[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:33.200]   related to his critical research as well.
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:34.600]   If you're learning from and are enjoying
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:36.000]   the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:07.360]   Not so much today, but in many previous episodes
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:09.760]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:13.980]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:32:13.980 --> 02:32:15.960]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.640]   and hormone optimization.
[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.660]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:20.280]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:21.120]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:22.440]   that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.900]   has partnered with Momentous on,
[02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:26.280]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:28.800]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:30.720]   And there you'll see a number of the supplements
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:32.680]   that we talk about regularly on the podcast.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.640]   I should just mention that that catalog of supplements
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:36.240]   is constantly being updated.
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:38.040]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:41.100]   the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel.
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:43.640]   That premium channel will feature monthly AMAs
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:46.520]   or ask me anythings where I answer your questions in depth,
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.480]   as well as other premium resources.

[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:23.100]   we have what is called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:25.540]   You can subscribe by going to HubermanLab.com,
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:27.380]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:30.140]   Those newsletters include summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:32.680]   lists of tools from the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:34.920]   And if you'd like to see previous newsletters
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:37.160]   we've released, you can also just go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.520]   click on newsletter in the menu,
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:40.760]   and you'll see various downloadable PDFs.
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.440]   If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:43.560]   we just ask for your email.
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:45.480]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:47.740]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:49.720]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:53.200]   it's Huberman Lab on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Instagram.
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:54.960]   And at all three of those places,
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:57.400]   I cover topics and subject matter
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:33:59.800]   that are sometimes overlapping with the information
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:01.240]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:03.280]   but that's often distinct from information
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:04.720]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:07.520]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:09.560]   Thank you once again for joining me today
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:12.080]   for the discussion about the neuroscience of speech,
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:16.040]   language, epilepsy, and much more with Dr. Eddie Chang.
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:19.100]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:21.680]   [upbeat music]
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:23.740]   you
