[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   - So what's your writing process like?
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.160]   What's your thinking and writing process like every day?
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.720]   What's your routine even?
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.840]   - Yeah, I guess it's actually the best question
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.840]   because I spend seven days a week doing it.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.080]   - You're the most prepared to answer it.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   - Yeah, but okay, so the chair I'm sitting in
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.520]   is where I do--
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.800]   - It's where the magic happens.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.120]   - Well, reading and writing.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.760]   The chair is usually sitting over there
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600]   where I have other books, some reference books,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600]   but I found this chair which was designed
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.880]   by a Swedish guy anyway.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.080]   Turns out this is the only chair I can really sit in
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.760]   for hours and hours and not know that I'm in a chair.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480]   But then I have the standup desk right next to us
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   and so after I write something with pencil and eraser,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.280]   I get up and I type it and revise and rewrite.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.320]   Standing up.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.760]   - The kernel of the idea is first put on paper.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.600]   - Yeah.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.420]   - That's where--
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.820]   - Right, and I'll write maybe five programs a week.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.360]   Of course, literate programming.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840]   And these are, before I describe something in my book,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960]   I always program it to see how it's working
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   and I try it a lot.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.400]   So, for example, I learned at the end of January,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.280]   I learned of a breakthrough by four Japanese people
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.680]   who had extended one of my methods in a new direction.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.100]   And so I spent the next five days writing a program
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.440]   to implement what they did and then I,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.880]   they had only generalized part of what I had done
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   so then I had to see if I could generalize more parts of it
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.720]   and then I had to take their approach
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.160]   and I had to try it out on a couple of dozen
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.760]   of the other problems I had already worked out
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.640]   with my old methods.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.520]   And so that took another couple of weeks
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.240]   and then I started to see the light
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.160]   and I started writing the final draft
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.640]   and then I would type it up,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.040]   involved some new mathematical questions
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.840]   and so I wrote to my friends
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920]   who might be good at solving those problems
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   and they solved some of them.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   So I put that in as exercises
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   and so a month later, I had absorbed one new idea
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.080]   that I learned and I'm glad I heard about it in time,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.920]   otherwise I wouldn't put my book out
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160]   before I'd heard about the idea.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.680]   On the other hand, this book was supposed to come in
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.480]   at 300 pages and I'm up to 350 now.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.880]   That added 10 pages to the book
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.400]   but if I learn about another one,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200]   my publisher's gonna shoot me.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.840]   (Lex laughing)
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.200]   - Well, so in that process, in that one month process,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   are some days harder than others?
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080]   - Are some days harder than others?
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.420]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.480]   My work is fun but I also work hard
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.260]   and every big job has parts
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.420]   that are a lot more fun than others.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.040]   And so many days I'll say,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.480]   why do I have to have such high standards?
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.600]   Why couldn't I just be sloppy and not try this out
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.360]   and just report the answer?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   But I know that people are counting me to do this
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.200]   and so, okay, so okay, Don, I'll grit my teeth and do it.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   And then the joy comes out when I see that actually,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   I'm getting good results and I get,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.280]   and even more when I see that somebody
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.760]   has actually read and understood what I wrote
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.840]   and told me how to make it even better.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   I did wanna mention something about the method.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.960]   So I got this tablet here where--
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.400]   - Wow.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   - Where I do the first writing of concepts, okay?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.240]   So--
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   - And what language is that then?
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960]   (Lex laughing)
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.680]   - Right, so take a look at it
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.000]   but here, you randomly say,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.480]   explain how to draw such skewed pixel diagrams, okay?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.760]   So I got this paper about 40 years ago
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   when I was visiting my sister in Canada
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   and they make tablets of paper
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.080]   with this nice large size and just the right--
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.800]   - Very small space between lines.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.360]   - Small spaces, yeah, yeah, take a look.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.520]   - Maybe I'll also just show it.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   - Yeah.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.380]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680]   - You know, I've got these manuscripts
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.080]   going back to the '60s.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   And those are when I'm getting my ideas on paper, okay?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.800]   But I'm a good typist.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   In fact, I went to typing school when I was in high school
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.720]   and so I can type faster than I think.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.160]   So then when I do the editing, stand up and type,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.920]   then I revise this and it comes out a lot different
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.000]   than what, for style and rhythm and things like that
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   come out at the typing stage.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.040]   - And you type in tech.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.320]   - And I type in tech.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   - And can you think in tech?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.920]   - No.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.720]   To a certain extent, I have only a small number
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.600]   of idioms that I use, like, you know,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.840]   I'm beginning a theorem, I do something for,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.040]   displayed equation, I do something and so on.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.200]   But I have to see it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.440]   - In the way that it's on paper here.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.280]   - Yeah, right.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.560]   - For example, Turing wrote, what, The Other Direction.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   You don't write macros, you don't think in macros.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.200]   - Not particularly, but when I need a macro,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.000]   I'll go ahead and do it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.960]   But the thing is, I also write to fit.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   I mean, I'll change something if I can save a line.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.920]   You know, it's like haiku.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.000]   I'll figure out a way to rewrite the sentence
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.320]   so that it'll look better on the page.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   And I shouldn't be wasting my time on that,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.320]   but I can't resist because I know it's only another 3%
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   of the time or something like that.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   - And it could also be argued that that is what
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   life is about.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.660]   - Ah, yes, in fact, that's true.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.560]   Like, I work in the garden one day a week,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   and that's kind of a description of my life,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.000]   is getting rid of weeds, you know,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.040]   removing bugs from programs.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.720]   - So, you know, a lot of writers talk about,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.080]   you know, basically suffering, the writing processes,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.240]   having, you know, it's extremely difficult.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.280]   And I think of programming, especially,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.920]   or technical writing that you're doing, can be like that.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.560]   Do you find yourself, methodologically,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.080]   how do you, every day, sit down to do the work?
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.680]   Is it a challenge?
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.880]   You kind of say it's, you know, it's fun.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.960]   (laughs)
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.280]   But it'd be interesting to hear if there are non-fun parts
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   that you really struggle with.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.780]   - Yeah, so the fun comes when I'm able to put together
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.560]   ideas of two people who didn't know about each other,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   and so I might be the first person
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.360]   that saw both of their ideas.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.040]   And so then, you know, then I get to make the synthesis,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.280]   and that gives me a chance to be creative.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.760]   But the dredge work is where I've got to
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.840]   chase everything down to its root.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.320]   This leads me into really interesting stuff.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.880]   I mean, I learn about Sanskrit, and I,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.720]   (laughs)
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.880]   and, you know, I try to give credit to all the authors,
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   and so I write to people who know the people,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.160]   authors, if they're dead, or I communicate this way.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.600]   And I got to get the math right,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.620]   and I got to tack all my programs,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.960]   try to find holes in 'em.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   And I rewrite the programs after I get a better idea.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.080]   - Is there ever dead ends?
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.920]   - Dead ends?
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.200]   Oh yeah, I throw stuff out, yeah.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.480]   One of the things that I,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.880]   I spend a lot of time preparing a major example
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.480]   based on the game of baseball.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.640]   And I know a lot of people who,
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.960]   for whom baseball is the most important thing in the world.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.880]   But I also know a lot of people
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   for whom cricket is the most important,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.160]   in the world, or soccer or something.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.000]   - Soccer, yeah.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.160]   - And I realized that if I had a big example,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.960]   I mean, it was gonna have a fold-out illustration
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.920]   and everything.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.760]   And I was saying, well,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   what am I really teaching about algorithms here,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.920]   where I had this baseball example?
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   And if I was a person who knew only cricket,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.360]   wouldn't they, what would they think about this?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.040]   And so I've ripped the whole thing out,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.280]   but I had something that would have really appealed
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.080]   to people who grew up with baseball
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.320]   as a major theme in their life.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.360]   - Which is a lot of people, but.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.520]   - But just, yeah.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.080]   - But still a minority.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   - Small minority.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.280]   I took out bowling, too.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.840]   - Even a smaller minority.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.100]   (laughing)
