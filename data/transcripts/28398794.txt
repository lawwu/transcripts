[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.820]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.540]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.300]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.000]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.260]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.340]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.820]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.900]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.080]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.160]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.040]   But don't forget,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.500]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.200]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.920]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.020]   Well, listeners, I am excited to welcome you
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.020]   to this wonderful fall day podcast
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.960]   here at the end of October.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   The end of October has always, at our house,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.660]   been a special time in homeschooling.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.800]   I remember when my girls were really, really young
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.500]   and we had just started homeschooling.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.060]   Late October was that time
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.820]   when I began to get a little itchy.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.820]   I began to think, yeah, this is going pretty well,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.640]   but am I doing everything I'm supposed to be doing?
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.080]   Or some years, man, this is getting sort of hard
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.880]   and I feel like we might be in a rut
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   and now I'm wondering, is this what I'm supposed to be doing?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.760]   Am I doing everything I'm supposed to do?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   Are my girls getting everything they're supposed to get?
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.520]   I also know that this time of year
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   is when folks who have kids that are maybe three or four
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.680]   and they're not officially homeschooling yet,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.600]   but as the fall rolls on and the new year approaches,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.500]   they began to think, what am I gonna do with my kids?
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.480]   Am I really gonna try this homeschooling thing?
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720]   And what would that really look like?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   And am I able to do that and where do I even go for advice?
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so today I have invited a good friend,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.460]   Katie Beth Pearson, homeschooling mom
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.800]   with some experience under her belt to join me today.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   And we are gonna talk about advice, right?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.400]   For getting started as a homeschooler,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   advice for those of you with young children
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.480]   who are wondering, am I doing it right?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.240]   Am I doing enough?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.880]   What's a better way to get started
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   and prepare our family to love learning together so much
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   that we can stick it out till the very end.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400]   Katie Beth, thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   - Oh, thank you for inviting me, Lisa.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.720]   This is quite the honor.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   - Well, every time I talk to you about homeschooling,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560]   I feel like our enthusiasm feeds off of each other.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   And I thought, what better way to encourage some moms
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   and dads who may be having a few qualms
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.600]   or even if things are going great.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   And this happened to me sometimes in the early years,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.600]   things would be going along really smoothly
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.200]   and I would begin to think, but as there's something else,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.160]   this seems too easy.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.080]   Something must be wrong.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   Is there something else I'm supposed to be thinking?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.080]   So I just thought we would put everybody's mind at rest
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.800]   and hey, maybe give people something new
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.720]   to think about to boot.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.160]   - Let me ask you this.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.000]   How long have you homeschooled?
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   - I love that question because I like to say
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.320]   I've homeschooled since I became a mother, right?
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.040]   Because education is not just about the academics.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.920]   So I absolutely take credit in teaching my daughters to walk
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.000]   and in potty training them because I was teaching them,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700]   teaching them table manners.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.540]   But how long have I taken on the sole responsibility
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.780]   of educating my children academically
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.420]   was six weeks into pre-K for my first child.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.020]   I always knew the second we found out we were pregnant
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.560]   and we were starting our family,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.440]   I always knew I wanted to homeschool my kids.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   But I did not feel equipped to teach them the basics.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.840]   The squiggly line here is an M
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.140]   or this bumpy shape right here is the number three
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.820]   and what that meant.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.480]   So I felt like I could just outsource their academics
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.680]   for the first few years and let somebody else take control
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.520]   of giving them those foundational bits of knowledge
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.960]   and then I could take it from there.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.380]   You know, the Lord just grabs you by the heart
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.280]   and tells you, "Ma'am, when I convict you of something,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.600]   "I don't mean for you to outsource that."
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.160]   And so about six weeks into pre-K,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.040]   I was humbled and utterly exhausted from the routine
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.380]   of taking my child to preschool
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.400]   and I had a brand new baby on my hip at the time
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   and it was just, I was putting in more work emotionally
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.520]   and time-wise just for her to go to a preschool
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.240]   and I wasn't seeing any kind of emotional return
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.080]   from my daughter.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   She was exhausted.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.760]   She was not necessarily enjoying the time.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.600]   I wasn't enjoying it and I missed her
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.880]   'cause she was a cool person
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.460]   and it was that time when I was like,
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.220]   "Okay, I guess I'll share you with somebody else now."
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.700]   So my husband and I had a conversation over dinner
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.040]   and we regrouped and we decided that
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.640]   if I was gonna homeschool, what better time than to do it
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.040]   in the moment that I felt convicted about it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.640]   So we unenrolled her from the public school
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.660]   and just took time to figure it out.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.600]   So my oldest daughter is 17.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   So I'll claim 17 years of homeschooling
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.500]   but I think if I were to do the math,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.100]   I think she might've been four when she was in preschool.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.440]   So 13 years of academics.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.180]   - Oh, that is so cool.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.860]   And let me ask you this and it can just be a short answer.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.220]   We're gonna dive into it more deeply, I'm sure.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.660]   Has it always been easy, Katie Bess?
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.300]   - Oh, no ma'am.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.000]   I've done so many things in my life
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.240]   and I think homeschooling my children
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.540]   has been probably the most humbling job I've ever had.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.040]   So no, but it has been rewarding.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   It has been beautiful moments of watching things click
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.820]   with my children that I would've missed out on,
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   that I would've had to forfeit if they were in a classroom.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.400]   But then there were those terrible times
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   of watching them wrestle
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   and it's hard to watch your child wrestle with something.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   You understand it because you're an adult and you've seen it
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.840]   and you had your own wrestling match with it.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.720]   And so you just want it to come to them.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   And in the moment, I just wanted to fix it for them.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.700]   And looking back and watching the reward
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.580]   of something coming together that they've wrestled through
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.880]   and clicking and that was worth so much more
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.980]   than them never having to wrestle through it to begin with.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.980]   So no, it's by no means has it been easy or simple,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.980]   but it has been the most rewarding thing
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.060]   I think I've tackled as an adult.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060]   - One of the best things I think that you could ever say
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:05.360]   to encourage young families, you just said,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:12.640]   wrestling is important for our children to do.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   And a lot of times I think when we start out homeschooling,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.840]   we want to make learning for our children,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   obviously appealing and fun and doable.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.420]   And we feel like, we feel this, I know I did,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.280]   I felt this huge burden to make school
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.040]   and learning easy for my kids.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.160]   Oh, I've got to make it easy and if it's not,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.880]   if it's not easy, then probably I'm doing it wrong.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.560]   And I wrestled with that so much.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   But your great wisdom is that wrestling is important
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.640]   for our children and that everybody is not gonna get
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.320]   the concept right away and that's okay.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.280]   Sometimes the deepest lessons that our children learn
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.200]   are in the midst of the wrestling to get through it,
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.400]   the wrestling to find the breakthrough
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   that cements that idea in your head.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.480]   And so that's a great piece of wisdom.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.800]   - Because you fought for it, right?
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.200]   Because it didn't just get handed to you, you dug in,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.400]   you stubbornly decided this was not gonna defeat me,
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.000]   this is going to be my triumph.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.440]   So it makes that so much sweeter when it didn't defeat you,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.960]   even if it felt like it had defeated you
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.920]   time and time again beforehand.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.320]   So yeah, when you wrestle with something,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.520]   you're earning those stripes.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.600]   You're not just giving, being handed them.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.400]   - I think that's myth number one
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.040]   that we'll just bust right now.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.720]   It's supposed to be easy.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.880]   It's not supposed to be easy.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.680]   It's not supposed to be easy for the student
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.560]   and it's not supposed to be easy for us.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.040]   What is something that you have learned in your,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.480]   I don't know, either 12 or 17, however you count it,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.000]   what is something that you, that is totally not
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.920]   what you expected about homeschooling?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.440]   - So a little background first.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.120]   I was publicly educated my whole life.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.400]   And then I went to college and when I went to college,
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   I volunteered at our local school district
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.520]   in the high school.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.600]   My neighbor was the only high school English teacher
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.680]   in the whole town.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.040]   So she needed some help and I didn't mind it, I loved her.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   But what I noticed was that the parents of these students
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.840]   that I was helping, they knew of their children,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.800]   but they didn't seem to know their children.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.120]   They knew, you know, my kid plays soccer
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.240]   or my child is weak in math,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.200]   but they didn't really know their children
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.840]   in a way that I felt like I wanted to know my own children.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.320]   What I didn't expect when I decided to homeschool
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.360]   or when my husband and I decided to homeschool
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.240]   was that we wouldn't know of our children.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.640]   We would know our children.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.580]   - And it's a beautiful intimacy that I have with them
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.520]   where I just know what to expect when my kids wake up
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.360]   and they have a certain look on their face
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   and I know, oh, today's gonna be a grumpy day.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.880]   Or they're just boiling with excitement
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.560]   because they finished that wrestling match
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.360]   and now they can't wait to show up to community day
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.800]   to boast about it, to present on it,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.280]   or to have conversations with their classmates
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.080]   because they've won the wrestling match at home
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.400]   and now they're just bursting with energy
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.720]   because they want to share that excitement
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.200]   with their classmates.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.360]   And it just in the look of an eye
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.960]   when they're glancing at me or even more richly,
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.280]   they know me and they know when I need a hug
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.520]   and they recognize that I'm not just an ATM.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.680]   I'm not a chauffeur.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.960]   I'm a person that they enjoy spending time with
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.280]   and I didn't expect that 'cause the world will tell you,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.860]   oh, little girls are great until they become teenagers
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.360]   and then they're tyrants.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.180]   And I've been waiting for that tyrant moment
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.880]   and it hasn't come yet, thank you, Jesus.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.560]   I don't think it will
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.880]   because we have this great relationship with each other
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.200]   because we spend so much time together.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.600]   - Yes, that's beautiful.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.520]   The whole idea that when you're homeschooling,
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.360]   you're not just guiding their academic growth
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.120]   but you're shepherding their heart.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   And like you said, you know each other intimately
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.640]   because you spend a lot of time together
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.720]   and you see each other in the waking moments
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.080]   and in the sleepy moments and in, like you said,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.600]   in the triumphant moments when they've gotten something
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.000]   and they're eager to share,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.060]   but also in the wrestling moments
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.280]   when something is coming hard
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.640]   or when something has broken their heart.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.640]   - I'm glad that you said that.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.620]   I feel like when we talk to people about homeschooling,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.060]   we don't make enough of that.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   We don't celebrate that enough.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.000]   Here's the truth, you guys,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.480]   about homeschooling your children.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   You won't just know if they're good at math
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.600]   or can really translate Latin
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.240]   without looking at the answer key.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   You will also know how they deal with disappointment.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.560]   You will also be able to see what hurts their heart.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.200]   You will be able to see that on their faces
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.720]   because you're with them.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:19.120]   The Lord will knit together the hearts of your family.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.700]   I know we homeschooled our girls the whole way
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.760]   and when our oldest left to go to college,
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.840]   it was very strange.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.920]   My husband cried for a week.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.880]   It was so hard.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   It was so different because as a pastor,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.280]   his office has always been in our home.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.200]   And so we have literally all been home together
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.660]   all the time forever.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.100]   And so we saw each other in the happy times
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.720]   and in the sad times and in the get along together times
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   and in the struggle to find peace in our home time.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.620]   But God had given us the gift of one another.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:08.440]   And so it's a heart knitting
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.440]   that is also a beautiful outgrowth of home education.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.640]   - Absolutely.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.180]   One of my daughters, when she's wrestling,
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.720]   it's a public affair.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.520]   She needs to talk it through.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.700]   She needs to bounce ideas off of each other.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.880]   She needs to hear other perspectives
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.960]   and it's very out in the open.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.560]   And my other daughter needs to be alone.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.080]   She needs to go in her room.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.200]   She needs to close the door.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.480]   She needs to privately wrestle
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.120]   and then think that she might have come up with
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.800]   her train of thought to gather her words,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.640]   to gather her language.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.940]   And then she'll come out and discuss it with us
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.480]   still with a loose grip on her opinions.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.900]   But it was interesting to me how differently
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.060]   my children wrestle with a hardship.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.640]   One is very public and very open to the noise
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.780]   and the other one, the noise is clutter.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.320]   And she needs to have that Jesus praying on the mountain top
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   kind of solitude to gather her own peace in the storm
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.800]   before she can tackle it outwardly.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.400]   And I don't think I would have known that
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   about either of them,
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.800]   had I not spent 24/7 shepherding them
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.120]   to find out how the Lord made them as fully formed people.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.940]   I'm not molding my children.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.140]   They have already been molded.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.280]   I'm just guiding them down the paths
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   the Lord has called them to.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   - That's lovely, that is lovely.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.920]   And so much of what we are privileged to do
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.320]   as homeschooling parents is not academic.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.640]   People start thinking, when people begin to consider
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.660]   whether or not they want to homeschool,
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.340]   what we mostly consider is, can I teach my child to read
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.240]   and what will I do when they get to calculus in high school
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.640]   because I hated math?
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.380]   We think about the academics.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.380]   We don't think about helping to fine tune their character
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.860]   or help them develop good health habits
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.620]   or guide them as they learn to manage a life,
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.460]   not just a mind.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.460]   And so that's something for all of us to think about.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.400]   Homeschooling is more than just book learning.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.900]   I am sure that you have changed something
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.540]   that you have changed some things
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.020]   about your homeschooling style over the year.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.420]   What would you say, what are the biggest changes
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.100]   in your homeschool style from the early days to now?
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.500]   And it might be because the age of your children,
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.780]   Katie Beth, or maybe it is because of something
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.740]   that you learned about better ways of teaching.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.620]   Hit us with that advice.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.900]   - Man, we were just talking about this a few weeks ago,
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.220]   my husband and myself, when we first started out,
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.180]   we didn't know what we were doing.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.060]   I only knew public school.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.980]   So I knew the classroom model with the desks and the chairs
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.660]   and the very regimented time hacks.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.320]   And so in my mind, I needed to do school at home
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.420]   with very individual desks for each child
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.740]   and a regimented schedule of reading time and math time.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.140]   And there's goodness and beauty to that,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.340]   but it was militant in my homeschool.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.340]   And it was unforgiving and it left no room
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.140]   for curiosity or interests.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.540]   I did not know about classical conversations
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.020]   when we first started out.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.700]   So we were going it alone.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.540]   We lived in an area where there weren't
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.540]   a whole lot of homeschoolers.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.380]   So I didn't have that big sister wisdom
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.340]   that you get in community.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.980]   I didn't have a family that I could say,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.420]   I like what I see when I'm looking at you.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.980]   Can you teach me your ways?
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.900]   What did you do wrong?
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.620]   What did you do well?
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.340]   And I didn't get those community days of lunchtime chatter
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.220]   and things like that.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   And it was like I was an isolated island winging it.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.300]   And so we tried a variety of options.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.060]   This was before social media.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.860]   So I just Google produced certain things,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.500]   but not a whole lot of things.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.220]   And so we tried unschooling, we tried eclectic,
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.080]   we tried a whole lot of different things.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.420]   But today we have found beauty in knowing a few core things.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:13.820]   We spend more time valuing the process than the product.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.720]   The product is good.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.020]   I don't want you to give sloppy work.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.020]   I don't want you to not pour yourself into it,
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.020]   but I also care more about how you got to your conclusions
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.020]   well before I ask, what is your conclusion?
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.420]   So I want to hear your thought processes.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.620]   I want to hear how you got to this answer,
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.580]   whether it's math or Latin declensions
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.220]   or even science fair project.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.700]   I want to know what led you to this.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.900]   And it's more conversational in my homeschool now.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.140]   We spend a lot of time, I have teenage girls,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.620]   we still cuddle on the couch and read a book together.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.980]   I don't, I think there'll be 30 years old
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.460]   and come visit my house and we'll cuddle on the couch
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.060]   and read a good book together.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.920]   You will, I bet.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.100]   I just hope so because it's such a precious time for us,
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.780]   especially as the weather cools off
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.820]   and it's blanket season.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.500]   So we have a favorite blanket that we like to cuddle under.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   And then we spend more time instead of opening a book
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.180]   with the intent of filling in answers.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.820]   We do open our books,
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   but it's more of a curiosity driven thing.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.120]   Whereas before I was a check box person,
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.620]   I liked to have my to-do list
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   and I like to check all of the boxes off on that to-do list
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.380]   and then I felt accomplished.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.500]   So we've changed quite a bit over the years.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.180]   And I think that's okay.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.420]   I think it's okay to look at what you're doing,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.460]   decide it's not what's best
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.500]   or it's not working the way you had envisioned
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.980]   and then pivot and try something else.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.220]   - Right, that's really smart.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.940]   I'm glad that you said that.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.780]   I feel like they're probably listeners
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.780]   who started out homeschooling in a certain way
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.020]   and maybe it was working or maybe it's never worked
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.620]   and they're afraid to change lanes.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.260]   Because as parents, we feel like,
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.220]   well, I should just commit to,
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.540]   I should commit to a lane in my homeschooling and stay there
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.460]   and jumping around is not helpful
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.620]   and it makes me look wishy-washy or like heaven forbid,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.020]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.340]   I think what Katie Beth and I would say to all of you guys
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.340]   is that it is actually not just okay
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.940]   but good to change your method
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.220]   or change what you're pursuing,
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.580]   especially how you're pursuing it
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.740]   if something doesn't work anymore.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.620]   Or if you have outgrown a certain method
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.820]   or if you see it really is not serving
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.500]   your child's learning style well.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.460]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.260]   - That's a good encouraging thing, Katie Beth.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.780]   Change is okay and it can actually be good
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:26.140]   and you should not be afraid to change what you're doing,
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.620]   especially in those early years.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.460]   You are not gonna mess up your child.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.540]   - Oh, no.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.860]   - You are learning, in essence, in the early years,
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.220]   you're actually learning along with your child
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.100]   because you're learning how do you learn,
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.740]   how do they learn, what are the options out there
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   for us and like you said, most of us try in the beginning
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.540]   to bring our public school experience home
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.500]   and we have a lot of checklists
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.940]   and we have a lot of seat work maybe
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.940]   or desk work or lessons to do.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.500]   And then as we relax and think,
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.340]   but what am I trying to teach my children?
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.980]   I'm trying to teach them to know God
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.380]   and to know his world and to love it
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.380]   and maybe a book or a list is not the best way to do that,
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.820]   at least not every day.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.340]   So make a change.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.020]   Katie Beth, you and I have a friend
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.620]   who has been seeking advice on getting started
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.460]   for her sister, her sister who has a little four-year-old
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.980]   and lots of people have weighed in with some awesome
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.860]   suggestions and I would like to get your take on these first
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:51.300]   and then I want some of your best ideas
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.460]   with your years of experience under your belt.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.420]   What are some of your best ideas for getting started?
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.780]   Okay, so one person said take lots of naps.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.620]   How do you feel about that?
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   Lisa, I have never taken a nap I regretted.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.900]   Can I just put that out there?
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.540]   I have avoided naps and I have regretted those,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.980]   but I have never regretted a nap in my adulthood
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.380]   that I have taken and some of my best naps
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.340]   were right alongside my babies
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.980]   when we were just too tired to keep going
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.300]   and we just cuddled up and dozed off for a little bit
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.380]   and the rest that you get from it
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.780]   and the precious moments of being still and silent,
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.900]   especially with your wiggling littles
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.580]   that just never stop moving,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.220]   you get that precious time together to take a nap.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.620]   So please prioritize nap time with the little ones.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.500]   Yeah, I agree, especially when your children are little.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.060]   So many of us feel like, oh, when we start,
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.260]   we've got to teach them to read
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.100]   and we need to know all about numbers
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.340]   and I want to teach them to draw
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.100]   and we're going to learn about science
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.220]   and we're going to do experiments every other day
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.180]   and we're going to learn to draw maps
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.380]   and we're going to read about people in other countries
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.860]   and it just makes you tired to think about it
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.580]   and think about how that feels to a little four,
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.580]   five, six year old who has not been designed to sit
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   for long periods of time in one spot.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.820]   They need to get up and run around
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.220]   and they need to run around a lot
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.860]   and it will make them tired
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.500]   and so taking a nap is a great thing.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.460]   Taking a rest is a good thing
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.780]   and following the rhythm of your body is good.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.780]   Lots of people weighed in on things like reading a lot
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.500]   and collecting books and going to the library
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   and availing themselves of the Copper Lodge books,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.540]   the old world echoes and the new world echoes
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.900]   and all kinds of stories.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.300]   How do you feel about reading with your children?
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   - Oh man, we love reading together
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.300]   and I'll tell you it's not always age appropriate books.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.580]   Not that they're inappropriate
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.660]   but there were times when my husband was working
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.340]   on his master's thesis
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.380]   and the girls just wanted time with daddy
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   and he had deadlines for papers
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.340]   and so instead of being holed up in his office
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.060]   and working on his paper,
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.100]   he would read some of his textbooks to them
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.340]   and they would be curled up in his lap
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.580]   and listening in and killing two birds with one stone
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.900]   but and then we would pull out poetry books and story books
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.260]   and books that tug at your heartstrings
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.100]   and teach you to cry and it's okay
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.220]   and then books that help you to laugh
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.260]   and what a beautiful way.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.260]   I don't think it's possible to own too many books.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.300]   I think it's possible to not own enough bookshelves.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.740]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.900]   - I think you can never overdo a book.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.540]   So absolutely bring books everywhere you go.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   Have one at the ready for the time at the bank
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.220]   when you're waiting in line to make your deposit
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.860]   or if you need to go get your oil changed,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.180]   pull that book out and start reading to your babies
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.460]   'cause it models for them that wonder and curiosity
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.260]   of what mysteries lie within those pages.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.700]   - I love it, that's great, great ideas.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.100]   Okay, somebody else said, get rain boots to play in the rain
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.300]   and a shovel to dig in the dirt
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.020]   and a magnifying glass to search out tiny wonders
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.220]   and a blanket to lie in the grass
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.260]   to search the wonder in the sky
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.740]   and a bucket to fill with rain and dirt and wonders.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.100]   What would you say to all of that?
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.260]   - Oh man, where was that knowledge and wisdom
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.060]   when I had littles?
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.020]   Those were things in my mind at the time
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.340]   that were clutter and messy.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.540]   - Well, and extra and if we have time
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   and when we're done with school, we will do all that.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.180]   - Let's do our history, let's work on our math
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.100]   and then if we have time before we have to make dinner,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.980]   we'll go splash in the mud.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.480]   Ma'am, let's make some time to splash in the mud,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.820]   put it in your schedule.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.260]   If you're a schedule-based person, you schedule messy time
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.220]   because those are the times that they will outgrow
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.500]   and then you'll find yourself in a park one day
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.940]   looking at a mama who does prioritize it and go,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.060]   oh, I wish I could be part of that right now.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.060]   - Yes, and the whole idea that that's how little people learn
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.460]   by moving their bodies out in the world
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.020]   and getting their hands dirty and touching things
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.700]   that you as a grownup go yuck about, that's important.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.380]   Helping them to search out the beauty and the wonder
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:13.060]   in the world is the best way to begin teaching them
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.900]   and I'm with you, I wish somebody had said
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:23.020]   that is not extra, that is the beauty.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.180]   And you know, I was lucky enough that,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.500]   especially when my older daughter came along,
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.200]   I feel like you do, that we started homeschooling
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.020]   the minute she was born 'cause we would name everything
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.500]   and I would carry her around.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.220]   We had no close neighbors and so my daughter and I
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.280]   were each other's only companions.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.300]   My husband was there too but he was studying
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.900]   or visiting shut-ins or visiting in the hospital.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.740]   But we were each other's everything
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.100]   and I talked to her absolutely all the time.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.940]   I named everything in sight before naming
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.940]   was a core habit that I didn't do anything about.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.060]   Yes, so we would go outside and I can remember
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.420]   my mom calling one day saying,
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.460]   well, what have you been doing?
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.220]   And I said, well, we're putting on our boots
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.500]   to go outside and we're gonna play in the rain
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.020]   and she said, that's the silliest thing I've ever heard
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.500]   and I said, mom, it's warm and it's not thunder
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.300]   and it's not lightning and we have some great puddles
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.580]   in the driveway and we're gonna go and stomp the puddles
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.240]   and that was wonderful.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.340]   And so, Katie Beth, if you and I can give moms
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.660]   and dads permission to do that extra stuff
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.900]   and recognize that it's not extra,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.560]   that's actually how your children are learning,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.980]   then this will have been a good podcast.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.140]   - Yeah, my husband said something wonderful last night.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   He said, those types of activities give you the opportunity
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.180]   to interact with your environment
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.980]   through your children's eyes.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.980]   - Ooh, I like that.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.460]   - And it just struck me, what brilliance, right?
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.940]   Dads really can swoop in with a win.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.700]   So-- - That's so good.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.320]   We forget what the world looks like from their level.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.180]   - Yeah, from their perspective,
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.420]   when they get to see the tiniest bug that we step over,
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.760]   right, or a really cool pattern on a leaf
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.680]   or a gnarly twisted twig and they find those things
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.940]   so fascinating and I'm too busy as an adult
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.860]   doing adulting things, so I had to remind myself,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.900]   slow down and realize they are seeing this
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.420]   for the very first time and enjoy it
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.560]   because your first time is over.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.340]   So enjoy their first time and watch them
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.440]   in their world interacting through their eyes.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.040]   - The beauty of it, and that's attending.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.340]   We've been talking about NCC,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.040]   the five core habits for a while, and that's attending.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.900]   And little children attend.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.140]   They pay attention to what's in front of them
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.480]   way better than we do naturally.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   And I don't want to breed that out of them.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.340]   I don't want to hurry them through the world
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.900]   not giving them time to attend to all the little things
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.760]   that they see and all the differences they might perceive
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.260]   and everything that their senses could tell them.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   One person suggested to this thinking about it mom
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.980]   to go outdoors as much as possible.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   In fact, to even use the outside as the classroom
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.500]   whenever you can.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.760]   And I thought that was a very inspired suggestion.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.820]   Just getting back in touch with nature is a great thing.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.740]   - There is just something beautiful and grounding
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.740]   about a blanket on a beautiful park or a grassy yard
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.100]   under the shade of a tree and just watching,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.360]   watching the clouds in the sky, watching the bugs go past,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.740]   watching the ants marching in a line
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.260]   and the simplicity and the silence of it,
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.900]   even if it is a noisy environment that just calms your soul
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.180]   and reminds you that the Lord has made more than just you.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.600]   And he's built this world with you in mind.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.560]   And so we should enjoy it and soak it up, right?
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.300]   - Yes, that's great.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.660]   That is very, very good advice.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.460]   - All right, somebody else said,
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.420]   this is what you need to collect as you begin to homeschool.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.420]   Crayons, paint, a picnic blanket and sidewalk chalk.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.600]   What do you think about those suggestions?
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.280]   - I loved those suggestions.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.780]   Again, where were these ideas when I first got started?
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.420]   I wish I would have had a notebook in my daughter's hands
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.020]   at all times to just draw what you see.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.220]   Come home and tell daddy about your day
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.420]   when you're done with your day.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.140]   And he's getting off work and taking off his shoes
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.900]   and sitting down for dinner and tell him a story
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.560]   about what you drew and be more of a participant
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.140]   in your own world, rather than a bystander,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.700]   engaging fully with what it is that you do
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.220]   and how best to do it, but with some crayons.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.260]   - Yeah.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.420]   - With some crayons and sidewalk chalk,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.380]   draw big, draw small, just draw.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.780]   - Yes, yeah, I love that.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   It gives our kids a way to express what they're seeing,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.220]   what they're learning about,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.340]   but sometimes also what they're feeling.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.560]   I can remember watching my girls draw
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   and I could sometimes tell when they were disturbed,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.700]   when they were angry or sad about something,
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.940]   by watching the way, sometimes by what they would draw,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.480]   but watching the way that they would draw.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.420]   It just gave me a window into their emotions sometimes.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.860]   So I loved that.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   We have, at our house, we have always had a craft closet.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   And so we put, we called it plain on one side paper.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.340]   My girls were very prolific drawers and writers
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.840]   and we could not afford to keep them in paper.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.800]   So we recycled the pages that my husband created
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.100]   of sermon copies.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.880]   And so we called it plain on one side paper.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.700]   So we had a box of plain on one side paper
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.620]   and we had beads and clay and glitter,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.580]   which was strictly monitored, I must admit.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.160]   And markers and crayons and string
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.940]   and stray pieces of cardboard.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.460]   We kept all kinds of things.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.520]   And I will tell y'all, my girls are grown now.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.360]   They are married.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.020]   I have a grandson now, but we still have a craft closet
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.500]   and the girls will still call home and say,
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.080]   "In the craft closet, is there any orange yarn?
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.780]   Or do you still have plaster of Paris?
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.460]   And do we have any sun stickers?"
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.120]   And almost every time I'm able to say yes,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.060]   because the craft closet is something
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.300]   that we added to over the years.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.900]   In fact, one person said that a craft closet
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   that you keep adding to is a great idea for holiday gifts.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:46.060]   Like you could tell your in-laws or your kids' friends
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.660]   who say, "Well, what's something I could get them
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.660]   for Christmas, art supplies, craft supplies?"
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.660]   I loved having, both of my girls had their own box
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:04.480]   that had colored pencils and tape and scissors
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.840]   and a glue stick and a ruler.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.500]   One of them, one year, asked for a hole punch,
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.660]   a little hole punch, and I thought,
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.900]   "I don't know why you want that
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.220]   and it's probably gonna make a mess.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.380]   We're gonna do, I'm gonna let you have that."
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.060]   They had their own box.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.660]   So that kind of stuff was super important.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.660]   It gave them their own materials that they had charge over
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.820]   that they could use to make whatever
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.260]   their imagination dreamed up.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.140]   - Oh yeah, and just being able
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.620]   to work their little fingers, right?
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.420]   Crafting is working your brain and your fingers.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.260]   So when they're trying to sew together two pieces
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.900]   of a material for a blanket for their doll
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.100]   or they're cutting up scraps of colored paper
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.900]   to put on a montage of some sort or a collage,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.080]   it just, they're working their brains and their fingers
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.860]   and it's fun to watch my daughters crinkle
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.900]   their little faces up as they're trying
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.260]   to make something happen that they have a vision
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.820]   but they just can't figure out how to execute that vision.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.980]   And sometimes I join in on the craft time
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.940]   and sometimes I just sit back
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.060]   and it's better than watching television
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.500]   because it's unfolding, it's like live entertainment for us.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.040]   - I love the experimentation that happens and they do,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.620]   they learn a lot about cause and effect that way.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.260]   They learn try, try again if something doesn't work out
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.700]   or sometimes the thing that you envision in your mind
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.600]   comes out much differently through your fingers
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.380]   but that's a great lesson to learn
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.260]   and it is a lesson that is caught more easily than taught
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:55.900]   and so for them to have that experience, it's really good.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   And one friend and I thought this was a lovely piece
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.080]   of advice, I was kind of high strung as a new homeschooler
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.140]   and as a type A person, this friend said,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.620]   "Don't fret over the mess."
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.680]   - Yeah.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.040]   - I had a hard time with that in the beginning.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.360]   - You and me both, I felt like I wasn't doing
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.900]   a good enough job as a homemaker
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.400]   if my home didn't look like an Etsy board
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   or a Pinterest board or it didn't look magazine ready
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.580]   and I had a couple extra loads of laundry
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.660]   or a few dishes in the sink and I'll tell you what,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.100]   like when I told you I never took a nap that I regretted,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.980]   I will take a messy kitchen and especially if it comes
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.260]   with some scraps of paper and some strings
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.920]   that are from a recent craft project
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   over a well-tended two paper but board children any day
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.240]   and there's ways to incorporate education
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.700]   with not just academics but your education
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.800]   with keeping a tidy house.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.260]   I'm not saying live in utter disgust
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.560]   but there's ways to dance and sing
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   and practice your memory work or practice your times tables,
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.740]   things like that while you're putting away the clean dishes.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.420]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.780]   - Don't let chores rule your schedule.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   That's what I would tell 25-year-old Katie Beth.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.260]   - Yes, oh, I love that.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.300]   I love that and you don't want your children
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   to feel like keeping your house clean is more important
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.140]   than playing with them or exploring with them
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.060]   or reading with them or really almost anything with them.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.340]   You don't want them to feel like that your house
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.820]   is more important to you than they are.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.000]   - Indeed, yeah.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.260]   Some people were very specific
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.620]   and the things they were telling this new person
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.980]   to begin to accumulate math manipulatives,
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.300]   did you guys have manipulatives, Katie Beth?
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.200]   - Oh, and you know what, if I'm gonna be honest with you,
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.700]   I think they were used as like building blocks
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.860]   and toys more than math manipulatives.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.500]   And that was okay because they were seeing something
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.340]   and using it in a different way
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.600]   while still playing with math
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   and realizing this block of eight can only go this far.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.160]   So I'm gonna need to add these blocks of fours
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.760]   to get what I wanted with it.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.240]   But yes, we have more math minutes.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.480]   Even today, I can't let these go.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.980]   I think I'm gonna keep them until I have grandkids.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.300]   - Oh yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.920]   I still have all my Cuisinair rods
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.500]   and all my little snap blocks and the girls.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.520]   We used them.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.020]   We use them sometimes even when the girls were older
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.600]   because they helped with percentages even.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.480]   So anyway, I never regretted those things either.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.700]   Somebody even said a laminator.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.840]   Did you have a laminator?
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   - I took forever to buy a laminator and I don't know why.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.760]   I think my older daughter was in challenge A
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   before I ever bought a laminator.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.840]   And I remember after that year,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.600]   I looked at my husband and said, "What took me so long?"
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.880]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.000]   - And we still have things from that year
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.920]   that I had made and laminated that she still uses.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.000]   So it can be dangerous though.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.820]   Watch out.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.580]   You'll find yourself wanting to laminate everything.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.800]   Yes.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.380]   - That's hilarious.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.220]   That's hilarious.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.200]   Well, I am like super shocked to look up
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.720]   and realize that we've been talking
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.360]   for about 40 minutes already.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.200]   I know.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.680]   And so I actually may ask you to come back another time,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.640]   Katie Beth, if you will.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.920]   - I would be honored.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.440]   - Because one, I had several people
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.680]   who when we were asking about,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.960]   what would you tell this mom
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.880]   who is considering homeschooling
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.240]   and is not really sure if it's for them
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.460]   or how to get started?
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   I had several people say,
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.000]   "Oh man, she really needs to get hold
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   "of a Scribblers at Home resource book.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.540]   "The Scribblers at Home Recipes from Lifelong Learners."
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.940]   Somebody said, "It's a lovely book of vision
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.380]   "for moms of young ones
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.280]   "that Scribblers helps us find joy in the journey
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.860]   "and helps us find a gentle rhythm of family learning."
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   And I would say as moms and dads start off
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.080]   on this homeschool journey,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.780]   you've heard Katie Beth and I say,
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.760]   don't be too married to a routine
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.920]   and don't just bring public school home
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.720]   and make your kids sit at a desk all the time.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.720]   I tell young moms, if you pray together,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.440]   play together, read together,
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   explore together and serve together every day,
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.880]   then you've had a good homeschool day.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.780]   And that really is,
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:44.660]   that's what Scribblers encourages parents to do
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.360]   and equips mom and dads to do.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.720]   So I'd really like to talk about
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   how Scribblers can help parents pursue those ideas
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.960]   from the very beginning.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.000]   So would you come back
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.280]   and talk to me about that another time?
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.520]   - I would be more than honored, yes ma'am.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.440]   - I would be so glad to do that with you.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.460]   I wanna ask you one last question before you go.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:18.200]   Katie Beth, what makes you an everyday educator?
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.200]   - Oh, what a wonderful question.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.600]   I would say curiosity.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   I think modeling curiosity for my children
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.980]   is the starting point,
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   but then pausing and watching their curiosity take hold
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.640]   and watch their investigations
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.820]   helps to guide our homeschool more than anything else.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.820]   Just having a sense of wonder and curiosity about our world
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.740]   and about our place in the world,
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.720]   but more importantly about our relationship with God.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.060]   - I love that, I love that curiosity.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.180]   That's awesome, that's awesome.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:09.180]   Well, listeners, I hope that this has been helpful to you,
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.340]   either for you as you are beginning
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.180]   your homeschooling journey,
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.600]   or as you're thinking, oh, I wonder if I need
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.340]   to make some kind of shift.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.700]   I wonder if there's some other way
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.840]   that our family could grow together
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.580]   as we learn about God's world together,
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.340]   a way to build a family culture of learning.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.060]   I hope this has been good for you,
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.360]   and I do hope that you'll join us the next time
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.120]   as we talk a little bit about how scribblers
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.460]   can help families, not just families
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   of four to eight year olds, but families of every age
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.460]   build a culture of family learning together at home.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.580]   I also want to give you guys another heads up
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.500]   about a great event where you could perhaps find
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.660]   a homeschool mentor like Katie Beth was talking about
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.660]   earlier, our National Events Weekend for 2024
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.520]   will be here before you know it,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.460]   even though that's not till May,
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.380]   but what will really be here before you know it
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:23.380]   is the registration opening for National Events Weekend.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.040]   Registration opens soon, November the 1st.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.260]   So if you are curious about National Event Weekend
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.260]   and what you and your family could do
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.720]   if you traveled to Southern Pines
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.840]   at the beginning of May next year,
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.340]   then I would encourage you to learn more
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.340]   by going to classicalconversationsfoundation.org.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.060]   It is a great weekend.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.360]   We've got our regular national conference
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.640]   where you get to hear talks from homeschool leaders
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.380]   like Lee Bortons and Robert Bortons,
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.560]   where you will meet other homeschoolers
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.360]   and hook up perhaps with a mentor
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.980]   of your very own national commencement happens
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.080]   during that weekend.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.640]   And this year, the National Memory Master Championship
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.840]   will happen that weekend
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.980]   and you could see some of those events.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.980]   So if you're interested and you want to find out more,
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.980]   go to classicalconversationsfoundation.org.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.680]   We hope to see your family there next May,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.900]   but I for sure hope to see you or hear you
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.100]   next time on the podcast.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.300]   Katie Beth, thank you for being with me
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.280]   and I'll look forward to our next conversation.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.840]   - Thank you so much, Lisa.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.380]   - Bye guys.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.960]   (gentle music)
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.460]   (music fades)
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:51:00.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
