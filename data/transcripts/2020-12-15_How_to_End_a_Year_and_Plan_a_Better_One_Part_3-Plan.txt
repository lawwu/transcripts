[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.800]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I'm your
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   host. Today, we're going to talk about part three of how to wrap up one year and start
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.080]   a better one as we come to the end of 2020 and plan for a better year in 2021. And step
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.680]   three is simply plan. That's what we're going to be talking about in today's show. Step
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.000]   one was reflect. I talked to you about the value of simply reflecting on the year that
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.800]   was, gaining and harvesting some lessons. Then in step two, I talked about dreaming,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   tried to encourage you to never stop dreaming, to always maintain your ability to simply
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.160]   dream. Dream about a better future in any area that you would like to, any area that
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.040]   matters to you. Just simply dream. But we know, and I tried to defend this thesis, dreaming
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.200]   is important. But at the end of the day, there's a reason why we differentiate dreaming from
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   things like goal setting or dreaming from things like planning. I encourage you to dream
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.240]   with no absolute commitment to achieving your dreams. I encourage you to simply to enjoy
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.840]   the practice of dreaming and to let yourself off the hook. Recognize that you don't have
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.800]   to do everything that you think would be fun. But then there comes a time at which you want
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.120]   to start to transform those dreams into reality. I'm not personally convinced that this has
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   to be a structured program. I think a lot of people succeed to an astonishingly high
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.080]   degree even without clear structured programs in their life. I've known many people who
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   became wealthy somewhat haphazardly because they simply did the things that you do to
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.360]   become wealthy even though they didn't know that that's exactly what they were doing.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   They didn't specifically have a plan. I've seen this when people have built large businesses.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.440]   I've seen this when people have simply saved money out of even modest incomes and they
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.040]   did the things that lead to wealth even though they didn't have a clear wealth plan. Is that
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.400]   nice? Yeah, I'm glad that that happens, right? I'm glad that that works that way. It's really
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.760]   nice. But I do think you can get far better results with planning or with an informed
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.080]   position, with an informed plan that actually you're much more likely to achieve it.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   So if you're put off by the idea of planning and you want to stop with part two, dreaming,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   I think you're probably going to get some results from that. I really think you do.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.560]   I think that when you dream, you kind of naturally start to notice things. Perhaps that's the
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.440]   most powerful thing of dreaming, the old red car syndrome where you think about buying
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.840]   a red sports car and all of a sudden you see a red sports car everywhere. You go out with
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.240]   your buddy on, I don't know, you find out your buddy has bought a snow bike, right?
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   A new sport. You're like, "Hey, my buddy's bought a snow bike." And all of a sudden,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.400]   next thing you know, you're seeing snow biking stuff everywhere simply because you're tuned
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.840]   into it. And so by dreaming, I think you'll often be tuned into the things that are around
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.400]   you. But give me two people, one person that simply dreams and the other person that dreams
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.840]   and plans, and I'll put my money on the person that dreams and plans every day.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.460]   Now notice we're not yet to doing. I'm just talking about planning. And again, I want
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.880]   to make this simple for you. I want to let you off the hook. I want to recognize that
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.680]   you don't have to do everything. Realistically, if you're like me, you'll probably be
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.880]   much better at planning than at doing. I'm very good at planning. Large, grandiose plans,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.280]   all kinds of things that I can do. And I say, "Oh, I'm going to do this." And I commit
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.160]   myself to this massive to-do list. I'm not so good at actually following through. But
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.440]   what I've learned over the years is that's okay. The act of planning and the act of taking
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   a dream and transforming it into specific concrete steps, specific things I could do,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:43.040]   things I could put on a to-do list, that moves me far down the road of success.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.320]   And even if I only get 50% of the way there, I'm usually a lot better off than I would
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   have been otherwise. Let's use an example. I've been thinking a lot about my health.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.360]   I've been analyzing this year. I had a lot of success with my health and my weight this
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.040]   year. I had a lot of failure with my health and my weight this year. So I've been thinking
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.240]   about, "Okay, reflect. What worked? What didn't work? Where did things go wrong? Was it bad
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.520]   methodology? Was it me? What happened? What went wrong?" And just reflecting on that
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.160]   and making my plans for the year ahead. So let's just pretend. I'm not saying this is
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.840]   just an example. Let's just pretend that you get to the end of the year and you say, "You
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.160]   know what? This next year, I want to improve my cardiovascular fitness. So right now, I'm
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.600]   not running, but this next year, I'm going to go out and I'm going to run a 5K every
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.040]   day. I'm just going to run, what, 3.1 miles every day. I'm going to go and run this 5K
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   every day." And you lay this big plan and you map out the mileage and you say, "Okay,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   there's 365 days in this next year. Let's see. That would be 365 times 5. I'm going
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.520]   to run 1,825 kilometers in this next calendar year." And you buy some new running shoes
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.360]   and you get all ready to go. And then you start running. January 1, you're running.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.520]   January 2, you're running. January 3, you're running. January 4. But all of a sudden, you
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   start missing days. And lo and behold, running a 5K seven days a week was too much. But you
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.240]   kept on sort of doing it and you ran a 5K three days a week, sometimes four, every now
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   and then five. And at the end of the year, you're tracking your total mileage for the
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.720]   year. And all of a sudden, you find out that at the end of the year, you failed. You didn't
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:34.840]   run 1,825 kilometers. You failed spectacularly badly. You only ran 996 kilometers for that
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   year. Now, was that really a bad thing? Was that really the end of the world? See, now
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.640]   you have two choices. You can have a choice to say, "I failed. I didn't hit my goal."
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   And that's absolutely true. Or you can look at it and say, "You know what? I ran 1,000
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.840]   kilometers this year. That's stinking great. That's really awesome. And I probably ran,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.060]   I don't know, 600 kilometers more than I would have run if I had not made this plan or not
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.440]   set out this idea." And what I want to impress upon you from my hard-won years of beating
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   myself up is that there's almost never a reason to beat yourself up. Goals that you miss,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.800]   things that you fail on, the fact that you had the courage to dream and to set a plan
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.400]   and to set a goal probably means you're much closer to your goal than otherwise. And I've
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   found so many times in my life that the failures of half-accomplished plans have moved me so
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.040]   far down the road of success that in the fullness of time, I can hardly recognize where I came
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.160]   from. And so if you're somebody who naturally, like me, makes big plans, big aggressive plans,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.000]   and then often fails at those plans, no problem. It's okay. I think it is valuable to reflect
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.360]   on that. And I'm not saying we should just set that as a matter of course and always
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.440]   "I'm going to shoot for the moon, shoot for the moon, shoot for the moon," and you never
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   get off the ground, right?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.840]   There's a time in which you look down and say, "Why don't I try a more modest goal?"
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.520]   If you recognize that my actual problem is discipline and I committed myself to this
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.720]   big grandiose thing that was completely impossible, maybe it would have been more effective and
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.280]   next time I should just step back. Totally fine, right? I agree. I agree. But it's not
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:28.400]   a problem to make plans and then only finish half of them. And I'm convinced that what
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:36.640]   I see around me is not an epidemic of people who have massive goals and massive plans of
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.040]   action that are organized and then they only get half of them done. I see a lot of people
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:49.680]   who are timid, people who are shy, who pull back and they're scared to even dream, and
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.520]   then they're scared to even start planning. And they say things like, "I don't know where
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.660]   to start and I'm not sure that I could do that." Well, I'm not sure about anything.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.240]   But I know that if you're working towards something that you care about, something that's
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:09.400]   a dream, any forward action is important. And I wish, maybe someday I can honestly turn
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.680]   on a microphone and say, "I am the paragon of human discipline." Maybe someday I can
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.160]   say, "I made this commitment to myself that I was going to do X, Y, and Z and every single
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   day I did X, Y, and Z. Here's my perfect streak." Right? I filled all my activity circles on
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.640]   my Apple Watch for 365 days straight and look at me. But friends, I've never been able to
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:45.500]   say that. It just never worked for me. But I've still made massive progress because I've
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.580]   always kept pressing forward. I've never quit. And years ago when I was thinking about some
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.200]   of this stuff, for me, these ideas brought me a tremendous degree of personal comfort
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.800]   and personal confidence to say, "I'm probably not ever going to be the smartest. I'm probably
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   not ever going to be the fastest. I'm probably not ever going to be the most accomplished
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.940]   or the person with the most connections and the most ability, but I can be somebody who
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:22.320]   simply doesn't quit. And I can always start a fresh new day and I can say, 'The past is
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:29.120]   gone. Today's a new day and I'm going to start again.'" And to me, that's a character quality
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.800]   that is worth developing, to be the person who doesn't quit.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.400]   We teach our children this when we read them the story of the rabbit and the turtle, right?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   The tortoise and the hare. We teach them these things and we try to help them to understand
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.120]   and see how they can, if they just keep pressing forward and then somehow we forget about it
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.240]   ourselves. We dream a dream and we say, "Well, I've always seen that so-and-so achieved that
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.120]   dream in one year and so I'm convinced I can do it too." And then three years in, we haven't
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.920]   dreamed it yet. And that's why I talk so much when I talk about adding in time because I've
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.600]   never had, personally, I've never had a spectacular success story in anything I've done, really,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.040]   of just, "Wow, look at me. I did it overnight. I did it in one year." I've never done it.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   But yet I live a dream life. I'm so thankful for the blessings that I have every day. And
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   a lot of them have just come from day by day, pressing forward, step by step and not quitting,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:39.640]   not quitting on my dreams. I want you to not quit on your dreams.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.760]   So let's talk about how do you actually plan. I want to give you some simple things that
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.640]   will stick in your head. You're driving down the road, you're running down the road, you
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.000]   don't have a pen and paper. I'm going to give you these things and they're going to stick
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.920]   in your head so that you can do this without physically riding down some complex exercise.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.960]   And these are things, none of these are original to me. I've learned them from other people,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   stolen them without credit, but they've all been helpful to me. So let me explain.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:13.320]   Number one, the most powerful thing that I do to plan is simply this. If I can get a
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.760]   dream clear enough in my head, this is my dream. I want to buy a sailboat and sail the
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:28.860]   world for five years straight. Or this is my dream. I want to start my own internet
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:36.320]   business where my money is not tied to my time. Or this is my dream. I want to have
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   you know, 10 children. Or this is my dream. Whatever your dream is, this is my dream.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   I want to speak 10 languages. This is my dream. I want to have 10 million dollars. Doesn't
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.520]   really matter. If you can get a dream in your head, then as I said in the show on dreaming,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.540]   I'm convinced that you have the ability to achieve it. And I'm convinced that you already
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:04.400]   know enough to get started on that dream. So here's my first piece of advice. Number
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.240]   one, pretend to yourself that you have already achieved the dream. If it's something that
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.320]   you can close your eyes and see, awesome. If it's something you can write down on a
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.280]   paper, great. But just pretend to yourself and put yourself into a mental state where
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:27.680]   you think, I've already achieved this. Imagine it with as much texture and vivid imagery
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:35.480]   as you can. I've already achieved this. And then once you're in that mental space, ask
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:50.160]   yourself this question. How did I do it? What did I do to get here? If you'll do that exercise,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.280]   imagine a dream is achieved and then close your eyes and say, what did I do to get here?
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:02.800]   And imagine how you got here. Your brain will fill in the steps. Maybe your dream is, I
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.960]   imagined myself with a six pack, right? It's been a dream of mine for years, never achieved
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.920]   it. Okay. Imagine myself with a six pack. Okay. Imagine it. Okay. That's what I look
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:16.400]   like now. How did I get here? If you ask yourself that question, your brain will quickly point
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:23.920]   out all of the stuff that's personal to you. Your brain will tell you, well, you didn't
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.000]   eat these foods. You did eat those foods. You didn't live this kind of lifestyle. You
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.520]   did live that kind of lifestyle. And what's amazing about this exercise is your brain
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.600]   will fill in all of that stuff in a customized way. So for example, for me personally, if
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   I imagine that, I don't ever imagine that I got there by doing boring exercises every
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.040]   day in the gym. I find a lot of just the gym rat stuff really boring. And so my brain quickly
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:02.840]   points, shuts that down. But what I see is I see I did more sports, right? Maybe I, my
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.300]   plan as soon as I can find one open, I joined a boxing gym, right? Or I went stand up paddle
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.760]   boarding three times a week. Or I found the, you know, this, I joined a local soccer league
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.000]   or whatever the thing is, the thing that your brain puts in. Your brain automatically customizes
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.520]   it for yourself. And if you say, Joshua, did you, you know, did you get ripped abs because
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.000]   of this other thing? I say, no, because look, I failed at this, this, this, this, this,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.840]   this didn't work. That didn't work. This didn't work. That didn't work. So let me tell you
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.680]   all the things that didn't work. So none of those worked, but here are some things that
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:40.120]   might work. Or let's say it's about your money and you imagine, how did I get here? Well,
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.100]   people's brains will fill in dramatically different plans. One person's brain will fill
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.460]   in a job, right? I got a good job. I saved money and I got here because that was what
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.480]   spoke to me. Maybe I did extreme savings and that spoke to me and I achieved my five at
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.880]   45 because that was, that was the plan. And I liked the job and I didn't want to go out
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.960]   and start a business. That's just not me, but I have this good job. And if I just control
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   my expenses and find great pleasure and frugal things, I'll hit that financial independence
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   number. That's probably a really good plan for you. On the other hand, there's a guy
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.380]   out there who says he imagines his dreams, he imagines all his plans, and he can't even
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:29.580]   conceive of a job that he would do, but he conceives of a business or a brand or intellectual
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:35.620]   property or real estate or some other path. So what I've always found is my brain always
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:42.700]   fills in the path for me. And if I could just simply imagine that dream and ask myself,
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:50.780]   how did I get here? I can start to fill in some of the steps. And as human beings, we're
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.040]   good at rational thinking like this, most of us, because you can quickly see what did
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.780]   and didn't work. Imagine you're doing this exercise and you say, you know, my dream is
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:08.020]   to have a $10 million mansion on Palm Beach, a $3 million villa in Italy and, you know,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.020]   $50 million in the bank. Well, if I say, how did you get there? And you say, I got a good
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.420]   job. We quickly know that that's not going to work. And I say, no, really, no, really,
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.900]   how'd you get there? And you have the ability, even if you don't know anything technical,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.140]   even if you don't know anything with planning, you have the ability just to fill it in. Now,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:32.260]   back to what I talked about last time with dreams. In my experience, a lot of times I
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:39.580]   always fill this in by watching an example of someone else. And that leads me to suggestion
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:46.220]   number two. If you can pretend that you had the dream achieved, and if there's often somebody
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:52.300]   that you've seen who's done that dream, then you can go and ask them, how did you get there?
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.220]   And that'll often fill in a lot of stories. There's this funny thing that people do on
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.900]   social media. They go to people who drive supercars and they go up in a gas station
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.060]   and they say, you know, what do you do, excuse me, what do you do for a living? And one guy
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:15.740]   gets out of his big Mercedes and says, you know, I invest in real estate or I trade stocks
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   or I started a business. It was a great one. A couple of days ago, I saw one, there was
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.800]   a lady and I think it was one of the Arab Emirates states and he's a Muslim lady and
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.940]   she gets out of her Lamborghini and the guy says, excuse me, what do you do for a living?
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:33.100]   And she said, I'm my husband's second wife. Worked for her, right? She got herself a Lamborghini
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.900]   out of the deal. And so like, these are all paths that people have used. And so you can
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.540]   find this if you go looking for it. It's ideal if it's someone that you know that you can
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:47.420]   ask and say, hey, you did this. How can I get there? What can I do? How did you do it?
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.260]   But in today's world, you don't even have to know anybody. In today's world, you can
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.780]   find those people virtually. You find a guy like Tai Lopez, right? You find a guy like
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:07.820]   Tai Lopez. Tai has helped thousands and thousands and thousands of clueless boys become wealthy
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.000]   because he's laid out all of the stuff and says, here's how you do it. And these are
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.460]   boys who never would have had contact with somebody who was wealthy. They never would
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.380]   have had the guts to go up and ask somebody, but Tai laid it out for them in a YouTube
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.700]   video and courses and products, etc. And boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, what do you know?
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.980]   All of a sudden, now they're in that club and they never met him personally. That's
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.220]   the power of the world that we live in. You can go and you can find any community, any
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.860]   dream, you can go and find people working towards it. And you can say, how do you do
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.860]   it?
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.980]   Now, you do want to be careful that you find the right community because what I have observed
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:52.140]   from a lot of time online is that almost any different community develops its doctrine.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.940]   And that doctrine is generally inclusive of a certain set of ideas and exclusive of another
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:04.500]   set. I see this again and again in the personal finance space and all the Facebook groups
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.340]   and whatnot that I watch and watch the conversations. And you'll see somebody ask a question and
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.220]   I can predict. If I see the question without any comments, I can predict. Okay, this community,
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.740]   here are the five responses that you're going to get. And sure enough, they're all variations
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.180]   of those five things or those 10 things. And so one of the things that you should do is
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.300]   ask questions because when you have a community that develops a certain set of answers, that
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.380]   means that those are probably pretty good answers, pretty tried and true. A lot of evidence,
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:38.240]   a lot of weight, you should take those very seriously. But you should also go and look
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.340]   in other places and find other ideas. And then at the end of the day, make your own
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:51.420]   decision. But if you can find someone, either personally or virtually, who's achieved something
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:21:02.220]   that's something like your dream, then you have the ability to move closer to it by getting
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.980]   their input on how they did it. I've always found that it's helpful for me to do this
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:13.300]   even across the space of time. And that's where I personally try to spend a lot of time.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:21.540]   I don't think you need to. But let's say you're talking to some world-class person, right,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.060]   who's extraordinarily healthy. Extraordinarily healthy personally, tremendous physical health,
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.420]   they're in great shape. I'm convinced that somebody like that, who wasn't just genetics,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.380]   where, you know, I've known people who they just had dream genetics, but I'm talking about
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.140]   normal people who have to work for that. I'm convinced that you could pick those people
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   up from almost any corner of the planet, and you could drop them out into another corner
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.460]   of the planet, and they would, because they understand the principles of their life, they
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:54.300]   understand the principles of what they're doing, they would quickly figure out a way
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:00.820]   to maintain their physical health, their physical, their good shape, etc., and improve it, even
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.220]   if they were dropped in dramatically different circumstances. If you think about money, you
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.820]   could take a successful, experienced business person, pick them up from one corner of the
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.060]   planet, drop them into a totally different corner of the planet. They may not even speak
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.380]   the language, but give them a little bit of time, and the vast majority of time, they
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:25.580]   would be able to replicate their success. Why? Because you start to absorb the principles
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.300]   over time. But in the beginning stage, you don't need that. You just need some basic
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.780]   ideas of how you could move yourself closer. So, pretend that you've achieved the dream.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.540]   Get yourself in that mental space, then ask yourself, "How did I get here?" And then
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:50.260]   write down all the things that you did to get there. Make a comprehensive list. Then,
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.740]   put that list in order. I did this first, then I did that, then I did this, then I did
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:10.100]   that. And when you do that, you have the outline of a plan. And that's what you need, because
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.180]   now you could start doing things. You may still decide, "You know what? I don't want
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.420]   to do that." Totally fine. I think it's still worth planning. I've done this many times.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.260]   I'll have a dream, and I'll sit down and make a plan, and the act of making the plan satisfies
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.540]   that little itch. Helps me to say, "You know what? I don't think I really want to
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:34.580]   do that." Or, "I'm not sure that I really want to do that right now."
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:42.020]   This is last year, I was thinking about doing a cargo trailer conversion. I've become
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.060]   really interested in this. I'd like to get another RV, but I don't want to own a traditional
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.780]   RV. I just can't stand the cheapness and the junk, the way that they're built, etc.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.460]   After having owned two of them now, I thought, "You know what? Maybe I'll do a cargo trailer
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.060]   conversion." I sat down, I sketched it all out, I started putting together the plan,
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.580]   and I was super into it for a couple of weeks. Then I decided, "You know what? I don't
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.580]   love this all that much right now." I just laid it aside.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.820]   Now, that's obviously a simple thing. It's not a big dream. It's just a simple thing.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.860]   But I find that happens a lot. Scratch the itch, and then sometimes that's enough.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.740]   You can move on to something else, and you don't have to have that thing cluttering
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.660]   up your life. But if I had never sat down and sketched it out, if I'd never sat down
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.260]   and priced it out, if I'd never sat down and imagined it very clearly, it would probably
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.540]   still be there as something I really thought I wanted to do. I really thought I wanted
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.780]   to do right now. I would continue to obsess about it. It works. Take that and apply it
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.420]   to any big or small thing that you want to do.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.340]   Now, let's say that you're having trouble with this. Perhaps you say, "Joshua, it
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.700]   just doesn't work for me." Then let me make it a little bit simpler. Here's the
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:57.740]   next question. If I have a dream in mind, and I don't know how to achieve it, then
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:06.900]   let me just simply ask this. What could I do that might move me a little bit closer
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:16.380]   to that dream? What could I do today that might move me a bit closer? Hopefully, you
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.340]   hear I'm just pulling certainty back. For me, this is helpful. I don't have to be
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:28.020]   confident that this will work. I don't have to be confident that this did work. I just
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:36.380]   need something that could work. In my experience, answering that question of what could I do
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:42.620]   that might have some small possibility of moving me a little bit further ahead, then
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:51.620]   now I get some simple things that I'm probably overlooking. What could I do that might move
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:58.540]   me a bit closer to a robust physical health and a stronger body this year, make me harder
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:05.020]   to kill? I could go out my front door, turn left, and walk around the block. Seems really
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.980]   simple, but I tell you what, if I did that today, that would probably be a good thing.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:16.060]   I could do that regularly. I could do that every day. Maybe I'm scared and maybe it's
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.260]   not smart for me to go and run a 5K every day, but I could walk around the block or
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.260]   walk around a couple of blocks every day and people have literally walked off hundreds
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.980]   of pounds. People have literally walked on tremendously strong, healthy hearts and bodies
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:37.020]   just through the simple act of walking. What could I do that might move me a bit closer
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:44.460]   to my wealth goals? I don't have to promise it. What could I do? I could go to local investors
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:52.340]   meetup group. I could, I don't know, I could go and save some money, put it into my freedom
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.900]   fund jar. I could go and trim one of my bills. I could go and look at job listings for a
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:04.340]   better job. These are all things I could do and they might move me a bit closer. So list
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.220]   those things out because if you're looking for a place to start, your plan might have
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.020]   some spectacularly big leaps on it. I want to have $10 million and you start a $10 million
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.500]   business that I can sell for $10 million. Great. But what could I do today? Well, I
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.900]   could go to the library or go to Amazon and I could search for stories of people who've
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.100]   done something like that and start checking out some books. It's not guaranteed to move
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:37.380]   me there, but it might move me a bit closer. Could make a difference. I don't think you
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.940]   need anything more than what I've said so far, but in the spirit of over delivering
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.460]   as a Christmas bonus, I want to just give you a few more questions that have always
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:52.660]   been helpful for me. And they all relate around improving your skills. So here's the first
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:28:02.180]   one. What could I learn this year that might move me a little bit closer to this dream?
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.260]   What could I learn about this year that might move me a little bit closer to this dream?
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.540]   I've tried to emphasize that you probably don't need to learn more, but I find learning
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:19.140]   to be useful. If learning keeps you from action, it's not useful. But I think most of the time
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:27.140]   learning naturally leads to action. Because if you're learning and advancing in your knowledge,
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:34.460]   it's probably impossible for you not to be applying at least something. The brain is
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.700]   a learning machine and when you learn things, learn a new way of thinking, learn that there
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.900]   are new options available, learn that other people have transformed their lives. When
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.140]   you learn that stuff and you learn how they've done it, you start to just naturally, I think,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.420]   move yourself in the direction of what other people have done. So what could I learn this
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:29:01.820]   year that might move me a bit closer? And then how could I learn about it? What could
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:08.380]   I learn and how could I learn? If you can take a goal or a dream or a goal, dream a
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.180]   little bit fuzzier, goal clearer, more defined is kind of how I think about the difference
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.420]   between those things. If you could take that and you say, "What are the kinds of things
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.340]   that I could learn that would help me to achieve that?" Then just being aware of it and then
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:28.180]   starting to learn about it will give you the tools. I have a dream to be a multimillionaire.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:34.140]   What could I learn? I could learn how to manage money. I could learn how to earn money. I
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.460]   could learn how to invest money. I could learn how to save money. All these are things that
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:44.100]   you could learn. Then you ask, "How could I learn about them?" And you know the answers.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:51.300]   They're rather simple. I could start with a Google search. How to save money. Bunch
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.620]   of articles written about that. How to make more money. Bunch of articles written about
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:05.000]   that. A lot of people start there. I could start with a YouTube search. Lots of good
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.220]   stuff there. No cost for either of those resources. I could start with a podcast directory search.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:19.220]   Tremendous wealth of information. I could start with an Amazon.com search. I could go
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:24.180]   to my library and start with a search on my library website. Whatever your local library
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:30.300]   is. Do a search there. Reserve 30 books on it. And if you just do some of those things
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:36.660]   with any of your personal topics, you'll probably be quickly flooded with ideas. Flooded with
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.320]   stories of what other people have done. Flooded with ways that you could progress forward
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:53.420]   if you wanted to. So what could I learn that would move me a bit closer? Who could I meet
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:59.860]   who would help me with this? Now in our current world, I like to use this word "meet" in a
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:05.500]   very broad sense. Meaning a physical relationship where we've met one another, we've sat down,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.980]   we've broken bread together, we know each other. But you could also just simply adjust
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.820]   this and say, "Who could I surround myself with this year?" I've spoken in previous episodes
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.020]   of Radical Personal Finance about the value of social media. What I think you should do
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:30.380]   with social media is you should use your social media to surround yourself with people who
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:36.540]   are at least seeming to be like the kind of person that you want to be. We can never know,
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.900]   of course, who's behind it. But if you surround yourself with people who are seeming to be
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:45.520]   like the kind of person that you want to be, that's a powerful thing. It's a way of surrounding
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:55.380]   yourself with winners. If you fill up your Twitter feed with right-wing, left-wing commentators,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.900]   people who are always angry about the state of politics, you're going to be angry about
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.220]   the state of politics. In my opinion, it's unavoidable because that's what you're feeding
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.900]   yourself with. That's what your brain will be thinking about. On the other hand, if you
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:15.140]   surround yourself with money Twitter, people who are making money and investing money and
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.300]   have nothing but positive outlooks on the future, you can't help but be filled with
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:29.100]   money-making ideas. The people that you follow on Twitter are going to literally lead you
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:35.100]   into the future. And you can insert any other social media. When you sit down and decide
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.780]   who to follow on social media, you're creating your future whether you know it or not. So
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.140]   I would suggest to you as you end up the year, one of the very useful things that you can
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:54.060]   do is do a social media purge. Get rid of all the people that you don't want to be like.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.220]   Mute them, block them, unfollow them, de-friend them, whatever you want to do, but get rid
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:02.700]   of the people that you don't want to be like and fill your phone with the people that you
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.620]   do want to be like. I've got some advanced strategies for these. Maybe I'll save them
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.580]   for a standalone show at some point in time. But it's one of the most powerful things you
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:21.180]   can do is use these platforms to surround yourself with what you want to be like. Maybe
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:27.220]   just start fresh. I've done this. I have multiple accounts across the board, but maybe your
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.860]   current Instagram is full of personal friends. Fine, just add another one and make this your
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.500]   dream life and just follow people that you admire. Start a new Twitter profile. Start
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.340]   a new YouTube profile so you can retrain the algorithm and train all your algorithms to
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:53.060]   simply feed you content that helps you to surround yourself with people who encourage
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:34:02.220]   you, inspire you, motivate you, etc. It doesn't have to be what other people would admire.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:07.500]   It can be you personally and it should be you personally. That's one of the things that's
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:15.460]   I think most powerful. Just a personal example. I just found this guy recently. I wish I knew
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.620]   his name. I can't remember his handle, but I found him on Instagram. He's a teenager.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:26.180]   He's got cerebral palsy and pretty severe case. Although he's not wheelchair bound,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:31.980]   he walks awkwardly. But he posts a lot of pictures of him in the gym. He's in the gym
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:38.660]   weightlifting. I find him so inspiring. Here's a teenage boy. He's got cerebral palsy. He's
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.940]   got physical challenges that I've never in my life faced. As he puts his head on a swivel,
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.940]   he's got his head shaking back, shaking back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.100]   I'm always scared he's going to fall down, but there he goes doing his squats, doing
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.820]   his deadlifts, doing his exercises. He can't stop moving. He can't stop the effects of
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.540]   cerebral palsy. But every time I see him, a tear comes to my eye and I'm like, "That's
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.100]   the kind of guy that I want to be, right? I want to be someone who when I'm faced with
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:09.740]   massive problems and massive obstacles and massive disadvantages, I want to be the guy
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.460]   that presses forward and says, 'Let me use what I've got and got stronger.'" What excuse
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:20.220]   do I have for not being in the gym if this guy can be there?
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   Now you may find your own thing. I'm just trying to share a little bit of me, but I
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:28.420]   don't find bodybuilders and people who... I don't find perfect people particularly inspiring.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:36.260]   I find flawed people. I find people who... failures of people who keep pressing forward.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.300]   For me, I find those people inspiring. And so when I fill my social media feeds with
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:48.100]   those kinds of people, it keeps me motivated to press forward.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:55.320]   So who could I meet this next year? And now let's move on to physical meeting. Literally,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.120]   who could I meet this next year? Not just surround myself with, but who could I meet?
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.900]   If we know that our lives generally reflect the lives of the people that we spend the
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.400]   most... the people that we spend the most time with, then one of the ways that we can
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.720]   really automatically change our lives is by surrounding ourselves with different people.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.640]   And step one is simply meeting somebody. So do you have a list of people that you would
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.480]   like to meet? People that encourage you, that inspire you, people that you look up to, people
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.560]   that you would like to be like? Cultivate that list and then start doing things to move
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:39.120]   yourself in that direction. Could be the neighbor two roads down that you find out about and
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.480]   you think you admire him. Could be some rich, famous, well-known person in your industry
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:50.400]   that if you just met them at a conference or something like that would make a big difference.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.280]   Who could you meet this next year? These kinds of questions could go on and on and I'm going
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:05.960]   to wrap up. I simply want you to think about what could I do? And those are the two thought
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.360]   experiments for you to keep in your mind. If you have a dream, picture that dream and
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.920]   ask yourself, what did I do? And write down everything that comes to your mind. What did
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.080]   I do to accomplish this? Put yourself, imagine yourself in that future state and say, what
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:30.840]   did I do that led me to this path? How did I meet this woman of my dreams? How did I
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:37.720]   build this $10 million company? How did I do it? And if that's a productive thinking
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:47.000]   exercise for you, use it. If you're intimidated by even that, then ask yourself this, what
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:56.280]   could I do that might, just might, move me a bit closer in the direction of where I want
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:06.720]   to go? Now, I'm not going to do the show right now on step four, which is simply start doing.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.360]   And I'm not going to do it primarily because in one hour and 45 minutes, I'm going to go
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.640]   get on an airplane with my family and fly home for the holidays. We're looking forward
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:23.400]   to that. I don't have the time to finish it right now. But honestly, I don't know if it's
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.760]   really all that important that I even finish it by talking about doing it. Because at the
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.120]   end of the day, we all know that we've got to do it. It's not enough to just write stuff
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.160]   down unless it leads to action. But I think that process is pretty well automatic, at
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.080]   least in my experience. I've experienced that just the process of dreaming about something
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:53.800]   and then planning how I could do it pretty well automatically leads me to some action.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.040]   Is it better if you make a plan and put all the actions down and then start systematically
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.680]   creating a feedback system and a system of accountability where you start doing all of
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:09.280]   the things? Probably so. But I don't want to scare you with that right now, because
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:15.120]   I never seem to follow through on all of the things. But you do need to start doing, start
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:22.040]   taking action, start taking action. And so resolve that if you've got some stuff that
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:28.640]   you could do that might help you to move in the direction of your dreams, just resolve
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.520]   that you're going to be the kind of person who does the things that might make a difference
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.720]   in your life. Looking for a good New Year's resolution, that would probably be a good
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:47.180]   one. I resolve that I will be the kind of person who does the things that might lead
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:53.820]   me in the direction of my dreams. Now, if you're ready for a more robust commitment
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.080]   than that, go for it. But at the very least, I think that would be a good place to start.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.360]   I want to close out today with simply this. Thank you for listening to Radical Personal
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.520]   Finance during this year. In some ways, it has been a very, very difficult year for me
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.160]   personally and it has certainly been a memorable year for all of us. A lot of things happening
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:21.600]   in this year. And I continue to be filled with concern. In many ways, I have a heavy
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.080]   heart. There's so many businesses around the world really struggling right now. So
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.640]   many people being shut down by heavy-handed government decrees and things like that. That
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:38.560]   stuff is rather obvious. And so, it's been a - and in my life, we've faced some significant
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.180]   challenges this year and I'm sure that you have too. If all of us sat down and started
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.800]   telling our stories, we could probably put all of each other in tears. But on the other
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.640]   hand, it's also been a very beautiful year. It's been a great year. I'm very happy with
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:57.160]   this past year in my life personally, the lives of my family, etc. And I'm excited about
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:05.740]   the future. And I just want to say that let - as we go into Christmas season and New Year's
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:13.100]   and whatnot, let these things just enjoy. Enjoy the turning of the seasons. Enjoy the
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:23.000]   chance to - enjoy the chance to get a fresh start. We talk about New Year's resolutions
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:31.300]   because it's a time of year in which we understand more vigorously on an emotional level that
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.280]   the past is gone and that it can't be changed. We understand that, hey, the past is the past
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.560]   and I can't change it, but it's a brand new year and it's a fresh start. And you're
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.520]   going to see a wealth of articles talking about, oh, New Year's resolutions don't work.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:53.640]   It's basically become very hip and expected to dump on New Year's resolutions now. I'm
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:59.220]   sure that trend will change soon enough. But I love New Year's resolutions. I love dreaming
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.240]   about the year ahead. And if you - if that works for you, go for it. If it doesn't work
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.880]   for you, you know, don't do it. But I love - I love the new year. It's always exciting.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.680]   It gives me a chance to dream and say, what can I do? And I got thrown off on a lot of
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:18.280]   stuff. I got thrown off on a lot of my dreams this past year. But it's a brand new year
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   and I'm going to keep on working and you are a major part of that and I'm so grateful for
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:32.740]   your being here. I wish you a peaceful and a joy-filled Christmas and a very, very happy
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:41.940]   new year. I'll be back with you on Monday, January 11, 2021. Monday, January 11, 2021.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.640]   Have a great day.
