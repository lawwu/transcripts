[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   What should we think of flashy pastors?
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.240]   That's the question this Monday morning from a listener named Emily. Emily writes in to ask this, Pastor John,
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.280]   thank you for sharing your wisdom with us all on this podcast.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:25.040]   Recently social media accounts have surfaced and gained quite a bit of attention which show numerous well-known pastors wearing
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.600]   extremely expensive and flashy clothes and
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.480]   shoes and watches, etc.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.040]   These accounts have raised controversy about whether these leaders are
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.280]   justified in doing this. Many say that they should be able to use the money they make however they please or
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.080]   that these items are gifts, but others are offended by their luxurious
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.360]   lifestyles and argue that regardless of how a pastor obtains these things,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.760]   they should still be demonstrating humility and reverence towards their congregations and toward those who are struggling to simply survive.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.120]   Many think their lavish lifestyles discredit Christ.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.600]   1 Peter 3:3 seems to allude to this issue, but I'm curious Pastor John,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.240]   what other text of Scripture speak to this and where do you stand on it all?
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   Well, there's no question where I sympathize here.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.000]   I mean my sympathies have been made clear over the years with regard to
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.120]   simplicity and wartime lifestyle.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   I get angry when I see pastors flaunting their luxury as if it were a compelling
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.280]   testimony that Jesus is more satisfying than what money can buy. Baloney. It's appalling.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.840]   So let me say loud and clear right off the bat,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.320]   nobody is
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.040]   drawn to Jesus as the spiritual, saving,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.000]   satisfying treasure of their souls.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.080]   By the luxurious lifestyle of those who supposedly preach the Word. Nobody.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   What people are drawn to in preachers who make much of their luxury is the hope of luxury.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.480]   That's what they're drawn to, the hope of luxury. This is not Christianity.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.160]   Christianity is to be drawn to a crucified and risen Savior whose greatness and beauty and worth in
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.600]   himself are so admirable and
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   so satisfying
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.840]   that the heart cries out with the psalmist, Psalm 63, "The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life."
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.640]   Yes, and everything in this life. You cannot commend
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.600]   the truth that Jesus is better than money
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.560]   by giving the impression that you live for money. A decisive turn happened in redemptive history with the coming of Jesus
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   that makes it invalid
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.160]   to use the lavish temple of the Old Testament,
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.200]   the priestly robes, the gold-plated utensils, the lavish curtains as a model for
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.480]   contemporary church buildings or Christian living. It's invalid. The Old Testament was by and large a come-see religion.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.440]   Queen of Sheba was breathless at the wealth of Solomon.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480]   But the New Testament is largely a go-tell
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   religion.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.960]   Unlike the Old Testament, the Christian Church has no temple,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.800]   no geographic center like Jerusalem, no ethnic identity like Jewishness, no
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.440]   theocentric civil structure that puts people to death for impieties.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.000]   We are a pilgrim people, exiles, refugees,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.800]   scattered among the nations with the grand mission given by the Lord Jesus to make disciples of all the peoples of the world.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   And we're not done with that.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.960]   This
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.440]   revolutionizes the way we think about money and use our resources. It all tends toward
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.320]   the simplicity of wartime living where we strategize to glorify God by finishing the Great Commission and
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.120]   evangelizing our cities and showing love to our neighbors.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   The New Testament is relentless.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   It's amazing. Just read it.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.600]   It is relentless in pushing us toward simplicity and economy for the sake of Christ and away from luxury and away from
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.040]   affluence and finery.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.200]   For example, Luke 6 20, "Blessed are you poor,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.560]   for yours is the kingdom of heaven. Woe to you rich, for you have received your consolation." Luke 8 14,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.600]   "They are choked by the riches and pleasures of life." Luke 9 58, "The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.000]   Luke 12 15, "A person's life does not consist in the possessions that he has."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.520]   Matthew 6 19,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.200]   "Don't lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven." Matthew 6 25,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   "Don't be anxious about your life,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.200]   what you shall eat or what you should drink or your body, what you should put on is not life more than food and the
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.680]   body more than clothing."
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.720]   Luke 12 31, "Seek the kingdom. These other things will be added."
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:23.040]   Luke 12 33, "Sell your possessions, give alms, provide yourselves with purses in heaven." Luke 14 33,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.800]   "Whoever does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple." Luke 18 24,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.360]   "How hard it will be for those who have riches to get into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   James 2 5, "Has not God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith?"
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.800]   That's the refrain over and over and over throughout the whole New Testament and
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.440]   even in those places, and there are only a few, where wealthy Christians are
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:58.120]   directly addressed. Like 1 Timothy 6 17, the message is, "Be thankful to God for all of your
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.520]   legitimate enjoyments and
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   be filled with good deeds
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.800]   for those who have greater need than you." In other words, there's just no
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.720]   encouragement anywhere in the New Testament that we should accumulate and accumulate or
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.800]   increase the symbols of our wealth,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   by what we wear, what we drive, where we live. The man who builds bigger barns
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.360]   for what he doesn't need is a fool. He's a fool, Jesus says.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   The gist is this, "Be content with a relatively simple lifestyle."
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.880]   And I say relatively because I know that virtually all Americans are rich, period, because the rest of the world,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720]   two-thirds of the world, lives so close to the edge.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:55.840]   So I'm talking a relatively simple lifestyle, "And make as much money as you please and give what you don't need
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   for the sake of the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel and the care of the suffering."
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.080]   Most of the New Testament
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.600]   circles around, revolves around, three main concerns when it comes to teaching on money. One,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.840]   how to display the value of Christ and the gospel.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.560]   Two, how to meet the needs of the lost and the suffering. Three, how to avoid the soul-destroying
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.360]   dangers of wealth. So just a word about each of those.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   How to display the value of Christ and the gospel.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.160]   Paul said in Philippians 3, "I count everything as loss
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:41.040]   because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." He wanted
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.440]   to live in such a way as to show that his heart was satisfied with Christ and
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   not
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.400]   captured by the idol of greed.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   So he worked with his hands
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.400]   rather than give any impression that he was fleecing the churches.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.560]   1 Thessalonians 2, 5, "We did not come to you with any pretext for greed."
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.680]   We weren't using our ministry as a cover-up for our love of money.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.840]   To the elders in Ephesus, he said, "I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. You know that.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   I worked late at night to keep from being a burden on anybody." To the Corinthians,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   he said, "We are not like so many
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.080]   peddlers of God's Word." To Timothy, he said, "If we have food and clothing,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.200]   we will be content." And then he just laid it down for all the pastors.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.240]   They must not be lovers of money. 1 Timothy 3, 3. Now the point of all those words
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   was to remove
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.800]   every obstacle
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.320]   from believing the gospel and to show the superior worth of Christ over all earthly possessions and to
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.560]   set an example for the believers of
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.440]   self-denial and a happy embrace of
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:11.080]   sacrifice for the sake of love. Because as Jesus said, "It is more blessed,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:18.400]   it is more blessed to give than to receive." And anybody who's been walking with Jesus for any amount of time knows
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.200]   you're gonna be happier and sleep better at night the more generous you are, the less selfish you are.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.560]   The second main concern of the New Testament and
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   possessions is how to meet the needs of the lost and the suffering.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:40.600]   Jesus said, "Sell your possessions, give to the needy, provide yourselves with money bags that don't grow old,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.880]   a treasure in the heavens."
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:51.280]   That's Luke 12, 33. Paul said, "Let the thief no longer steal, but let him labor doing honest work with his hands
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.560]   that he may have
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:00.880]   something to share with those in need." Isn't that amazing? In other words, don't steal and
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.600]   don't just work to have.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.120]   Work to have to give.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.480]   Just the three levels, right? You can steal, you can work to have, you can work to have to give. And he says, "Go there, Christians.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   Go there. Live there. Live to give."
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:24.000]   Christians are going to inherit the entire world and everything in it. Oh my goodness.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.080]   We could spend a whole session on that. Yeah. 1 Corinthians 3.21. You have everything, Christian.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.160]   You don't need to grasp for it now. You're gonna get it in a vapor's breath.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.800]   This little world is gonna be over. The present world is
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   lost without the gospel.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.040]   Millions are suffering. This is the age for radical generosity and sacrifice,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.080]   not the age for luxurious living.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:59.560]   Finally, number three, that last concern with possessions is how to avoid the soul-destroying
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.360]   dangers of wealth.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.760]   Jesus says it's hard for the rich.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.120]   To enter the kingdom of God. Luke 18.24.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.800]   Paul said, "Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction." Oh
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.160]   goodness, how clear can Jesus and Paul be about the dangers of
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   accumulation and accumulation? So I say it again. It is appalling
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.800]   that those who claim to be faithful ministers of the Word of God
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.280]   would flaunt their luxuries. Just appalling. It turns Christ
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.040]   from a beautiful,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.520]   all-satisfying Savior into a broker
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.680]   who gives us what we really want,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.280]   money and comfort.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.040]   Yeah, nothing but a broker of money and comfort. Thank you, Pastor John. As
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.280]   Paul says, "For we are not like so many peddlers of God's Word."
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.200]   You mentioned this text, that's 2 Corinthians 2.17.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.280]   That section, that whole section of 2 Corinthians 2 verses 12 to 17 is so rich when it comes to
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.360]   ministry. And on Wednesday, we're gonna return to it and ask, "Am I called to ministry? Has God called you to the ministry?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   Is he calling you to the ministry?"
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   Well, there are five tests in that text to discern a calling to ministry.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.800]   We'll see them next time on
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.280]   Wednesday. I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
