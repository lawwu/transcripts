[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Good Monday morning to you.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.360]   Maybe you're listening on your way to class or to work.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.120]   Mondays for many of us is a day to reenter the complexities of life as God's redeemed
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.280]   children living out our faith in a world that is hostile to our Heavenly Father.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.600]   And that raises questions like whether the world should like us or whether the world
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.280]   should hate us.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.960]   Which result shows us to be most faithful to our God?
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.480]   It's a huge question, not one for today, it's a question for another day.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.920]   We'll get to it in two Fridays.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.980]   Today's question, Pastor John, is about the sinfully vile in this world.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.960]   Should we despise them or should we love them?
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.620]   Here's the question.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.200]   My name is Parker, I'm 14.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.820]   Psalm 15, verse 4 says, speaking of a blameless man, that in their eyes a vile person is despised.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.480]   How can we both despise the vile and yet also love our enemies?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.760]   And the same question comes from a listener named Peter.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   Hello to you, Pastor John.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.580]   David says in Psalm 15, verses 1, 2, and 4, "Oh Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent?
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.080]   Who shall dwell on your holy hill?
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:27.480]   He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, in whose eyes a vile person is despised."
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.080]   But Jesus says in Matthew 5, verse 44, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.560]   you."
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.440]   These categories of one, vile people, and two, enemies and persecutors, are not entirely
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.960]   overlapping, but I think it's safe to say that there's at least some overlap between
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   them.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.720]   I think David had his enemies in mind in Psalm 15 when he was talking about the vile people.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   Do you agree?
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   And if you do, how are we to simultaneously despise and love the sinfully vile?
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.280]   The short answer is that it is indeed possible to love someone you despise.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:18.540]   In fact, it is not just possible but necessary, because the Psalm says that one of the marks
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.480]   of the person who dwells with God, enjoys God's fellowship, is that in his eyes a vile
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.040]   person is despised.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   That's a mark of being welcomed into God's favor.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.040]   In fact, we don't even need to jump from the Psalm to Jesus in order to see what love requires
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.520]   toward a vile person.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.560]   Let me read Psalm 15, because the whole thing is remarkable in this regard, and I'll just
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.000]   pause and mark the key parts as we go along.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.080]   "O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent?"
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   That's the question.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.040]   Who shall enjoy fellowship with God?
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.160]   "Who shall dwell on your holy hill?"
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.200]   In other words, what are the marks of a person who can enjoy the presence and the fellowship
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   of God?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.360]   And here comes the answer.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.320]   Verse 2, "He who walks blamelessly and does what is right."
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.600]   So he's not free.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.260]   This person who qualifies to be with God is not free to call just anything right.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.120]   He does what is right, namely what God calls right.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.280]   Now, continuing, "And he speaks truth in his heart," verse 3, "who does not slander with
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.480]   his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor."
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.920]   Now that's very crucial, because it comes just before the word about despising.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.560]   Paul said in Romans 13.10, "Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   of the law."
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.240]   So the psalmist is saying, when he says, "does no evil to his neighbor," I must love my
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   neighbor.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.440]   I may not wrong him.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.400]   And then the text continues, "Nor takes up a reproach against his friend," verse 4, "in
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.760]   whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord, who swears
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.840]   to his own hurt and does not change."
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.600]   That means he keeps his promises even when it hurts him.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.040]   "Who does not put out his money at interest," which means he doesn't take advantage of anyone
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.600]   financially, "and does not take a bribe against the innocent," so he won't let himself be
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.560]   lured by money to treat anyone unjustly.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   And then, "He who does these things shall never be moved," end of Psalm.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.480]   So what do we make of this?
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:17.360]   Here's David, a psalm of David, "The Man After God's Own Heart," 1 Samuel 13, 14, and in
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.160]   it he says that the person who can dwell with God and enjoy God's fellowship, one, does
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.840]   what is right, two, does not slander anyone, three, does no evil to his neighbor, four,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.160]   doesn't charge interest to gouge anyone, five, doesn't let bribery, pervert justice in his
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160]   hands.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.760]   In other words, this is not a careless moment for David in which he's on some kind of hate
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.920]   tirade against evil doers.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.640]   This is a thoughtful listing of beautiful traits of the person God delights to have
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.600]   near him.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:05.680]   And right after saying, "He does no evil to his neighbor," one phrase later he says, "In
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:13.640]   this godly man's eyes, a vile person is despised, and one who fears the Lord is honored."
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   So, if we take Paul's definition of love from Romans 13, 10, "Love does no wrong to a neighbor,"
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:33.960]   then what David is saying is the man whom God welcomes loves his neighbor and despises
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.080]   him if he's vile.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.680]   Notice the two halves of verse 4.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.920]   We call this kind of poetic parallelism antithetical.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.120]   That means the two halves express opposites.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.200]   So here's what he says in verse 4.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:07:00.040]   "In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors," which is the opposite of
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.760]   despised, "those who fear the Lord," which is the opposite of vile.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:16.680]   What David is drawing attention to in the godly person's heart is not how they act,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.840]   not how they treat people.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.520]   That's not the point of verse 4.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   That's the point of verse 3.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.480]   You do no wrong to a neighbor.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:32.560]   But what they feel about the character of a person, what they admire in their hearts
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:43.080]   or don't admire, what they praise, glorify, honor, the godly person does not glorify the
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   vile person.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.420]   He glorifies the one who fears the Lord.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:56.680]   The godly person does not admire or venerate or want to be like the vile person.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.320]   He admires, he wants to be near and be like the person who fears the Lord.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:11.920]   In other words, to despise in Psalm 15 does not mean you desire to destroy a person or
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.560]   to see a person come to ruin.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:24.600]   To despise means you regard the person's character, not their body, their character as ugly, dishonorable,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.400]   shameful, disgraceful, unworthy of praise.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.160]   There are people like that, and it would be ungodly not to despise them.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:43.440]   And David is saying, if you have the kind of heart that enjoys being around vile people
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.660]   who don't fear God, if you admire and esteem vile people, you're not fit for the presence
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   of God.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.720]   That's what he's saying.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.160]   What David meant and what Jesus meant by loving our neighbor is not that we should admire
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.640]   their wickedness.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.000]   We should despise their wickedness.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.920]   And I know there's someone who's saying, "You shouldn't say it like that.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.760]   If you think I should be saying here, 'Despise the sin and not the sinner,'" that's what
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.040]   some of you are thinking.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   That would be true if despising meant feeling desires for their ruin.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.240]   But the problem with that traditional way of expressing love, love for the sinner, not
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.600]   the sin, is that it is precisely the person who is vile.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.140]   That's what it says.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.040]   And there are vile people.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.840]   The vileness is not an alien intruder into a good person.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.420]   Sin is not the only thing that's vile.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.460]   People are vile.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.960]   People produce sin.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   Sins don't produce people.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.720]   Evil comes from the heart, Jesus said.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   It doesn't come from outside and contaminate the innocent heart.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   It's people who will be judged for being vile, not just their vileness.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.640]   Vileness doesn't go to hell, people go to hell.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.840]   So let me say it again.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:18.720]   What David meant and what Jesus meant by loving our neighbor is not that we admire their wickedness.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.840]   We should despise their wickedness, and that includes despising the kind of person that
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.960]   loves and does wickedness.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.840]   And we should love them and be willing to lay down our lives for them.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:42.400]   Jesus prayed on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing."
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.000]   Luke 23, 34.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.840]   He was praying for people whom just days before he had said were fools, whitewashed tombs,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:05.280]   full of wickedness and greed, and who on Pentecost, 50 days later, would be saved.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.960]   His prayer would be answered.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.320]   3,000 came to Jesus, including many priests.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:21.440]   Now, besides Jesus himself, the clearest example in the New Testament of loving someone we
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.920]   despise is the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.240]   Jews and Samaritans are chosen in this parable because they despised each other.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.400]   Look at John 4, 9 and numerous other texts.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   And so Jesus illustrated what neighbor love involves by portraying a Samaritan stopping
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.240]   to help a wounded Jew.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:59.840]   There's not a word in this parable about his liking him or admiring him as a Jew, only
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:08.960]   that he had compassion on him in his misery and took practical steps to relieve his suffering.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:19.740]   So my answer to Parker and Peter's question is that it is a godly trait to feel that vileness
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.580]   is repulsive and despicable.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.220]   To admire it would be sin.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.720]   Admiration belongs to the fear of the Lord.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.880]   Despising belongs to despicable vileness.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:45.040]   But the radical call on our lives as Christians is to love even those we despise and join
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.280]   Jesus in saying, "Father, forgive them.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.080]   They don't know what they're doing."
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.720]   And thank you, Peter and Parker, for the questions.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.960]   I know some of you are wondering if Peter and Parker are real names.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.200]   Your spidey sense is up.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.720]   But yes, two different listeners.
