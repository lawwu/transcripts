[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Friends, we are beginning again.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.840]   Please take your seats.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.800]   And I have the joy of introducing to you Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones' grandson, Jonathan Catherwood,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   who's with us today.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.360]   Jonathan, over on my left, thank you so much for being here.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   Thank you.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   I appreciate it.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   Jonathan, can you tell us what we just saw a bit of there?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   Yeah, we're very excited.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.760]   Matt Robinson, a documentary filmmaker, is making a biographical film about my grandfather
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.240]   that should be coming out next year, interviewing Ian Murray and others who had known him, filming
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.840]   in England and Cambridge, interviewing family members.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.040]   But the main purpose of it is to understand Martin Lloyd-Jones, the man behind the sermons.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.840]   We're very excited about it and coming out in 2015.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.160]   Wonderful.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.760]   And Jonathan, also, the Lloyd-Jones Recording Trust.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.240]   Can you just tell us briefly, for people who maybe have seen a Lloyd-Jones book but don't
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.600]   know much else about how they can actually listen to Martin Lloyd-Jones, what his sermons
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   were like.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   Can you help us with that?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.040]   Yes, we have a website called mljtrust.org, and on that website we have 1,600 sermons
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   by Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.080]   They're completely free to download or you can play them on the site.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.560]   It has all his major series on Ephesians, on Romans, on Acts, the Gospel of John, but
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.800]   many, many others, including lectures to the medical fellowships and tributes to him by
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   others.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.680]   mljtrust.org, it's completely free.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   We invite you to come back once, twice, build your own libraries and do as you will with
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   them.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.840]   Ian, so many of the things…
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.440]   Sorry, and then this is Ian Murray right here next to Jonathan Catherwood.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.080]   It's wonderful to have Ian with us.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.800]   Thank you, brother, for being here.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.480]   So many of us are indebted to the Lord for your books that you've written and even
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   the many more books that you've published with Banner of Truth.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.640]   Thank you so much, brother, for your work for the Lord's kingdom.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   We're in America.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.600]   We can applaud and say thank you.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.440]   Ian, one of the things that I know from talking to you over the years that you think people
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.520]   misunderstand about Martin Lloyd-Jones is they misunderstand how much of his ministry
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.880]   really was evangelistic.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.280]   We know him through these great sets, these great series that Jonathan just mentioned,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   and those are usually a series he preached at church on Sunday, but in fact, Dr. Lloyd-Jones
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.040]   spent much of his ministry practically preaching evangelistic sermons, most of which aren't
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520]   recorded and haven't been published.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   Well, his practice was to preach evangelistically every Sunday night, but then during the week,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   generally on a Tuesday and a Wednesday night, he'd be traveling in different parts of
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.120]   England and Wales and sometimes Scotland, and these would nearly always be evangelistic
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.360]   sermons.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.200]   So they were never taken down and circulated.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.400]   Those tapes exist here and there.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.160]   Some of the American ones were recently published by Crossway, and we're delighted that that's
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   happened.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.800]   But by and large, most of the published sermons, as you know, are expository sermons intended
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.400]   for Christians, and that has given the impression that he was principally a teacher and an expositor,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.660]   whereas Mrs. Lloyd-Jones, his wife, said, "No one will understand my husband, who does
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.200]   not know that he was first of all a man of prayer and then an evangelist."
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   So I know that Banner published the Old Testament evangelistic sermons.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   Yes, yes.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.720]   We have published a few.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.760]   Jonathan, what was he like as a grandfather?
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.840]   He was the exact opposite from the book covers that you see.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   Exactly.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   That's the…
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.680]   You'll be getting this book in the zero dollar bookstore, Ian's new biography of Lloyd-Jones.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.400]   I have had something of an argument with Jonathan's mother over these book jackets, because it's
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.720]   quite true.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   He hated having his photograph taken.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.160]   He was a very modest and humble man.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.400]   He always looked glowering.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.860]   As a grandfather, he was the sweetest, most gentle man, endlessly patient.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.800]   And when we used to run around into the vestry to see him at Westminster Chapel after a service,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.600]   people thought we were going in there for instruction from the great theologian.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   He used to hide the little minis Cadbury's chocolates all through his vestry for his
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.280]   grandchildren to find.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.400]   And he was always there for us if we needed that help, but his primary role in the home
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.080]   was as a father and a grandfather, and we loved him for it.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.920]   But I have to add just a brief footnote.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   There's a great line that you put in here in this wonderful book.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.760]   In the last four months of his life, you say he was sitting in his chair, but always in
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   his suit, which looked like it belonged to someone else.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.320]   Yes.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.160]   His cancer was far advanced, and his clothes were hanging on him.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.280]   But it was quite amusing, really, that Lady Catherwood wasn't at all pleased with these
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.160]   pictures, and it's because he was in person so kind and approachable, but that's how we
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.560]   saw him in public.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.760]   That was how we remembered him from the public view, whereas the family had quite a difference.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.800]   Jim Packer tells the amusing anecdote that I think I've heard you tell too of being at
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.500]   the Westminster Fellowship for Ministers and Lloyd-Jones commenting on the ladies that
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:05.560]   are coming.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.880]   This was at an early Puritan conference.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.280]   The Puritan conference started in 1950, and there were virtually no ladies there.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   There was no rule about it, but they just didn't come.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   And at one of the early conferences, Lloyd-Jones said to Packer, "These two ladies here," I
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.800]   can't give you exact words, but who are they?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.920]   Where have they come from?
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.320]   And one of them was Jim Packer's future wife, so Jim could speak for her.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   Yeah, well, I think, as I remember Jim telling it, Lloyd-Jones just says something to him
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840]   like, "Wonder what they're doing here?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   Probably looking for a husband."
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.920]   And Jim says, "Well, in fact, I'm engaged to one."
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.240]   And the doctor responds, "Right, so I was right about one, now what about the other?"
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.720]   So he had a very quick wit.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.680]   I want to add just a note about what you said about his humility, and that's just to help
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   drive the men to read this book.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.640]   You have another wonderful line in there that toward the end of his life when you were interviewing
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.920]   him for the original two-volume biography, you said he talked about his life as if he
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.800]   were an onlooker looking at the life of someone else.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   Yes, and could I just add on the point of his humility, I'm impressed with Professor
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   F.F.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   Bruce because Bruce was publicly criticized by Lloyd-Jones for associating with men who
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   were far from evangelical, but it was Bruce who paid a very fine tribute to Lloyd-Jones.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.040]   The dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, W.R.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.200]   Matthews, had heard Lloyd-Jones speak and said it was extraordinarily bad, and it was
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.080]   bad for this reason, Matthews was insinuating.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:11.440]   The man is so arrogant, and it was Bruce who stood up and said, "He's not arrogant.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.800]   His confidence is in the Word of God.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.640]   He's a most humble man."
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.280]   And coming from Bruce as a man who himself had been somewhat chastised by Lloyd-Jones,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.280]   impressive.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   Ian, what was it like to be his assistant?
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.720]   You actually worked in ministry with him in the 1950s.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.400]   I was afraid you'd ask me this question.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.440]   I'm often asked it, and you'd think I'd be prepared, but I never am.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   It's very hard to say.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.720]   You know, instead of Whitfield, he was like a lion in the pulpit and a lamb out of it,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.400]   and that was Lloyd-Jones.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.200]   Out of the pulpit, he was very approachable, very easy to speak to.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.000]   Children could easily approach him.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.960]   He treated us with great kindness and patience and sometimes long-suffering.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.520]   It's said that when Whitfield grew old, he had little time for young men because they'd
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.680]   let him down so much, and he didn't spend much time with them.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.080]   Lloyd-Jones wasn't like that.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   He was let down by young people.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.360]   There's no doubt about that, but he gave himself to them, and he did that right up
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   until the end.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   John, you said that in your early ministry, you were particularly influenced by Lloyd-Jones.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.000]   Do you want to tell us about that?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You didn't know him personally.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.680]   I did not know him, but at the kind invitation of the Lloyd-Jones Trust, Grace to You partnered
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.880]   with you for many, many, many years.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.680]   And it was a great joy to me because you didn't know at the time all that the doctor meant
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.480]   to me.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.680]   There were probably two things I would say.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.440]   Number one was reading the two-volume biography and finding out what a kindred spirit he was
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.640]   to me, and I could break that down into categories.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.960]   He had the same view essentially of preaching that I've had, and I needed to find a hero
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.720]   that I could follow.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.960]   And that was that exposition had to be relentlessly doctrinal.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.480]   And you have a statement that Lloyd-Jones during his time as an expositor with a doctrinal
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.800]   emphasis was alone in the UK.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   Pretty much, yes.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.280]   And that would have been true here, but I was convinced that the whole point of Bible
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.560]   exposition was so that the doctrine would emerge, and all preaching had to be doctrinal.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.840]   That was a huge influence to me.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.760]   Unscheduled exposition influenced me, that he didn't know how many sermons there would
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.440]   be in Ephesians 1 until he finished, and there were 38.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   Right?
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.920]   He didn't know.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.440]   He took it as it came.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.760]   That was a model for me to preach Sunday by Sunday by Sunday by Sunday and see what you
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   get when you're finished.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   What else?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   Consecutive exposition.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   Wait, hold on.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   So on that one.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.880]   Lloyd-Jones, when you go into the pulpit, you don't know how far you're going to get
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.640]   in the chapter?
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.840]   I have an idea that it may work out and it may not work out.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   Yeah, and the point there is it's leaving room for the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   Absolutely.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   You don't know.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.640]   You may get so much more liberty, and you've got two sermons instead of one.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:38.240]   And Lloyd-Jones said, he said, "The failure of preaching is not because preachers don't
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.400]   know enough about a man and his problems."
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.320]   I think that's the way you put it.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.680]   Failure of preaching is they don't know enough about the Word and the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.000]   And just another thing, content, he was focused on the sovereignty of God and the glory of
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.440]   God in all of his preaching.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:03.180]   I felt another thing that his ministry did for me was to show me the path of maintaining
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.880]   biblical authority in epic confrontations.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.080]   And that really came to the fore, not only in the Anglican situation, but it was exacerbated
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.680]   in the Billy Graham years from, what, '54 to '66?
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.080]   And he would not equivocate on biblical authority.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.920]   He would not sit on a platform with men who denied biblical authority.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   He wouldn't be a part of cooperative evangelism.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.520]   In fact, you write about the time that he…
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.880]   I think it was around 1966, before that Berlin event, that the Graham Organization asked
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.680]   him to be the chair of that event, and he said, "I'll do it on two grounds.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.840]   One, you remove all people from prominent positions who are not faithful to the authority
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   of Scripture, and two, you take out the invitation of the decisionism."
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   Right?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   That's right.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.120]   And there was no deal.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.680]   No, there was no deal.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.400]   I think he knew that when he made the offer.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.700]   Yes.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:14.080]   But he influenced me on holding that line, and one other immense influence on me was
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.840]   his book on the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:27.200]   He rather effectively took shots at dispensationalism, old traditional dispensationalism in which
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.840]   I was raised.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.400]   When I started into the ministry, I had been taught that the Sermon on the Mount belonged
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   in the future millennium and had nothing to do with the church age, which I didn't understand
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:47.560]   and believe, and systematically, page by page by page, the Lord used Lloyd-Jones to dismantle
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.680]   that notion.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.560]   And by the time I got preaching through five to seven, people on the dispensational side
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.800]   thought I'd abandoned the faith.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   I hadn't, but I had come to, I think, a correct understanding of that greatest, really, of
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.440]   all New Testament evangelistic sermons.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Yes.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.520]   So on Lloyd-Jones books, I might just say, much as I'd like to push a banner of truth
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:22.440]   book, it's the InterVarsity IVP, Studies in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.760]   If you haven't started reading Lloyd-Jones, that's an excellent, perhaps the best starting
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   point.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.520]   Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, it's in the bookstore here.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   Is it?
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   Good.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.040]   And then I could just throw in the book Knowing the Times, which is a book of his addresses,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.560]   not sermons, but addresses in which he does talk about the church and the situation and
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.840]   our evangelical policy.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.400]   That's a very good starting point, too.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.960]   Can I say one other thing about Lloyd-Jones that I learned from you?
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:59.680]   That when he, as a medical doctor, was invited to speak to the Welsh people, he went in and
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   decried the degraded state of Welsh preaching, right?
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.240]   Did he not tell them that the problems in the country were because of the decline of
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.760]   the church and the decline of the church was related to the decline in preaching?
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   Yes, certainly.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.480]   Yes, it was a tradition of preaching that had just become traditional and professional,
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.960]   and it wasn't doctrinal, and it didn't disturb anyone, did it?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   People were easily made church members and the church had…
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.200]   But at that time when he first started saying that, he was still a layman, was he not?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.600]   Yes, yes, I'm back with you now.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   That was pretty bold.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.120]   1925 he's talking about.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   That was pretty…
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   I wasn't there, by the way.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   I just want to know.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.000]   I don't think even Ian was there in 1925.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.160]   No, that's right.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.200]   He spoke in South Wales and the newspapers caught up on what he was saying, and they
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.360]   thought this was very arrogant again, I suppose.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   John?
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.200]   Just for the audio sermons, I did have two recommendations to pick up on John's point
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.760]   about not sending out a syllabus for preaching, leaving room for the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.960]   The very first sermon, if you go to the website and go to the Book of Romans, the very first
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.640]   sermon is a sermon called "A Man Called Paul," and there are a couple of things that are
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.440]   very helpful to understand his ministry.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.040]   One is a full-throated defense of the much maligned Apostle Paul.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   The second thing is his whole approach to doing expositional series.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.440]   The other one, which every sermon is a relationship between yourself and God and affects people
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.360]   differently, but in Ephesians 2 there is a sermon called "But God," where having described
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.560]   a problem of man and the state of sin and the utter hopelessness that we find ourselves
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:49.200]   in, the words "But God" and what that meant for us, which I think is by any measure pretty
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   powerful.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.040]   If you've never listened to a Lloyd-Jones sermon, go look up that one on "But God" and
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.400]   listen to that, very powerful.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.680]   And as far as reading, Ian, what about the plight of man and the power of God?
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:08.400]   >> Yes, these were addresses he gave in Edinburgh, 1939-40, from Romans chapter 1.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.480]   It was the first published work on Romans.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.320]   >> I think they're a good summary of the gospel.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.880]   It's kind of like Greg Gilbert's "What is the Gospel?"
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Only Lloyd-Jones, 1945.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   >> Yes, yes, sure.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   Very good.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.880]   >> Short, powerful.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:30.320]   >> And another short book, which Banner do, it's in the book on authority, "Authority
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.040]   of Scripture, Authority of Christ, Authority of the Holy Spirit."
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.400]   >> Ian, what was it like to listen to him preach?
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   You heard him preach at Westminster Chapel a couple hundred times maybe?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.080]   >> I suppose so, yeah.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   Well, I think with all good preaching, if it really is good preaching in the biblical
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.640]   sense of good preaching, you very quickly forget the man who's preaching.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.800]   And that's what happened with the Lloyd-Jones.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.600]   God was speaking to you.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.880]   And yeah, I think that is a mark of real preaching.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.000]   You forget about the man himself.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.400]   The great deficiency that we suffer from is that way back in the 1950s, nobody thought
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.080]   of gatherings like this.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.360]   And the result is we don't have, as Jonathan may correct me, but as far as I know, we don't
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.840]   have a single recording of a full service at Westminster Chapel.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.460]   And that is a real loss because the service led to the sermon.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.380]   And they were united.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.400]   And he led the whole service.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.520]   And you didn't notice him doing it.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.480]   I believe it's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.600]   As with Spurgeon, people didn't say when Spurgeon was preaching, "Why doesn't he let other people
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   do things?"
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.360]   When the Holy Spirit is speaking, the man himself is in the background.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.180]   But that is a real loss that we don't have.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.560]   Do we have any recorded service of a typical Sunday at Westminster?
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.080]   So, tell us what a typical Sunday service would be like.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.680]   Well, he would come quietly into the pulpit, bow his head for a moment at the desk.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.200]   Then the doxology would be sung without intonation.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.640]   And then he would lead in a brief prayer.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.960]   And then the first hymn which he would announce, and it would be a hymn leading into worship,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.560]   and perhaps especially for the Lord's Day.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.160]   And then the morning service would always include one medical psalm, but there'd be
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   four sermons.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.200]   There would be what we call the long prayer, pastoral prayer.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:52.120]   And then brief notices by the church secretary, who had been at Princeton in 1906, and in
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.920]   the 1950s he was still attired as though it was Princeton in 1906.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.840]   And then a hymn before the sermon, and then the sermon.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.360]   But by the time the sermon came, generally you were gripped.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.080]   There's no question of the preacher having to get the attention of the people and tell
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.160]   them a little story to interest them.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.100]   So losing the service, we've really lost something.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.600]   But he would have probably said, "You can't put that on tape."
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.240]   >> He didn't like to have his sermons recorded.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.440]   >> He wouldn't have cared to have all his prayers and things.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.000]   He wouldn't have cared for that.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400]   >> Maybe that's why we don't have any tapes of that.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.000]   >> No, I think it's because, I mean, the taping really began before he had, you know, it was
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.800]   kind of a little surreptitiously done.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.520]   >> Did he not know he was being taped?
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.500]   >> Well, there were two elderly ladies in Shropshire, and the plea was they would like
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.480]   to hear, they can't get out to church and they would like to hear these.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:04.840]   And he knew about that, but there was rather more going on than he knew.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.320]   >> Church hasn't really changed that much.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.300]   >> That is something I learned with him.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.320]   If you wanted to do something which you thought he wouldn't approve, you just had to do it
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.240]   and then afterwards take whatever came.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.720]   >> Thank you for teaching staff that.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.480]   >> So John, as a man with a lot of experience preaching, what do you make of Lloyd-Jones
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.000]   as a preacher?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.080]   Do you, when you listen to him preach, are you thinking, "That's something I could never
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   do?"
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.640]   Are you thinking, "That's what I do every Sunday, that's what every preacher does every
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   Sunday."
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.160]   Are you thinking, "Oh, I wish he didn't do that."
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.560]   What do you think of him when you listen to him preach?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.720]   >> I don't think I dissect the event.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.600]   I don't think I take apart what he's doing.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.080]   He's always been so compelling to me.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:05.840]   You know, just one little illustration of that is he believed in law work in evangelism.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.200]   >> Absolutely, yes.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.120]   >> That you had to preach the law, confront sin.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.840]   And he not only believed you needed to tell the sinner he was a sinner, but you needed
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.160]   to prove it to him.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.600]   And so there was all of this argument that was going on, this logical argument.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.040]   He was pinning the sinner down.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.960]   And that's what you get with Lloyd-Jones when you listen to him preach.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.920]   You're swept up and you can't see the skeleton.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.960]   This thing is fleshed out.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.440]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.680]   Thank you for saying that, John.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.160]   That's so important.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   He meant to disturb people.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.360]   People complained that this man talks to us as though we're sinners.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.280]   And when Lloyd-Jones heard that, he was encouraged.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.200]   It's true.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.240]   And sometimes people left Westminster Chapel vowing they'd never come here again.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   But they did.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.800]   They did come again.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.960]   So he did speak very plainly to people.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.360]   And again, it was the sense that it wasn't simply Lloyd-Jones speaking to them.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.800]   There was something more happening, conviction.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.960]   >> That's true even with the things he said to Christians.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.200]   I listened to the series on Romans 11, the benediction.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:29.560]   You're so overwhelmed with the flow of thought and the grasp that he has and the intensity
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:37.800]   and the energy and the strength of this argument and this unpacking that you really are.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.520]   The Lord is speaking through this instrument.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.360]   >> He talked about preaching as a kind of diagnostic affair, sort of with his medical
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.920]   background where he would try to understand the nature of the problem, ask questions,
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.000]   express, sounds also a little bit like a lawyer arguing, trying to do more than I think we
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.300]   often do with our sermons today.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:05.000]   We often today may presume less of our congregations than he seemed to.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.460]   >> Yes.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:16.320]   He did put questions and got your attention and there was an argument there often.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.480]   And you weren't quite sure where it was leading, but he knew where it was leading and the script
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.120]   and it was of course based on the Scripture.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.840]   Isn't it true, Jonathan, that his mother said he would have made of the three brothers,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   he would have been the lawyer?
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.080]   >> Yes, his brother became a judge, but his own mother thought that he would have been
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.800]   a better judge because of the prosecutorial style.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.520]   >> When you're starting to look at Lloyd-Jones and listen to his preaching or read his books,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:52.360]   do you really need to start with theology?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.480]   >> Well he would say yes and no.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.440]   It depends what you mean by theology.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.760]   But everybody, well I say everybody, a lot of people know his definition of preaching.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.640]   Preaching is theology coming through a man who is on fire.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.620]   Well a lot of the commentators concentrate on the man and the fire, but his, he began
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.620]   it's theology.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:20.520]   But by theology he meant speaking about God.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.320]   We start with God.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   Sinner has to start with God.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   And if we don't, the gospel doesn't start with Jesus.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.240]   It doesn't start with the love of Jesus.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:40.560]   It starts with God and that's what we have to, and this is where he was out of step with
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.880]   British evangelicalism.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:50.480]   When he came on the scene, evangelicalism had become narrowed into a beginning at once
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.440]   with Christ and conversion and a decision, and he came in from a different direction.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:04.240]   He came in from the direction of Romans 1, 2, and most of 3 before you then get to Christ
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.820]   the propitiation.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.080]   And all his ministry, that's what he was doing.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:16.120]   And that was quite contrary to the prevailing evangelical view and made some people say,
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.360]   this man isn't an evangelist.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.560]   He can't be talking like this.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.840]   Some preachers seem to begin their preaching with all of their theology assembled and they
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:33.040]   preach for 20, 30, 40 years and their theology has really not changed at all, not been refined
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   much.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.400]   It's still the same things they thought when they began.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:43.080]   Lloyd-Jones more than most, and I'm taking this partly from reading his own messages,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.160]   you know, and being aware of when they were preached, but also from your books, brother,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   he seemed to develop a lot theologically.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.840]   For somebody to whom theology was so important, his understanding of justification seemed
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.200]   to be much clearer in 1950 than it would have been, say, even when he first started preaching.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   Is that fair?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.320]   Yes, it is.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.720]   He did mature.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.800]   When he first started preaching, he was very strong on regeneration, the new birth.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.360]   Christian is a new creation.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.680]   If you're not that, you're not a Christian.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:23.880]   And the justification and the atonement were rather assumed and in the background.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   And late 1920s, this came to him with much greater clarity and force.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.640]   And then in 1932 when he was in Toronto and started to read Warfield, the view of the
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:43.040]   majesty of God and the wonder of the plan of salvation became clearer to him.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   Yes, we all develop.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.200]   We develop.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.160]   And because of that development, are there any of his early sermons that people often
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.240]   read that you're saying, well, actually they're not… they're not really as useful as his
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.760]   later sermons?
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:04.880]   Well, some of the Old Testament evangelistic sermons that Banner has printed, they're
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.240]   all good to read.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.440]   Some of them, I don't think he wouldn't have preached in that way in later years,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.160]   but they're worth reading because they show how he's getting through to people and disturbing
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.120]   people and certainly leading them to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.440]   Why do you think he disturbed people so much?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.040]   I mean, he is often associated with controversy.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:34.640]   Well, the great David Brainard said, "No one can speak to people's consciences without
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.600]   being filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.480]   And I'm sure that comes into it.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   It's not something you get out of books, but if a man is anointed with the Holy Spirit,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.800]   he is speaking to people's hearts and consciences.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:58.600]   So Lloyd-Jones, although he had such a powerful mind, he was speaking very much to the conscience.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.880]   And that's New Testament, isn't it?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.420]   Manifesting the truth to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.520]   And on that point, he would have disagreed with people who say, "We've got a great
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.760]   problem today, that there's such a gap between the church and the world, there's no point
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.960]   of communication."
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   Not at all.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.520]   They've all got consciences.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.560]   There's a witness on God's side in every person's heart, and we've got to speak
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   to that.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.760]   See, that's another thing from his life that I saw, that I found a parallel.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.240]   You have an ally in the unregenerate heart, in the conscience and the law of God written
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   in the heart.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.800]   You run at that.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   He knew that.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   Yes.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   You don't have…
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.360]   That's why he felt so strongly against psychology.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.600]   Psychologists were saying, "You have to know yourself."
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.200]   And Lloyd-Jones was saying, "You have to know God."
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   That's right.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.680]   And he knew he had to go at the conscience, at the law of God written in the heart.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.240]   Very helpful early on.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:06.000]   Ian, what's come of that emphasis that was so clear in his preaching on revival?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.080]   First of all, what did Lloyd-Jones mean by revival?
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.880]   Lloyd-Jones believed that the work of the kingdom of God does not progress through history
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.440]   at an even level.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   It's not always summertime.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.680]   Sometimes it's like winter.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   God doesn't leave the church ever, but there are times of decay, times even of apostasy.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.880]   And he was a great reader of church history, and he knew from church history that there
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:42.640]   were periods when the same men were endued with the Spirit in a new way, and they saw
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   consequences in their ministry that they hadn't seen in preaching through 20 years.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.000]   They were preaching the same sermons, but God gave them additional aid.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.320]   And so he believed a revival was an unusual outpouring or effusion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.960]   and that it was to be seen by deeper hunger for the Word of God, closer eagerness to hear
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.040]   the Word of God.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.180]   So the sort of tests that Jonathan Edwards gave, a revival isn't to be judged by the
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.520]   excitement or whether people fall down or laugh or cry.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.060]   That's nothing.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.320]   Revival produces moral change and can affect whole communities.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.200]   And in real revivals, we know that's happened.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.840]   People make restitution, thieving is stopped, police run out of work in some parts of the
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   country.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.480]   That's the kind of awakening we haven't seen in Britain for many years.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   He believed that's possible.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.720]   And in the 1960s, he preached a good deal on that, and a lot of people thought, "Well,
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.640]   we're quite near a real revival."
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.680]   He didn't actually believe that.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.960]   When he was asked the question, "Do you think a revival is near?"
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.360]   "No," he said, "I don't."
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.680]   "Oh," they said, "why not?"
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.400]   "Because we're too healthy," he said.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.200]   "We're not really in a position of crying to God out of need."
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.120]   So but there were then those who joined on a bandwagon, "Revival is the message," and
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.560]   they preached revival.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.320]   But when it didn't appear, well, then another message came, and then the charismatic movement
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   came.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   And so, you know, God tests men and our belief, doesn't he?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.720]   So a real awakening is what is needed in Britain today and in America today.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:34.800]   And while we thank God for lumbers and the books and the tapes, the sign of God's working,
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.440]   but we need more.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.760]   - If you've not read Ian Murray's book, Evangelicalism Divided, I would encourage you to get a copy
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.160]   of that and read it.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.120]   He recounts a lot about Lloyd-Jones ministry in context at the time, also pointing out
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.240]   some helpful points about revival and about controversy.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.680]   And I think ends up, although some people know the book as a kind of divisive book,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:06.220]   I think by that last chapter ends up very charitably in a way, I'm guessing you pretty
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:11.560]   well captured Lloyd-Jones' spirit in that just from what I've read of Lloyd-Jones.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.920]   - I tried to, I hope so.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   I mean, Lloyd-Jones very strongly believed that we should maintain friendship and kindness
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.240]   to people with whom we disagreed, and he did that, much did he do.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.480]   - If I could just jump in on that one point, I think that's a very true statement that
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.800]   he believed passionately that you should stand up for what you believe is right, and he thought
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.280]   that was the example set by the Apostle Paul, that as individuals we're sinners and we're
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.560]   frail and personal relations are very important.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.040]   So with a number of the people around whom some of the controversy occurred in the '60s
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.440]   and the '70s, whose names I won't mention because I don't think it's right, they would
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.800]   come to the house and he would talk to them and they would maintain very good personal
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:55.120]   relations even if they had disagreement, which is, he believed to be the Christian standard.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:02.680]   - John, in his book on preaching, Preaching and Preachers, he has a lot of very strong
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.920]   and clear instructions to the preacher and opinions on preaching.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.720]   Is this a book you encourage young preachers to read?
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.200]   - I do.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.560]   That's where I first picked up on the fact that he didn't think sermons should be recorded
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.900]   because he believed that this…
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:29.280]   He really believed that preaching was a Holy Spirit-led, Holy Spirit-empowered event.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.760]   - It was not casual about it at all.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.840]   - No, no, no, not casual at all, and that to record that somehow and pull that out of
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:46.560]   the context of what it was, was to strip it of the divine element, divine intention.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:55.880]   And I think while I didn't agree with that at the time, I understand how you can can
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.600]   information and distribute it and it could be void.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:07.000]   That's why Ian is saying that he misses so much about not having the service because
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.320]   that was all a part of what Lloyd-Jones saw as that event, that Spirit-driven event.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.640]   - You put your finger on it.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.440]   He was afraid that tapes would just be taken and while you're washing the car or scrubbing
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.280]   the floor, you could listen to tapes.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.960]   Well, we know that can't be done in the right spirit, but there is a danger that the tape
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   becomes separate from worship.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.520]   And he believed if you were listening to a sermon, you should give your whole being to
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   it.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.520]   It's part of the worship of God.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.960]   It's not something to be done off and on and interrupted with phone calls and stuff like
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   that.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.680]   - Because that's to take it too casually.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.160]   - That's a high view of the Word of God.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.120]   It is the Word of God speaking to us.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.160]   - One of the things I remember Jim Packer saying about going to Westminster Chapel and
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.760]   hearing Lloyd-Jones preach in the '50s was that there was a profound sense of the presence
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.600]   of God.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.700]   It was in no way a casual thing, but that there was just…
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.420]   Even before he would begin to speak, when he would just be in the pulpit, there would
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.460]   be such a sense of anticipation of what God's Spirit would do because he so regularly and
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:21.460]   faithfully did that through the preaching there, that there was a heavy sense.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.700]   - I think you talk about the fact that in one of the books, maybe in the newer one,
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:33.260]   that he always selected worship hymns that were objective propositional declarations
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.420]   of the nature of God.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.980]   That's how it all began.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.500]   - Yes, the first part of the service, yes, that's right.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.300]   And then invitational hymns to the conclusion.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.620]   And also he was so…
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.820]   His view of worship was such that occasionally he would stop in the middle of a hymn and
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.700]   tell the congregation, "You're not really singing these words."
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.220]   They were singing the tune and enjoying the tune, and he would stop them.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.340]   And someone might say, "Well, how did he know that?"
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:08.740]   - Well, I think you get a sense when a large audience is just enjoying the music.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   - Yeah.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:19.340]   I don't know if I can express this, but he believed that the glory of God was absolutely
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   everything.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.620]   And so he didn't do what typical American contemporary preachers might do, and that's
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   welcome people to the church.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.500]   - No, he didn't.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.580]   Even if the queen had come, he wouldn't have welcomed her.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.180]   He would have taken the view, "This is a great privilege to come to…"
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.460]   - But you weren't coming to the church, you were coming…
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.460]   - That's right.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.020]   That's why he actually never said good morning or anything like that.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.700]   He said, "If it was my home, I would welcome you, but this isn't my home.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.900]   I don't say good morning to people when they…
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.660]   They've not come to meet me."
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.180]   - Well, there you have it.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.340]   If you've not listened to Lloyd-Jones preach, I remember John Piper, I don't know if you
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.820]   remember seeing this on a phone call a few years ago, we were talking about some problem
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.540]   and John just pipes up.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:16.060]   And he, out of the blue, we hadn't been talking about Lloyd-Jones at all, and he said, "If
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.500]   they'd just ever heard Lloyd-Jones preach, we wouldn't be having this problem."
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   You remember that?
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   No, anyway.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   Well, it's the truth.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:28.660]   Gentlemen, we need to stop so people would have time for dinner.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.420]   Jonathan, any final thing you think you want to encourage people to know or remember or
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.420]   think of?
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:40.020]   - No, I would say the end of his life was the same as the living of his life, that when
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.100]   he couldn't speak anymore and it was his final day and they wanted to keep giving him pills,
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.300]   the note that he wrote was, "Don't hold me back."
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.980]   And so as he departed was as he lived and it was a great comfort to his family as well
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.980]   as all those who had enjoyed his service.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.220]   - And I'm impressed by the quotes of Lloyd-Jones again, near the end of his life when somebody
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.380]   came to see him, no longer able to preach, they wanted to sort of encourage him a bit
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.100]   and they said, "Must be a big disappointment to you, Dr. Lloyd-Jones, that you can't preach
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.100]   anymore."
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.140]   "No," he said, "No, I never lived for preaching."
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:18.500]   And the other thing is, on prayer, people asked him, "Do you prepare your prayers?"
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.740]   "No," he said, "But I prepare myself."
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:28.540]   And that's a very… and by that really he was saying, "I do pray in private and I prepare
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   myself."
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.020]   And isn't that the most difficult thing about preaching really?
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.300]   It's one thing to prepare a sermon, but to prepare ourselves is…
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.180]   - John, would you lead us in prayer for us to be faithful in the ministry God commits
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.180]   to us?
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:50.140]   - Father, we thank You for the life of this noble servant, faithful servant, David Martin
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.140]   Lloyd-Jones.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.380]   We thank You for the legacy, he being dead yet speaks.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:40:03.620]   Thank You for extending his influence through our dear friend, Ian Murray.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:10.020]   We thank You for Jonathan and the testimony coming from a grandson to the integrity of
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:17.060]   a man who was what he preached and loved the Lord that he professed.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:24.740]   Thank You for the fact that we have his legacy now even available to us to listen to him
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.460]   as well as to read and see what you've done in the past.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.460]   These are important things for us to know.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:42.580]   The tendency today is to disdain the past and exalt the present, and this is to miss
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:48.740]   the wonder of redemptive history and how You've used faithful men.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:56.060]   And may there be some even here in this place about whom we will speak, not in this generation,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.940]   but the church will speak in generations yet to come for the way that You've used them.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.620]   us with your Holy Spirit as we serve you we pray in Christ's name. Amen.
