[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Let's move on with a question from Kevin.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Kevin asks, "What category of things do you track on your Trello board?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Well, as Kevin is hinting, and we've talked about many times before on this show,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I organize my tasks on task boards.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I happen to use Trello. There's other software that can do the same thing.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Here's my setup. I have a unique board for each of my different professional roles.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   So right now, for example, I have a board for my computer science research.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   That's my researcher role.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I have a board for my administrative and teaching roles as a professor.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So I sort of separate out those two things.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   There's a lot of work involved with getting classes together
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and other sorts of administrative details of being a professor.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   That's one board, a separate board for the research I do as a professor.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And then a separate board right now for my work as a writer.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I'm actually thinking about perhaps differentiating that into a board that focuses just on writing
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and another board that focuses on all the details of running the media,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   the fledgling media empire that is what I facetiously call Cal Newport Studios.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And I haven't yet, but I might.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   There's other times I've had other boards.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I've mentioned before during my stint as the director of graduate studies for our department,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   that got its own board. It was a whole separate role.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So I have a board for a role.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   There are some standard columns I use on almost every board.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   On almost every board, I'm going to have a column for things that need to be processed.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So I don't even really know how to get my arms around this thing that just fell on my plate.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Someone just came and said, hey, we have to figure out how to promote this new minor
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   that we're going to be launching as a program.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And I don't even know what that means and how we promote it,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   but I don't want to keep track of it in my head.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I have a column where I can put that card.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And that's a column I can come to and say when I'm doing my weekly plans,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I need to start processing some of these things,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   like figuring out what it means and making them more specific.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I usually have a column for definitely do this week.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So I'm doing my weekly plan.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I'm going to move cards onto that column that I definitely want to do this week.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I always have a waiting to hear back from column.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Okay, I'm waiting to hear back from this person on this thing so I don't forget it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And I'm going to put a card in that column under the proper role.
