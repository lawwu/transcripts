[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Many, many years ago, 1903,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk for the first time.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.900]   And you've launched a company of the same name, Kitty Hawk,
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.900]   with the dream of building flying cars, EVtols.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.540]   So at the big picture,
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.580]   what are the big challenges of making this thing
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.960]   that actually have inspired generations of people
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.700]   about what the future looks like?
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.540]   What does it take?
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.640]   What are the biggest challenges?
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.200]   - So flying cars has always been a dream.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.680]   Every boy, every girl wants to fly.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.520]   Let's be honest.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.340]   - Yes.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.320]   - And let's go back in our history
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.740]   of your dreaming of flying.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.640]   I think my, honestly,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.280]   my single most remembered childhood dream has been a dream
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.700]   where I was sitting on a pillow and I could fly.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.000]   I was like five years old.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.120]   I remember like maybe three dreams of my childhood,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.360]   but that's the one I remember most vividly.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   And then Peter Thiel famously said,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.760]   "They promised us flying cars and they gave us 140 characters,"
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.200]   pointing at Twitter at the time,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.320]   limited message size to 140 characters.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.160]   So we're coming back now to really go
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   for this super impactful stuff like flying cars.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.840]   And to be precise, they're not really cars.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.080]   They don't have wheels.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.520]   They're actually much closer to a helicopter
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.560]   than anything else.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   They take off vertically and they fly horizontally,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.320]   but they have important differences.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680]   One difference is that they are much quieter.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.560]   We just released a vehicle called Project Heaviside
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.480]   that can fly over you as low as a helicopter.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240]   And you basically can't hear it.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.680]   It's like 38 decibels.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.220]   It's like, if you were inside the library,
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.200]   you might be able to hear it,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.960]   but anywhere outdoors, your ambient noise is higher.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.000]   Secondly, they're much more affordable.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940]   They're much more affordable than helicopters.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.880]   And the reason is helicopters are expensive
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.980]   for many reasons.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.960]   There's lots of single point of figures in a helicopter.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080]   There's a bolt between the blades
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.720]   that's called Jesus bolt.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.360]   And the reason why it's called Jesus bolt
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320]   is that if this bolt breaks, you will die.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.440]   There is no second solution in helicopter flight.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   Whereas we have these distributed mechanism.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.680]   When you go from gasoline to electric,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.760]   you can now have many, many, many small motors
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.200]   as opposed to one big motor.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   And that means if you lose one of those motors,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.560]   not a big deal.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   Heaviside, if it loses a motor, has eight of those,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.960]   if it loses one of those eight motors,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   so it's seven left,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.200]   it can take off just like before
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.760]   and land just like before.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.960]   We are now also moving into a technology
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.080]   that doesn't require a commercial pilot
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440]   because in some level,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920]   flight is actually easier than ground transportation.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.660]   Like in self-driving cars,
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.440]   the world is full of like children and bicycles
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.560]   and other cars and mailboxes and curbs
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   and shrubs and what have you.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.440]   All these things you have to avoid.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.680]   When you go above the buildings and tree lines,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.520]   there's nothing there.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.040]   I mean, you can do the test right now,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   look outside and count the number of things you see flying.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   I'd be shocked if you could see more than two things.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.800]   It's probably just zero.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880]   In the Bay Area, the most I've ever seen was six
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.320]   and maybe it's 15 or 20, but not 10,000.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.920]   So the sky is very ample and very empty and very free.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   So the vision is, can we build a socially acceptable
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.280]   mass transit solution for daily transportation
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   that is affordable?
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.280]   And we have an existence proof.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   Heaviside can fly a hundred miles in range
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   with still 30% electric reserves.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.000]   It can fly up to like 180 miles an hour.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.800]   We know that that solution at scale
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.560]   would make your ground transportation 10 times as fast
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.320]   as a car based on use census or statistics data,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   which means you would take your 300 hours
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.960]   of yearly commute down to 30 hours
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   and give you 270 hours back.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.640]   Who wouldn't want, I mean, who doesn't hate traffic?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.760]   Like I hate, give me the person who doesn't hate traffic.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   I hate traffic.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   Every time I'm in traffic, I hate it.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   And if we could free the world from traffic,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.000]   we have technology, we can free the world from traffic.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.280]   We have the technology.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.000]   It's there, we have an existence proof.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.360]   It's not a technological problem anymore.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.280]   - Do you think there is a future where tens of thousands,
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   maybe hundreds of thousands of both delivery drones
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.320]   and flying cars of this kind, EV towers fill the sky?
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.880]   - I absolutely believe this.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.520]   And there's obviously the societal acceptance
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.400]   is a major question.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.880]   And of course, safety is.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.000]   I believe in safety,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.280]   we're gonna exceed ground transportation safety
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.440]   as has happened for aviation already, commercial aviation.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   And in terms of acceptance,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240]   I think one of the key things is noise.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.880]   That's why we are focusing relentlessly on noise
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.560]   and we built perhaps the quietest electric VTOL vehicle
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   ever built.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.680]   The nice thing about the sky is it's three dimensional.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.440]   So any mathematician will immediately recognize
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.880]   the difference between 1D of like a regular highway
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.160]   to 3D of a sky.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.280]   But to make it clear for the layman,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.680]   say you wanna make 100 vertical lanes
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.960]   of highway 101 in San Francisco,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.160]   because you believe building 100 vertical lanes
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.800]   is the right solution.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.120]   Imagine how much it would cost
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.320]   to stack 100 vertical lanes physically onto 101.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.240]   That would be prohibitive.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   That would be consuming the world's GDP for an entire year,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.160]   just for one highway.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   It's amazingly expensive.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   In the sky, it would just be a recompilation
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.480]   of a piece of software
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   because all these lanes are virtual.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.160]   That means any vehicle that is in conflict
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.760]   with another vehicle would just go to different altitudes
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.240]   and then the conflict is gone.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.280]   And if you don't believe this,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.480]   that's exactly how commercial aviation works.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.360]   When you fly from New York to San Francisco,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.120]   another plane flies from San Francisco to New York,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   they're at different altitudes,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.640]   so they don't hit each other.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.320]   It's a solved problem for the jet space
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.640]   and it will be a solved problem for the urban space.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.280]   There's companies like Google, Bing and Amazon
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   working on very innovative solutions
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.480]   how do we have space management.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.560]   They use exactly the same principles as we use today
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.200]   to route today's jets.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.880]   There's nothing hard about this.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.920]   - Do you envision autonomy being a key part of it
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.360]   so that the flying vehicles
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.840]   are either semi-autonomous or fully autonomous?
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.520]   - 100% autonomous, you don't want idiots like me
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.880]   flying in the sky, I promise you.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.160]   And if you have 10,000,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.960]   watch the movie "The Fifth Element"
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.160]   to get a view for what would happen
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.400]   if it's not autonomous.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.680]   - And a centralized, that's a really interesting idea
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.200]   of a centralized sort of management system
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.280]   for lanes and so on.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.760]   So actually just being able to have
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.960]   similar as we have in the current commercial aviation,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.520]   but scale it up to much more vehicles.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.640]   That's a really interesting optimization problem.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.080]   - It is mathematically very, very straightforward.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.480]   Like the gap we leave between jets is gargantuous
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.360]   and part of the reason is there isn't that many jets.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.760]   So it just feels like a good solution.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.320]   Today, when you get vectored by air traffic control,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.840]   someone talks to you, right?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   So an ATC controller might have up to maybe 20 planes
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   on the same frequency and then they talk to you,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.280]   you have to talk back.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.640]   And that feels right because there isn't more than 20 planes
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.880]   around anyhow, so you can talk to everybody.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.680]   But if there's 20,000 things around,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.920]   you can't talk to everybody anymore.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.200]   So we have to do something that's called digital,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   like text messaging.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   Like we do have solutions,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.480]   like we have what, four or five billion smartphones
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   in the world now, right?
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.680]   And they're all connected.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   And somehow we solve the scale problem for smartphones.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.520]   We know where they all are, they can talk to somebody
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.400]   and they're very reliable, they're amazingly reliable.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.560]   We could use the same system,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.000]   the same scale for air traffic control.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So instead of me as a pilot talking to a human being
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.200]   in the middle of the conversation,
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.600]   receiving a new frequency, like how ancient is that?
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.200]   We could digitize this stuff
