[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   I didn't realize this but only about 5% of mortgage holders have adjustable rate mortgages and I've
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.760]   been talking about getting an adjustable rate mortgage since I started in 2009 and since I've
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.440]   been working in finance since 2003 well since I bought my property in 2003 and the idea is look
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.520]   interest rates and inflation have been coming down for 40 years in a row because of technological
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   advances efficiencies learning about past cycles and yes we currently have elevated inflation now
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.480]   due to a global pandemic but you are seeing inflation top tick in July and I think that's
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.840]   going to fade into 2023 it's just the way it is yin yang finance when prices are up demand starts
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.760]   to get destroyed and then we get back to the normal steady state and so the idea with an arm is
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.240]   look you pay a lower rate than a 30-year fixed because of the time value of money if you're
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.000]   borrowing at a shorter fixed rate return the lender will pay you will lend to you at a lower rate
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.920]   and the thing is back in the global financial crisis days the median or the average home
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.840]   ownership tenure was about four and a half five years now the average home ownership tenureship
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.640]   is about 10 to 11 years the idea is you want to max your fixed rate duration of your mortgage
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.920]   with how long you plan to live in your home hello and welcome to another episode of all the hacks
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.120]   a show about upgrading your life money and travel i'm your host chris hutchins and each week i sit
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.520]   down with the world's best experts to learn the strategies tactics and frameworks that shape their
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   success today i'm talking with sam dogan known online as the financial samurai his website is
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240]   one of the top personal finance destinations with over a million visitors each month he's been
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   writing there for over a decade and there is so much good content the first time i found myself
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   on your site i think i ended up with at least 50 tabs open and i've read them for hours and this
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.960]   summer his first traditionally published book came out called buy this not that how to spend your way
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.000]   to wealth and freedom and it's already a wall street journal bestseller he wrote the book to
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   try to take the guesswork out of financial planning and shows readers exactly what to buy
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.920]   how much to spend and how to optimize every dollar they earn so they can maximize their wealth
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.640]   building and live life on their term we're going to talk about the seven core principles of financial
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.840]   samurai how sam engineered his own layoff and the principles you can use to do it yourself if you're
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   thinking about changing jobs how real estate can be a big source of passive income without actually
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.360]   needing to collect and manage dozens of rental properties around the globe why we should all
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.040]   consider having our own online real estate small business or even side hustle his 70 30 rule for
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.000]   decision making especially when it comes to taking risk and because sam is a few years ahead of me
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.640]   in the parenting journey i have a few questions on that topic as well so let's get started
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:02.320]   sam grats on the bestseller welcome to the show hey thanks so much for having me it's an honor
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.280]   and i appreciate the intro you write a lot about money but like you do in the book i want to start
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.400]   with talking about the point of all these financial optimizations surely it's not just to be a scrooge
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   mcduck sleeping on a pile of cash right if money is a means to the end what is that end you know
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.200]   that's absolutely right the reason why money is not the end goal uh is because it's just a tool
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.720]   it's just a made-up tool to help try to buy things that will provide for a better lifestyle
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.680]   if money was an object the sole object for me i would have kept on working in banking
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.480]   after my 34th birthday but i decided enough was enough i didn't like it anymore after the 10th
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   year and after the global financial crisis i was like this is not really what i want to be doing
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.240]   with my life i wanted to have more purpose i wanted to feel that i was helping people just
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   regular people more so i left i left in 2012 at the age of 34 and i haven't been back to a day
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.680]   job since you define happiness as progress is that right that is my one word definition of
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.120]   happiness progress whether it's progress in your finances in your relationship with your significant
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.520]   other with your children with a hobby that you're trying to get better at progress is my one word
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.320]   definition of happiness is that the end goal is just making progress towards all the things you
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.520]   care about is that how you view what money allows you to do or or what life's for you know it's
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.240]   it's like one of those interview questions like what is that one word right so that would be my
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   word but i don't know if that's the end goal i think we always need to try to improve ourselves
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.480]   in whatever endeavor we take on we should probably try to challenge ourselves in something that's a
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.680]   little bit scary a little bit impossible sounding so that at least we don't look back with regret
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.440]   having not tried our best or not having not tried at all i want to go back to you started down this
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   road of being 34 and leaving your day job you know you've actually i know you engineered a
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.800]   layoff to leave that job and i know you've actually written a book with now five editions about doing
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.920]   that so first how did you know that that an alternate path would be the right move for your
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.160]   career and and then i also want to get to how others can use some of those tactics to engineer
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.920]   their own layoffs it happened well i started financial samurai july 2009 that was literally
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.360]   the bottom of the global financial crisis i'd lost 35 percent of my net worth in six months that took
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.320]   10 years to accumulate so i was really bummed out and i had graduated from business school
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.600]   part-time in 2006 and wanted to start financial samurai but i didn't because i always had these
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.200]   excuses not to i said i want to go give back to my firm because they paid for 80 plus percent of
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   my tuition let's just focus but then when the global financial crisis hit i was thinking to
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.960]   myself man i need a backup i need to start doing something new so that if i were to get laid off
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.560]   i could uh write on financial samurai and so financial samurai gave me that purpose
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.200]   to do something new to find something that i was passionate about which was writing and connecting
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.080]   with people all over the world and it was in october november 2011 the year before i left
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.640]   banking for good where i was in santorini greece and it was 78 degrees sunny i was hiking up the
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.960]   crater and for two hours and then suddenly i was like oh there's like a nice bar with wi-fi i was
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.080]   like oh let's uh let's have a beer and there's an eight euro mythos beer i was like wow that's
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.120]   expensive but uh give me one how how often am i going to go back to santorini at the top of the
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.960]   crater and in my inbox uh on my phone was a email from this advertising client in the united kingdom
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.360]   and he said hey sam i want to advertise on your website i'll put up this link and i'll pay you
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.600]   i think it's eleven hundred dollars i said oh eleven hundred dollars i'm actually closer to
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   you right now than i am when i was in san francisco so i was like okay send me the code i will try to
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.760]   put it up on my phone and it's still pretty novel at the time right 2011 iphone wi-fi and then within
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.400]   30 minutes he paypal 1100 bucks and i was thinking that's good money i was like give me another beer
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   and that was when i thought ah there could be a life after banking and i enjoyed writing and
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.720]   i knew i wouldn't starve if i was able to negotiate a severance so there's two two components there
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.240]   one i want to ask is did you actually when you decided to leave get financial samurai to a place
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.880]   that it was going to replace your job or did you more just get it to a place that you saw
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:42.000]   an opportunity to do something different so my goal first of all was to save and invest at least
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.520]   50 percent of my after-tax income every year until age 40 but i didn't last till age 40 i lasted till
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   age 34 and the reason why was because i was able to negotiate a severance because during the global
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.120]   financial crisis you know talk about making lemonade i saw many people get laid off and some
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   of them were my friends so i asked them hey is everything okay can i help you find a job do you
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.400]   want to interview with me you know i'm still surviving and a lot of them were thankful and
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.200]   we tried but i also asked them are they okay and they said yeah i'm okay because i got a severance
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.560]   equal to two to three weeks per year work two to three weeks worth of pay and that was when i
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.080]   realized oh well uh come 2012 i will have been at my previous firm Credit Suisse for 11 years
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:36.000]   so if they gave me two to three weeks worth of severance you know that's 22 to 33 weeks and if
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.280]   they could give me my deferred compensation because i was an executive director then and i had three
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:48.320]   years of deferred compensation in stock and cash and a private investment that they made us buy in
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.840]   2010 which were full of those quote toxic assets if i could get that severance and all my deferred
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.320]   compensation there was no reason why i shouldn't take that leap of faith because it bought years
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.520]   of living expenses most people listening to this are not i mean hopefully we aren't in the middle
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.680]   of a global financial crisis maybe just like a minor uh recession but you know are the tactics
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   you use something that anyone could use or they really dialed into i'm in the financial company
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.640]   in the middle of a financial crisis yes these are the tactics that anybody in any organization can
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.320]   use because the biggest pushback i have is why would anybody give me a severance if i'm a decent
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.600]   employee right i'm great whatever the point is if you want to leave anyway and your heart is not
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.160]   into it your employer doesn't really want you they want someone who's hungry who wants to do their
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.760]   best to stay over time do whatever and if you are a manager in this environment still in this
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.360]   environment it is very hard to find a replacement it could take three months six months and once you
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.960]   find the replacement it could take three to six months to train them to be up to par with your
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   level and so if you say peace out see you later two weeks notice you actually leave your colleagues
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   and your manager in a lurch they're going to be scrambling to find your replacement and they're
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.600]   going to be suffering while they're looking for your replacement and so the idea of negotiating
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.120]   severance is to think about the classic win-win scenario how can you help your colleagues and
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.400]   your manager find your replacement provide seamless transition during that replacement
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.120]   finding and train them so that when you leave hopefully they'll save money and they'll replace
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:37.520]   you with someone who's hungrier cheaper and just more motivated in general and so that's the simple
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.320]   trade-off it's i'm going to help you make this transition easy and in return you're going to give
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.200]   me money or vested stock or something and how have you seen that work i'm sure you've gotten readers
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.720]   right back say this worked it didn't work what's the kind of hit rate the hit rate is high it's
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.680]   like 80 plus percent and a lot of people just come back to me and say i cannot believe i was able
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.840]   to leave on my terms i mean a severance can not only be just a severance check but it can be hey
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.120]   how about work three days a week out of five and we'll still pay you the same amount of money so
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.040]   if you're working 40 percent less it's kind of like getting a 60 percent raise if you do that
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   for six months a lot of people be like hey i'll take that i mean that's pretty good belt don't
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.160]   have to work for two days a week shut it off and do my own thing i mean so it's really great and
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   a lot of people have just surprised and shocked by how how they were able to negotiate something
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.680]   that they thought was not possible and in this day and age you know i think the reason why a
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.240]   lot of people will ghost people on the phone text message email or not you know they want to just
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.800]   break up over the phone is because they're afraid of confrontation and that's i would say like
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.560]   natural but it's also kind of cowardly right you want to face your oppressor you want to face
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.600]   the people who could help you and say look these are my reasons for leaving i've been a loyal
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.000]   soldier um and the other thing is companies are afraid of backlash this is one of the things that
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.280]   companies are really afraid of there's social media there's bloggers you can blow up a company
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.640]   online and say like a lot of bad things and like a tell all that's the last thing a company wants
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.280]   that's you know reputational damage and so companies understand this they don't want to
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   get into a long litigation process they don't want to get their reputation smeared so they
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   want to work with employees who have actually been there for at least a couple years three years
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.720]   and try to come up with a win-win scenario is that metric that you had at credit suisse of two
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.160]   to three uh you know weeks pay for every year worked is that a general benchmark that kind of
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.560]   still applies or what do you think kind of is a broad applic broadly applicable benchmark for
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.160]   a severance package one to three weeks and three weeks being at the high end maybe four weeks but
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.440]   it's usually one to three weeks and there's one thing that people don't really understand and that
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   is to differentiate between the warn act which is a worker adjustment uh training notification
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.800]   and a severance so warn act pay is reserved for larger companies usually i think it's um
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.600]   in the hundreds or thousands of people and they do a mass layoff they're uh mandated by law to
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.200]   provide it's it's one to three months of severance pay or not severance pay actually one to three
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:35.280]   months of pay that's by law mandatory whereas a severance is optional a severance is the company
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.680]   can pay you or they won't pay you right and so the idea is a lot of people who get two months uh
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   they think it's severance but it's actually mandatory warneck pay severance goes above
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.760]   and beyond that and so now you're you're on your own and you start financials or you're still let
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.680]   me think where i take this um i know there are a lot of people listening who might want to use some
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.400]   of these tactics so i'll link the book in the show notes because you know we're not going to spend a
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.360]   whole episode on how to engineer layoff though i'm sure we could um and can people reach out
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.880]   if they have questions or how do you feel about comments and feedback so yeah just go check out
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:19.760]   financialsamurai.com to buy how to engineer layoff it's about severance negotiations and i also have
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.040]   a lot of articles online about severance negotiations for free so you just google

[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.640]   see it from the back end and if you have a question i can respond to it so you end the new book with
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   seven principles uh is there one that stands above the rest well the one core principle that i have
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.800]   held on to for as long as i can remember maybe since middle school is to never fail due to a
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:53.920]   lack of effort because effort requires no skill and this is really really an important principle
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.840]   because life is not fair some people have better advantages than you wealthier parents some people
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   are stronger naturally smarter whatever the case may be the playing field is never ever ever fair
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.040]   and we have to accept that but if we never fail due to a lack of effort that means we are always
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.400]   going to try our best and if we lose it's not going to be because we didn't try our best it
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.440]   can be because the opponent was faster quicker smarter whatever it is more connected but if we
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.000]   do our best we're always going to be satisfied and we'll never look back with regret having not tried
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.200]   our best is there a reason why you chose to have seven principle it seems like this is the core
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.440]   principle that you live by and have for a while um you know does it deserve to be elevated to be
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.560]   the core there are a lot of different things and so if you can adopt this core principle in
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:57.120]   everything you do whether it's doing your podcast writing uh at your job raising a family the key
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   really is to i just hate looking back on life with regret and if you've seen um what is that
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.360]   wonderful movie at the end inception or actually at the beginning i don't want to be an old man
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.320]   full of regret dying alone you know so that's that's just the idea behind that core principle
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.800]   i also want to talk about the last one about thinking in probabilities and not absolutes
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.400]   i know you have a framework for decision making uh i know you also are a big fan of annie duke's
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.120]   thinking in bets and i'll just preface that she's coming on the show next week we're going to record
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   an episode all about this but i know you've adapted your own rule the 70 30 rule and i'm
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.160]   curious how people can start to use that in their lives yeah so it is very important to think in
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.480]   probabilities and not absolutes so you don't miss out on opportunities think about if you had to
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.280]   feel you needed 100 certainty to make a decision how many opportunities would pass you by whether
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.000]   it's job opportunities whether it's the girl or boy that you like that you were too afraid to ask
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.760]   out because you were afraid of rejection it's such a shame to have to think in 100 probability
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   and if you think about it as an investor investors don't think in 100 probabilities they think
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:20.720]   if i can get my investments right at least 51 of the time i'm gonna make a lot of money over decades
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.360]   and so my idea is to create a 70 30 decision making framework which states if you believe
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.000]   with a 70 probability or greater your decision is the correct one the right one then go with
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   it with 100 conviction while having the humility knowing that 30 of the time hopefully less you'll
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.520]   get it wrong and so long as you don't die or something catastrophic happens you're going
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:52.800]   to learn from your mistakes and get better over time and so your other question was how do we hone
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.840]   that decision making probability framework and again if you adopt everything with a probability
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   matrix it helps you in making better decisions for example golden state warriors right let's say
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   it's nba playoffs you know i love the warriors and you start thinking about okay before the game
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.640]   starts who's going to win and by how much and then after the game is over you'll find out who won and
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.320]   by how much and then you will basically compare the results to your estimates and you will hone
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   your skills over time and i think you'll be able to look at things in a probability matrix and get
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.920]   better and it's not just basketball or you know who's going to win the dog show or how long your
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.280]   friend's marriage is going to last or whether they get into college or whatever it's everything
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.480]   everything once you start looking at things in a probability matrix things change and that is one
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.800]   of your key competitive advantages is there a common financial decision that you think people
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:55.440]   make where adopting this framework would kind of change the way they approach it in a positive way
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.600]   as an investor you have to be humble you have to be humble and you have to always accept that you
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   will lose money that is the price you pay for putting money to work you will lose money so
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.160]   accept that and once you accept that loss you will be okay once you finally do start losing money
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.080]   and i think that is the thing that a lot of people have a problem with and that's managing fear of
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.000]   allocating their capital towards something that could make the money or could lose the money
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.720]   because we all know the pain of losing money is greater than the joy of making money so it's
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.560]   being able to accept that loss and try to improve your investing probability going forward i want
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   to move on to another topic that i know is a a big component of your passive income which is real
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.960]   estate so i you don't seem to have the traditional financial independence real estate approach which
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.600]   is buy rental properties all over the country hire managers and manage them but it still makes up a
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.920]   good percentage of your income i'm curious how you arrived at this approach what it actually is
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.960]   and if you think it's probably a more applicable to people i didn't i didn't know there was a
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.240]   traditional fire way to do real estate as someone who helped kickstart the modern day firing movement
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:16.640]   in 2009 i didn't i didn't realize that well i mean this is just my perspective seeing the internet of
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.960]   people talking about financial independence it seems like everyone's goal is to just accrue more
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.040]   and more and more rental properties uh buy and then graduate to buy you know apartment complexes
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:34.240]   and i've always been someone who didn't want to manage being a landlord and so i've maybe gone the
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.320]   other direction which is like real estate let's just not focus on it much yes we own a home and
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.000]   some reets but then you kind of have this middle approach at least my perspective from reading
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.600]   the book and your site and i'm just fascinated about finding a middle ground in having real
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.560]   estate be a part of your portfolio without having to be a landlord at least as much of a landlord
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.600]   as some so the reason why i heavily invested in real estate was because i worked in equities
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.200]   banking equity so my compensation my promotion schedule all that was tied to the stock market
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:15.760]   so 50 of every paycheck and 90 of every year in bonus was tried it was allocated towards real
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   estates to diversify my net worth and essentially my framework and my recommendation to the average
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.400]   person is to get neutral real estate as soon as you believe you're going to be in one place for
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.920]   five ten years and neutral real estate just means owning your primary residence it means you're
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.520]   going up and down with the market you're short real estate short if you're a renter because
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.160]   you're a price taker of ever rising rents and as prices rise property prices you're also getting
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.400]   hurt because it costs you more to buy if you ever want to buy the only way to be long real estate
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.880]   not the only way but the main way to be long real estate is to own more than one property
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.040]   that is the way you benefit from real estate appreciation because you can sell your rental
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   property and you can collect rents and so my advice for people is to buy around age 30 or so
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:13.600]   and hopefully you have a stable job and you've found a place you like to live in to get neutral
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.000]   live in it for three to five years love it enjoy it accumulate that other down payment
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.880]   buy another place live in it for three to five years and do that over and over again let's say
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.760]   up to your limit where you can no longer deal with managing tenants and property and that limit is
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.840]   different for everybody and that limit can go higher or lower depending on if you're comfortable
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.320]   hiring a property manager for me i found that that limit was four properties primary residence plus
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.680]   four and that was it and they were all in san francisco so i was highly leveraged san francisco
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.040]   real estate in the economy but after i had my son in 2017 i just didn't want to manage that many
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.800]   properties anymore so i sold one my main one because there's a ton of turnover ton of problems
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:11.200]   and i reinvested about 550 000 of the proceeds into private real estate deals private real estate
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   funds and syndication deals across the heartland of america because i wanted some of the proceeds
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.280]   to continue to be allocated to real estate but i really wanted to take advantage of my investment
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.040]   thesis that i came up with in 2016 which was to invest in the heartland of america thanks to
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.640]   technology and thanks to people wanting to go to lower cost areas of the country to live a better
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.760]   life save money and still make money and that was a great thesis and i got lucky in an unfortunate
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.360]   situation because the pandemic forced millions of people to work from home and so that accelerated
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.960]   that migration and i think that's a multi-decade trend and so my plan is to invest more of my
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:57.520]   capital in my asset allocation framework of 50 to real estate to more private real estate
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.280]   investments in the heartland so i can diversify my real estate portfolio earn more passive income
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.960]   and hopefully higher cap rates higher net rental yields so i can live my life and not have to go
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.920]   back to work so if i want to summarize it it's to get started it's not about buying rental properties
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.600]   as much as it is when you up you know buy a home that works for you and then when you outgrow that
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   home just don't sell it by assuming you have the money for another down payment and turn it into
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.600]   a rental property and it's not assuming it's making uh being proactive and trying to save
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:39.040]   for a down payment for another home and the idea behind this is one you you enjoy your home you
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.840]   know your home the best if you live in it for five years and if you enjoyed it i'm sure other people
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.160]   enjoy it you probably painted do some things to make it nicer and the thing is you're going to
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.480]   get a mortgage that is a primary residence mortgage that is lower than a rental property
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:59.040]   mortgage and you can keep that mortgage once you rent it out you know and that is a strategic
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.600]   advantage of by about 0.25 to 0.5 percent and then you're going to get another primary mortgage to
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.160]   buy other property in five years maybe it's 10 years maybe it takes 10 years and the idea is
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.440]   there's a benefit where you're not only building wealth through real estate you're also using your
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   capital to enjoy a better lifestyle you know most of us are going to be making more money in our
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.160]   careers some of us are going to grow our families and we're going to be able to appreciate the wealth
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.640]   that we're building and that's a win-win scenario which is why i like real estate better than stocks
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.040]   because you're not going to wake up one day seeing your stock go down 35 because it missed quarterly
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.760]   results by three percent right you're going to just enjoy your property and i think the best time
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.440]   to own the nicest house you can afford is when you have the most number of heartbeats in your home
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.480]   and that's usually your kids because that way you can amortize the cost and the pleasure of owning a
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.600]   nicer home across more people and after they're gone it's not like you're going to upgrade to a
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.200]   mega mansion no you're probably going to keep it because it'll feel lonely not having so many people
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.480]   in your house anymore or you might downsize tactical here two things when you get a new
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.520]   mortgage will they take into account the rental income of the house that you haven't started
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.920]   renting yet that's a good question they will hopefully what you're going to do is you're going
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.040]   to sign a lease this is the ideal scenario you sign a lease while you're in the process of buying
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.960]   your other home and that could take one to three months and once you have that rental income they
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.000]   will not account for 100 of the rental income banks will generally account for about 70 of that
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.160]   rental income in terms of their calculation for how much they're going to lend you money for your
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.760]   second third fourth home so take that into consideration because banks will consider okay
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.920]   if you're renting it out you know there's going to be vacancy risk as well so they want to be
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.600]   conservative so they use 70 which i think is fair but i think regular mom and pop landlords
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.360]   can outperform that 70 and probably rent it out for 90 to 95 and then i also know you're a fan
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.520]   of an adjustable rate mortgage does that change with a strategy of turning your past properties
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:16.560]   into rental properties no so i didn't realize this but only about five percent of mortgage holders
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.720]   have adjustable rate mortgages and i've been talking about getting an adjustable rate mortgage
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.880]   since i started in 2009 and since i've been working uh in finance since 2003 well since
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:35.040]   i bought my property in 2003 and the idea is look interest rates and inflation have been coming down
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:42.400]   for 40 years in a row because of technological advances efficiencies learning about past cycles
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.920]   and yes we currently have elevated inflation now due to a global pandemic but you are seeing
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   inflation top tick in july and i think that's going to fade into 2023 it's just the way it is
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.600]   yin yang finance when prices are up demand starts to get destroyed and then we get back to the
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.520]   normal steady state and so the idea with an arm is look you pay a lower rate than a 30 year fixed
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.080]   because of the time value of money if you're borrowing at a shorter fixed rate return the
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.760]   lender will pay you will lend to you at a lower rate and the thing is back in the global financial
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.520]   crisis days the median or the average homeownership tenure was about four and a half five years
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.760]   now the average homeownership tenureship is about 10 to 11 years the idea is you want to max your
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.160]   fixed rate duration of your mortgage with how long you plan to live in your home so to get a 30 year
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   fixed rate mortgage and pay one percent higher interest rate for 30 years doesn't make sense
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.200]   if you're planning on selling your home or refinancing or paying it off in 10 11 years
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:54.000]   so that is the idea to help you save money and not be afraid of taking out an arm because in my in my
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.920]   opinion we're going to be in a long-term low interest rate environment for the rest of our
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.000]   lifetimes so when we bought a home we said we're probably not going to be here more than 10 years
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.200]   let's do a 10-year arm yeah smart we ended up selling that or we moved out we moved to a new
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   home and we're like well we got three years left on the arm if i were to convert that to a rental
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.960]   then i would go back to a point of adjustable rate so if you want to keep something forever
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.160]   and rent it after you live there then you really are more towards the 30-year cycle than the five
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.520]   or 10-year cycle that's true but in a declining interest rate environment over the past 40 years
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.880]   what happens is your arm resets at the same rate or generally lower that is but basically what's
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:39.120]   been happening for 40 years so let's say so i took out a 7-1 arm in 2020 right so people are like oh
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   that was a mistake you could have got a 30-year fix for 30 years and i'm saying it's not a mistake
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.800]   because the 7-1 arm was at 2.125 percent the best 30-year fixed rate i could get was about you know
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:59.600]   2.875 percent maybe or maybe three percent and by 2027 when the arm resets i'm pretty certain that
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.320]   it's going to reset at a same rate or lower because we're going to back down to trend in terms of
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.760]   inflation and interest so when an arm resets it just generally resets back to the same rate or
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.160]   lower over the past 40 years obviously sometimes you can get unlucky but if you believe the trend
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:21.360]   is down or low it'll be fine and an arm people need to understand has a maximum reset rate for
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:29.040]   the first year usually by two percent so my arm rate could go from 2.125 to 4.125 to me it's not
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.400]   a big deal because probably about 20 percent 25 percent of the principal has already been paid
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.440]   down and then the following year it can only go up by a maximum of one percent and there's a
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.840]   lifetime cap to an arm which mine is seven percent which sounds scary but for the first seven years
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.720]   of the arm it was saving you know 0.75 to one percent interest by not getting a 30-year fixed
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.800]   so you're only losing until like maybe year 10 or 11 or 12 and it's not really losing it's just it
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.680]   was a suboptimal decision yeah i built a comparison calculator to try to really dial in and optimize
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.720]   this particular thing and i found that it was about what you just said two to three years till
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:18.640]   the break even point but i think it's rare to have interest rates be elevated at least in my opinion
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.560]   and where we're going for more than a handful of years and so you know i would say if you have a
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.040]   10-year arm and you're seven years into it and rates are low probably a good time to refinance
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.240]   that yeah you can always refinance yeah so i i think one common misconception is you don't have
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.120]   to wait until the end of the 10-year fixed period to do something about it so if you're seven years
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.160]   in and rates are still low maybe refinance then if you're nine years in and rates are really high
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.320]   and you haven't refinanced we'll know that for the next three years you're still going to be
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.120]   breaking even from all the savings and hopefully that over that period of time rates will drop
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.240]   again uh and you'll be able to do something the only other thing you didn't mention is i actually
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.440]   think that in periods right now we have high interest rates we have high inflation but rents
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.600]   are also up and so if you're using your unadjustable rate mortgage for a rental property it's very
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:16.160]   possible that if your interest rates go up because of rates rising it might also be in line with some
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.960]   a situation we have now like inflation where rents are also rising and so you might be able to recoup
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:28.080]   some of that incremental interest cost with higher rents well yeah i mean everybody needs to understand
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:35.680]   uh finance is not in a vacuum it's yin yang finance like inflation is up because the economy
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:41.200]   is great and job market is strong and people are getting paid more and rents are going up
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.880]   and so forth right but there is an inflection point and we need to be aware of that and that
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.160]   inflection point is probably right now and i think inflation is going to go back down
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:58.080]   so we're not helpless animals you know you're right we can refinance before the fixed rate
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.960]   period is over if we're afraid and we want to extend that term or we can sell the property
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.920]   or we can pay down principal so that when we do refinance or when it does reset less of the
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.720]   percentage goes to interest there are so many things we can do and that is a mindset that i
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.440]   want people to get into it's kind of like the debate between you know doing a Roth conversion
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.080]   or not and that is and in the past i was like ah don't do the Roth conversion because you're
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.720]   basically giving up you're paying the government the inefficient government first all the taxes
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:37.040]   and you give up all your basic strategies to lower your taxes in the future such as moving to a low
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:43.360]   cost or low income or no income tax state and so forth but as i've gotten older i see the wisdom
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   in the Roth we can talk about them later but you know that's something people need to think about
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.400]   we are dynamic we can do things to all we always have an opportunity to do things
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.760]   to improve our financial situation so i know i know you've had a lot of success in real estate
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.280]   i also know that you've talked about a vacation property that maybe wasn't the best decision so
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.160]   i'm curious to get your take on vacation properties i think a vacation property is a
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:16.320]   suboptimal use of funds because you're not going to use it enough uh to be able to make it a good
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.960]   financial decision versus you know renting a vrbo or airbnb or whatever to you want to diversify
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.520]   where you vacation if you always go back to the same place over and over again it also gets boring
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.880]   but if you buy a vacation property you're going to feel committed to having to go back to that
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.800]   place to make it worthwhile so i bought a vacation property terrible timing in 2007 because i was
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.320]   making the most money ever and i just got promoted and i thought my income would just go up so the
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:54.000]   number one mistake i made was modeling a high income for a long period of time and then i also
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.120]   thought i got a deal getting it for about 15 off and then it ended up going down another 40 to 50
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:07.440]   so that was a great lesson learned about not forecasting your income extrapolating it so
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.400]   long into the future and also not buying things you really don't need but the good thing about
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:19.440]   this vacation property is that i kept paying the mortgage i paid it off it's paid off and my dream
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.480]   for buying the vacation property was because i took my wife my girlfriend at the time i was on
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.680]   our first date in california to lake tahoe at the resort squaw creek and i decided you know what it
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.400]   was such a special moment i wanted to own that piece of moment and one day maybe we could take
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.120]   our children there and my forecasting for having children was very delayed but we just got back
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.680]   from the vacation property with our two children and they had an amazing time and it was really
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.280]   really a priceless moment and now the vacation property is a very small percentage of my net
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.080]   worth so at the end of the day i think it worked out and are you able to rent it out in the off
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.440]   time something that maybe in 2007 the platforms weren't didn't exist to make it easy but now
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.840]   maybe makes the equation different oh yeah i mean 2007 wasn't the stone ages it was in the
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.600]   rental program at the resort and then after several years i decided to move it out to a
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:22.880]   private rental property manager and that yeah it generates 500 000 bucks a month pretty consistently
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.680]   i mean it's high high season during the summer and in the winters and then really sparse during
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:35.760]   october november so actually it generates passive income but it wasn't a good financial decision at
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.680]   all and it was tough it was like that albatross on my neck for a while like i really had to
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.160]   fight it and get through it um but now it's it's fine it's just it is what it is it's part of the
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.840]   game of you make mon you win some you lose some yeah we recently looked at vacation properties
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:01.440]   in napa and because there just aren't a lot of airbnbs and i ended up we ended up buying a picasso
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.160]   i don't know if you've you've looked at this company it's like a fractional fractional real
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.360]   estate so basically you buy one eighth of a home so imagine it's it's as if eight people came
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.760]   together and bought a home together except you don't they have the marketplace so you don't have
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.960]   to find the other seven um right well i hope you enjoyed uh you'll probably enjoy it more than i
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.160]   enjoyed my lake tahoe property because it's tahoe's uh sonoma napa's hour hour and a half
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.040]   away well it's closer right so hopefully it's an hour and a half away family is nearby and we only
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.160]   we only paid an eighth of it and we only get an eighth of the year which means we only really
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.480]   use six weeks a year but it's more efficient yeah yes it's much more efficient let's turn
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.200]   away from physical real estate and and kind of talk about you know online real estate my web
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.320]   presence my website uh maybe a business i run because i know you've said that people are are
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.920]   quick to have their social media profiles but maybe they don't have this hub in the middle
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.640]   to tie it all together that can help them build something online could you talk a bit about why
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.160]   you think that's important yeah so in the old days 10 20 years ago we would just have a resume
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.120]   that we would submit and you know it would be tossed into the trash right seven seconds people
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   spend on a resume and that's it nowadays everybody googles who you are what you do what you stand for
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:24.080]   what you believe in and so having your website is vital and thinking about your brand is also vital
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.680]   if you want a job if you want to do new things i decided to go with financial samurai.com because
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.160]   i was working in finance when i started the site and i just wanted to have this really cool sounding
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.000]   name i used to live in japan for two three years and my girlfriend and now wife is half japanese
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.600]   and i love it i love the japanese culture and i thought it was great and i think everybody needs
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.640]   to plant their flag on the internet and own their domain instead of letting a social media company
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:39:01.200]   own you look if you write content on twitter facebook whatever they own you they have the
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.280]   content and they're getting rich right you are helping them get rich instead why don't you get
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.640]   yourself rich by planting your own flag branding yourself online and sharing with the world what
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:19.360]   you stand for it's the green marble theory is my my belief that if you have a janky crusted
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:25.120]   green marble if you put it on ebay someone will want to buy it and the reason why is because
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:31.280]   there's something like five six billion people online now and it just it's the law of attraction
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.920]   we're all connected you just have to put yourself out there and good things will happen if you stay
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.560]   the course long enough period of time put another way do you think everyone should kind of write or
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.680]   produce content somewhere on the line and and own the place they do it so they can build an audience
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.840]   or build a business around it well i think you need to it depends on what you want if you want
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:00.000]   to be hired as a consultant or build your business or whatever you should probably be a thought leader
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.840]   and the thing that you care about the most what i've seen it's interesting the the vc community
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.640]   which is it's it's fascinating because i think being a vc is one of the best jobs in the world
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.960]   you invest other people's money you don't have to prove yourself for 10 years because that's the life
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.600]   of the fun and you're just collecting big bucks you know two percent of fees under management and
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.120]   you get a percentage of the profits if it turns out well and what these folks have done it's very
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.800]   competitive to attract capital and get your companies to accept your capital right they've
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   created they've hired thought leaders to write and be on social media and have their websites
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.760]   and write for the vc company's blog every day every week to showcase their knowledge what they're
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:50.160]   doing and their brand because it's so competitive and noisy out that you need to figure out how to
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.560]   make yourself stand out and how to attract the right people that you want for your business
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:01.360]   yeah as a former vc i think if you love that job it's great uh i found that you know at the
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.000]   time in my life and maybe things have changed since then but i was like i really wanted to
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.880]   build products and so as much as it was a great lifestyle uh job right you you're invested like
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.200]   all the things you said i was like i don't want to watch all these people build things i want to
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.320]   build them so i'll just caveat that like it sounds as it's glamorous yes you can make a lot of money
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.840]   but at the end of the day if if what you love is actually you know building the thing and not
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.640]   supporting those doing it it might not be the most fulfilling career even if you make a lot of money
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.520]   i think that's really admirable that you left the cushy vc job to actually try to build something
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.200]   and then actually successfully sell it i mean that's amazing to me and what i find amazing
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   is that there are vcs who have no building experience they don't know how to operate
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:55.200]   a company or start a company and that's kind of amazing to me because as an entrepreneur you're
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:01.120]   hopefully leaning on their expertise and experience but it also shows that you can do anything you
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:07.040]   want uh the world is your oyster so whether you have any experience or nothing and you just went
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.480]   to business school and you know learn case studies you can be a vc too awesome it's funny because i
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:18.400]   think one of the reasons that i left being a vc was that i i kind of had this feeling of imposter
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.880]   syndrome because i hadn't actually built and grown and scaled a company uh like you mentioned however
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:31.520]   i now look back and realize that those two skill sets are incredibly different and the skill set of
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.280]   a vc is actually much more in line with the skill set of a professional investor than with an
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.920]   entrepreneur and or a manager or a ceo and so i think at one point in my career i thought i couldn't
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.000]   be a vc because i've never built a company now that i've built a company i'm like i couldn't be
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   a vc because i don't want to be a professional investor and um my former manager uh or andy
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.800]   racliffe who started wealthfront who i sold my last company to told me he said when someone asked
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.440]   him should i be a vc he says well do you like to invest in stocks on your own do you like to pick
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   stocks in your brokerage account and if you don't you maybe ask yourself do you really like investing
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:15.120]   and i always thought that was strange because i always thought of vc as like the second you know
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.160]   career of an entrepreneur and as you look as i looked deeper and deeper at some of the most
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.840]   successful venture capitalists of all time many of them were not entrepreneurs uh many of them are
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:31.120]   much more adept at picking companies evaluating businesses than they necessarily were at starting
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.400]   them but boy did i think that was my my flaw that's why i thought i couldn't be a vc in the
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:43.600]   first place so um i've evolved that position over over time but you know you mentioned putting up
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.720]   something online starting to write people some people in the world will find it and if they do
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.120]   you know you can have a business you can also start side hustles one of the things that i've
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.920]   really appreciated on your site that i would love to talk a little bit about is some of the kind of
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.520]   personal and and financial and maybe tax benefits of running a business because something i've
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.680]   learned with this podcast is that when you're employed you know you you know your salary
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.960]   and then you usually know what gets deposited in your bank account and at the end of the year you
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   might owe some taxes or not but it's a pretty straightforward equation but when you run a
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   business it's actually really confusing because there are a lot of things that might be deductible
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.160]   that maybe work when you worked at a company so you actually maybe you don't make that much money
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.880]   but a lot of the things you spend your money on are less expensive you've written on your
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.480]   site about how vacations can be free if you talk about the vacation how uh you know your car can
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.120]   be depreciated as a business expense you talk a little bit about some of the exciting things
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:49.840]   maybe not those two that running a business can afford you also the idea i had a decision 10 years
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.600]   ago to run a lifestyle business or try to blow it up and take funding and you know run a big
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.960]   business and try to make mega millions and at the poker table i decided with my friends who are all
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.280]   trying to make the mega millions that i would run a lifestyle business because i just got out of
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.680]   banking and i wanted a better lifestyle so to go back and try to kill myself to write a you know
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.880]   run a business to make a lot of money it was just totally the antithesis of what i wanted to do and
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.520]   so the idea is with a lifestyle business or just with a business in general you want to think about
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:26.320]   those expenses that are personal expenses that also overlap with your business right so those
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:33.120]   things include internet costs you need internet to run your business your iphone you need or
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.720]   whatever your mobile phone to run your business the monthly subscription on on that you have to
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.960]   have a board meeting every single year for your business i think that's the the rule you don't
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:48.480]   have to have it in your mom's basement you know with free water you can go to hawaii or wherever
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.600]   you want with your consultants uh your editor whatever it is you know you can pay for their
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.640]   fair and have your board meeting there at something you know somewhere more pleasurable
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.320]   and so the idea is identify those crossover points where you need them for your personal life anyway
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:10.800]   and your business and that is where you can probably write off a lot of your expenses but
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.240]   of course i'm not a cpa so ask your cpa but the worst thing that can happen is not like you're
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:22.000]   going to get thrown in jail there's like 70 000 pages on the tax documents in america we make
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.560]   mistakes all the time the worst case is you know you're going to get a letter and say you know this
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.800]   you actually did this wrong you got to pay this because you didn't pay it and maybe you have to
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:36.560]   pay like a five percent penalty fee per year for example so that's something that people need to
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.040]   understand it's not like the movies where you're just thrown in jail and your life is over people
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:46.480]   are trying to figure out things on their own and you know the irs they're actually hopefully good
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.600]   people they're good people because they're trying to clarify and simplify and explain
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   their convoluted tax laws it's crazy but that's that's my thoughts in general yeah and i would
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.880]   say you you don't have i wouldn't go and just like expense everything and and hope that it'll work i
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.760]   but i do think there are a lot of things if if there's a gray area and you're not sure the worst
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.000]   case isn't as bad as you might think um yeah what about a couple tactical questions now that i'm
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.040]   over here running a company uh on my own what do you do what what was your choice for your business
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.960]   when it comes to retirement plans how do you do that on a personal level with your business so
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.880]   we have uh the sep sep ira plan and basically you can contribute i think it's up to 25 of operating
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:43.280]   profits operating profits not revenue not net profits operating profits to the sep ira plan for
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:49.920]   yourself and your employees so it's just my wife and me and what i also did for when i had more
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.840]   time before my son was born was i did some freelancing consulting whatever rideshare
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:01.600]   stuff just any stuff that i could make money so i created a solo 401k as well and so i was
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.560]   able to contribute to my solo 401k and get the sep ira plan going and what people don't realize
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:15.040]   or some people don't realize as employees is the maximum 401k contribution is not just 20,500 per
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.960]   employee in 2022 it's actually way more i forgot the exact number but it's something like 60,000
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:26.720]   plus we can look it up but the employer can contribute even more than the maximum the
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.440]   employee contribute through profit sharing and so that's something you got to think about before
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:38.960]   you quit your job or join a startup or whatever what is that 401k match because it's often not
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.920]   just three percent or five thousand dollars or whatever it could be tens of thousands of dollars
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:49.440]   if your employer is really on good financial footing and is really providing a lot of
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:56.000]   benefits to their employees yeah i think something to just keep in mind is that if you were able to
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.920]   on a freelance or self-employed basis make maybe 10 less than your work salary because of some of
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:10.160]   these benefits maybe better retirement contributions maybe more efficient business deductions you know
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.360]   you might actually be able to get by on less income than you would not to mention if you move
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.400]   to a lower cost of living area you could definitely get by on less income one area that i want your
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.560]   take on is on health insurance because that's one expense that you're going to have to pay on your
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:30.400]   own for people worried about what that means leaving their job and starting a company and
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.720]   having to cover their own health insurance how have you approached that there are a couple ways
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.440]   to approach it but what we did was we sucked it up and we decided to pay 100 of our health care
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:48.480]   insurance we got a platinum plan for the for the family of three once my wife left her job in 2015
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.560]   as well she engineered her layoff as well at 34 and a half and we paid full freight which was 1800
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   18 to 1900 a month at the time and now with a family with two kids we pay about 2300 a month
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.440]   for a gold plan and so we are not getting any subsidies and i think it's fine we we don't need
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.720]   any subsidies but strategically if you want to get subsidies from the government you would have
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:21.520]   to earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty limit per household size so for example
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.360]   the federal poverty limit for one person is something around two thousand seven hundred
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:32.560]   dollars to thirteen thousand dollars so if you can make as close to that as possible then you will
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:38.880]   get as much health insurance subsidy as possible so this is why you hear a lot of multi-millionaires
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.800]   let's say you know you have two or three million dollars that generate and you have household of
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:49.200]   four and your investments let's say three million generates sixty seventy thousand dollars of income
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.120]   you can get health care subsidies as a multi-millionaire technically and that's
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.800]   actually what a lot of people do now whether that is going with the spirit of the intention
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.440]   of the subsidies is another matter but what we did we pay full freight but it's a business expense
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:11.840]   right so if we have a 20 marginal income tax rate it's twenty three hundred dollars a month
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:17.040]   technically minus twenty percent and that's our expense so i don't think i even knew that that
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.400]   was a business expense uh so that's a interesting thing and you your wife works at the company too
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:28.000]   can you talk a little bit about managing finances with a couple bringing them into the business
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.800]   i think there's a couple places to take that but i know you you have a few unique opinions on
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.960]   managing finances with your partner yeah i think if you love your partner you should strive to make
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.440]   them financially independent of you right because financial dependence i think is one of the worst
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.640]   things because we're all adults here your partner you you had a life before you met each other
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:57.840]   and i feel that a lot of fights uh with your partner can be due to money that's top three
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.080]   reason and so having financial independence with your partner and having your own bank accounts
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.200]   separate accounts actually is like a release valve for stress that if money becomes an issue
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.680]   you can just oh i'm gonna go spend my own money it's okay so that's one of my philosophies make
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.040]   your partner financially independent if you really love them now a lot of people are against that
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.640]   they say oh we're a one team everything is great we're never gonna divorce yada yada yada okay
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:30.240]   that's great to do what you want but this is my philosophy uh in terms of bringing her on the fold
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:36.400]   um once i helped her engineer her layoff and get a severance in 2015 because we had a pact if i
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:42.000]   was able to negotiate a severance at 34 and a half and leave she's three years younger than me i said
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.440]   you too can negotiate a severance when you're 34 35 and come join me if everything you know works
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:53.200]   out great and so everything did work out fine and so i helped her negotiate a severance and
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.440]   we ended up you know incorporating financial samurai and we have our little business and the
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.600]   idea is look we're we are a team i do the front end i do the writing and she does the editing
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.760]   and she does um the filing of the taxes and that's how it goes and we pay ourselves a salary um
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.320]   and it's an equal salary and we just treat it as a fun lifestyle business it really is like
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.400]   we can't believe that there's actually income coming in from what we would do for free it's
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   just fun and if you look at articles on financial samurai it's storytelling it's talking about
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.640]   difficult situations it's not seo optimized affiliate post after affiliate post like a lot
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.840]   of you know sites can do and we could do that too but it's just so soul-sucking that we just
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:45.760]   want to write stories and tell tell what's going on in our lives one thing that i think is very rare
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.720]   is that in this space so many people who are in the financial independence route who've quit their
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:57.520]   job and can work from anywhere end up moving to low cost of living places yet you're still in
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.360]   where i am the bay area you know not a state with the highest income taxes um you know maybe in the
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.560]   country what do you say to people that think you're crazy for staying here when you could
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:15.520]   live anywhere why do i say well i grew up overseas for 13 years six different countries i've been to
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:21.280]   60 countries i've lived on the east coast i've been to the midwest many many times for business
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   and i've lived in san francisco for 20 years now more than 21 years and i say i love the san
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.880]   francisco bay area it's beautiful there's a lot of culture the food is amazing it's perennially
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.800]   ranked top two in the country i can fly to hawaii if i want to there's tremendous amount of job
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:44.000]   opportunities consulting opportunities and i get to look at the ocean every single day out of my
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.440]   house on all three levels and i feel great and so yeah there's a price to pay for that and that is
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.320]   the median home price in san francisco is 1.8 million uh and the reason why the median home
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.600]   price is 1.8 million is because you have 24 year old engineers who are making 200 to 300 thousand
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.680]   dollars a couple years out of college everything is rational the media forgets that the opportunity
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   of each city is what drives the cost not the other way around and so for much of my life especially
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:18.000]   after i left in 2012 i just thought wow there's so much opportunity uh yes it's expensive but
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.960]   you know there's consulting here there's a meetup here i mean it's just so fun and it's beautiful
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:30.400]   it's not like look i know the media likes to focus on the one street in the worst neighborhood in san
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.480]   francisco and blow it up i mean it's really good media you know they're really smart about that
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.760]   but if you actually come to san francisco it's an amazing city and i've been everywhere and so
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   i could have done hawaii honolulu is my second favorite city but it's very expensive in hawaii
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.520]   and adjusted for the income opportunity or the fun things you can do it's a little bit too
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:58.000]   expensive actually um in my mind as someone who also lives in the bay area i i share a similar
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.640]   sentiment not that you know my wife and i both work for a company that we could be remote right now
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   a podcast i could do from anywhere but i tend to think that money's purpose is is like we said at
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:15.280]   the beginning at all and we love living here the opportunities here are great and you know for us
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:21.360]   it's not yes we could save more money somewhere else but if money's goal is to allow you to do
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:27.120]   things you love then that's we're using it right now to spend more to stay here i mean i understand
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:33.360]   the hatred against san francisco because if you can't comfortably afford to live in a place
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.440]   you might hate it right it's just logical you gotta like shack up with a roommate when you're
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.640]   40 years old you can't eat what you want or go what you want it's natural and i understand that
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:49.440]   and what i've also noticed is that we tend to accumulate the amount of wealth that will enable
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.480]   us to afford to live in a place we want to live so if i didn't live in san francisco and if i lived
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:01.520]   in let's say austin uh i would probably just work as hard as i could to make enough money to cover
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.360]   my expenses in austin where the median home price is let's say five hundred thousand or six hundred
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:10.400]   thousand and be comfortable with that but i like a challenge and it's really fun i have my friends
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:15.200]   here i have my network here i play tennis i just got back from playing tennis earlier before this
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   podcast and it's just you are where your friends and family are i love it here uh so i don't see
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:26.560]   moving anytime soon but speaking of travel and moving and going to other places i know before
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.760]   kids and the pandemic you did a lot of traveling and a lot of the conversations we have about
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:37.360]   travel and i know a lot of our listeners are just now having built up a lot of big balance of points
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.720]   and getting past the pandemic thinking about where to go i'm curious if you have any suggestions from
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.600]   all the travels you've done of where people might want to take a trip to or check out something that
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:57.040]   maybe is not the obvious place oh man my favorite place is malaysia because i also grew up there in
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:02.960]   my middle school teenage years and that was like exciting the food is the best top three in the
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.360]   world it's very inexpensive i love angkor wat cambodia it's so hot it's like 95 degrees and
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:16.560]   humid but the temples are unbelievable i love southeast asia southeast asia is a great great
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:22.960]   region friendly people people speak english the food is amazing and the cost of living is low so
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.480]   i love that i went to europe probably 20 to 20 different countries in europe i love it as well
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:36.240]   i love the lifestyle the attitude of living not for work but living for living's sake it's just
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.040]   that one of those things where after you see like five gothic churches they all start looking the
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:48.720]   same so i i enjoyed mallorca spain mallorca was amazing the spanish culture you eat tapas at 10
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:56.240]   pm you enjoy life the water the beaches so and then amsterdam amsterdam is kind of like the san
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:02.560]   francisco of europe where people are pretty chill you know weed is available everywhere
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.760]   and there's really diverse culture and i love amsterdam as well i haven't been to mallorca
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:12.880]   amsterdam's amazing i want to come back to malaysia because i think it's a country having
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:19.280]   been there i i don't often hear a lot of other people go there that don't have some family there
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   or some business reason to be there so if someone's thinking right now listening to this saying
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.760]   i'm malaysia i've never really thought about going there what would you tell them to think about as
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.920]   a trip not you don't need to plan a whole week or two itinerary but what are a few highlights of
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.720]   something they should do other than my favorite is just eat all the roti canai you can find on
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:41.440]   the street that would be like my path uh but what would you tell someone to think about as a they
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:48.080]   plan a trip well malaysia you know it's it's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:56.320]   and the beauty is uh the food is amazing right uh the mamak stalls the roti canai um the milk
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.440]   fish the chicken fish all that stuff the ganguk belacan gotta check that out you can go to
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.960]   kuala lumpur for sure you know see the palace see the batu caves go on these excursions but go
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:17.040]   to the pulau which are the islands um on the east and west and or go to penang and see the turquoise
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:24.320]   water and go scuba diving uh 70 feet down and still see the water and have nobody around you
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.800]   my favorite uh trip was to this resort called the tara's resort it's an island and there's
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.440]   an island on the east side and we just had it was kind of like you know the movie the beach
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.800]   i think it was the beach with leonardo dicaprio it was kind of like that you would take a dinghy
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.160]   out you'd go scuba diving you'd come to this cove there'd be some little sharks around turquoise
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.200]   water and it was just unbelievable believable so it's the tara's resort i would check that out
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.000]   awesome yeah i i don't feel like i gave malaysia its justice on our trip it was part of our eight
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.920]   month backpacking trip around the world and uh but it was it was awesome the only thing i don't
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.400]   know if this is still the case but the one thing i remember very specifically because it was a big
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:16.320]   problem was that the atms in malaysia would not accept any of my two or three american bank cards
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.200]   and so we showed up in malaysia with probably seven dollars in cash and went to the atm and
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:30.480]   it didn't work and we could not get cash so how'd you get the cash so i ended up going online and
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.600]   finding some local community in the tech community so there was these events called
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.400]   bar camp which are like unconferences that i'd gotten to know and i just went like koala lumpur
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.480]   bar camp emailed the list serve and was like can anyone here meet me in koala lumpur and i can pay
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.760]   pal you money and you can bring me cash but my new plan is never go to a country uh without at least
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.960]   like maybe a hundred dollars of cash we literally probably had like seven dollars which could get
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:07.360]   you a lot farther in malaysia than i imagined but not too far but not too far wow okay well uh yeah
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.320]   so yeah bring cash and again the the terrace beach and spa was on redang island redang island so
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.120]   awesome i also want to talk a little about parenting we've we've kind of hit on it a little
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.480]   bit here and there but we haven't gone deep i know not everyone in this uh conversation listening has
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.240]   children but you've written so much about it i'm at home with a two-year-old and a two-month-old
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.640]   and it's been top of mind for i don't know the last two and a half years and there are a bunch
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   of decisions that have to be made that you highlight in the book i'd love to just run
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:45.680]   through a few things get your perspective and see where it goes sure uh by this not that half of it
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   is about making optimal decisions with some of the most important things that most of us will face
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.240]   so ask away the the first thing that i just thought was really surprising was a post you
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.960]   wrote about how the financial benefits of kids and i know that one of the conversations that
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.400]   you've probably had with plenty of people when they're talking about kids is ah kids are so
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.440]   expensive and you actually wrote a little bit about the fact that maybe they're not as as
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.520]   expensive as you think because of the way they change your life the issue is uh yes there's
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.880]   studies that say kids are going to cost 250 grand through 18 years old and then obviously college is
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.400]   crazy expensive and the problem is parents we parents want the best for our children uh we love
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.440]   them more than anything else in the world so we're willing to be priced inelastic and spend as much
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:38.320]   money on education or toys or reading materials or whatever right however you know they don't
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:45.760]   have to be as expensive as you you know read about and think about if you can allocate more time to
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.920]   them so that's one of the things that i've discovered and talking to a lot of parents is
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.760]   the parents who are working all day all night and don't spend a lot of time with their kids
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.840]   have this proclivity to try to spend more money on their kids to try to make up for that lost time
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.320]   but if you can find yourself spending more time with them more than the average
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.920]   parent who spends time with their child which is about 120 minutes a day if you have a college
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.880]   education you will find that you don't need to spend as much time as you think as much money
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.800]   as you think because you are having so much fun playing and doing things that require no money
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.320]   at all and the same is true with vacations i know you mentioned that before you had kids you know is
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.840]   always the vacation concept was a big lavish international trip and recently with kids i
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.720]   know you haven't been traveling internationally as much and so i know that's one cost that came
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.520]   down are there other things that you now spend less on because you have kids yeah i mean definitely
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.960]   we're not traveling on by plane anymore because it's such a painful experience with young children
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.240]   under five you know they won't be able to sleep well they you know they might cry what if the
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.080]   plane is delayed by three hours and you got a one-year-old or two-year-old that would be like
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.400]   a disaster it's kind of like losing the lottery um so we've done a lot of staycations uh tahoe
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:12.160]   sonoma napa and as a result we've been to explore the great northern california region so that saved
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:18.640]   us a lot of money now what else have we what else have we saved money on with regards to children
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.560]   i mean we don't go out to eat a lot uh you know we're we're you're filling we have an au pair so
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.880]   we're filling five mouths now or i guess four because the the youngest isn't eating but we're
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.840]   filling four mouths and and so it's just easier to cook we have dinner early so for us we've saved a
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:39.200]   lot of money not going out to dinner all the time which pre-kids was a much more common occurrence
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:45.360]   yeah so yeah less going out um learning how to cook more and cooking more those are definitely
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:52.480]   things and just appreciating and utilizing uh nature around us you know we would go for hikes
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.680]   we'd teach them about rocks and trees and deciduous trees and evergreen trees and just appreciating
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.320]   all the free things around that maybe we didn't appreciate before because we know about it already
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.880]   we we you know as adults we learn about everything and now we got to spend money to try to entertain
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.000]   ourselves but for children everything is new everything is a learning experience and i think
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.080]   it's been pretty wonderful in that regard i mean you also mentioned the the rising cost of education
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.680]   i'm curious how you've thought about approaching 529 savings for college how much to put in there
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:33.440]   and and all of that so i think the rising cost of tuition that is rising faster than the rate
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.040]   of inflation is kind of a racket and it's kind of a racket because colleges don't guarantee
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.080]   any graduate a job right if they grad if they guaranteed a minimum paying job then it wouldn't
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.880]   be a racket but i think you know charging seven eight percent ten percent every single year forever
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.640]   while everything online is for free you can learn everything right youtube blog posts uh you know
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:00.080]   even like the college lectures they put online so why are we spending so much money on tuition
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.920]   and why are colleges these great colleges still only accepting a same level number of people
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.720]   if they really want to educate and help humanity right there they have a different motive they want
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   to keep their status keep their eliteness all that stuff and keep people out that's my cynical view
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:24.400]   but i think that's the realistic view as to why things have not changed in terms of tuition and
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.320]   acceptance rates uh in terms of 529 plan unfortunately you know we have to think about
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.920]   our children and play this game because education is the most important thing we can provide our
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   children if you're educated you can have the courage to take risks do things to make you money
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.800]   and live a better life so for 529 plan i think it's a no-brainer to contribute to it we have
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:54.400]   super funded our child's children's 41529 plans the year they were born and so we can't fund it
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:00.320]   for another five years and if we over fund it it's fine because you can just write a different
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.680]   person's name as the beneficiary right if your child ends up being a genius gets a grant scholarship
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.080]   and all that and you don't you know you got a hundred thousand left over just change the name
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.160]   change it back to yourself change it to your nephew niece aunt wants to do graduate school whatever
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.760]   529 plan is one of the best ways to transfer wealth in a responsible way instead of just
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   giving money to transfer wealth for the use of education i'll actually say there's a great hack
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.280]   which is if you get a scholarship you're actually allowed to fee free take the money out uh that was
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:39.680]   given as a scholarship so um you know if you don't have anyone other siblings other you know people
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.560]   you want to give the money to you can actually take it out in that circumstance um how have you
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.880]   thought about you know living in san francisco i know this is a topic in the book that i was
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.760]   excited to read public versus private school and spending money for education um when there
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.400]   is public education as well i went to public school uh through high school well no high school
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.640]   college graduate school all public school i went to international private schools when i was
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   in the foreign service in malaysia taiwan philippines and zambia so i have um a ratio
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.360]   it's that you can go to private school if it fits your kids needs if the net tuition
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.160]   of one child um if your gross income is equal to at least seven times the net
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:36.080]   tuition of one child so in other words if the tuition net tuition costs 20 000 you got to make
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:43.360]   at least 140 000 to be okay sending your child to private school because remember your goal is
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.320]   to also put your oxygen mask on first and save and invest for your retirement as well
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:54.480]   and it used to be the multiple is more like five times but i've upped it to six to seven
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.640]   it might continue to go up because i feel that education is more and more free and accessible
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.920]   to everyone therefore the idea of spending more and more money on private school just doesn't
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   make sense because after let's say you send your kid from private school from kindergarten through
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:18.080]   four years of college it's about 780 000 without any returns here in san francisco just for normal
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.920]   private schools and college if you slap on a four percent rate of return which is pretty reasonable
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.600]   and pretty achievable it's like 1.1 million dollars that you're going to spend so think about
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.840]   it from your child's perspective who doesn't know better but who will know better based on your
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:40.480]   tutelage would they rather go to public school and have a check for 1.1 million dollars when they
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.120]   graduate from college or you know farmed out over you know a five-year period so they don't spend
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.600]   all their money and go crazy or would they rather go to private school ask your children that give
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.360]   them that dilemma and then also ask yourself what you can do in terms of accelerating your retirement
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.960]   if you had 1 million dollars more as well so those are my thoughts i think it's not the
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.880]   end-all be-all whether you go to private school public school i think what's most important is
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.400]   that you develop your social skills communication skills and actual practical knowledge so that you
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.320]   can get a good job or start your own business yeah i love how in the book you take questions
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.200]   like this and you help approach the average person on how to think about them from both sides so
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.400]   i definitely think anyone listening should check it out it's linked in the show notes so you can
