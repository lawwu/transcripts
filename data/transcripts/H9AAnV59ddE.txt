[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls 6 is coming out, but are not going to tell
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.320]   me.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   The following is a conversation with Todd Howard, one of the greatest video game designers
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   of all time.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.720]   He has led the development of the Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls series, including
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.640]   Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and the future Elder Scrolls 6, and a totally
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.720]   new world in an upcoming game called Starfield.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.160]   Many of these have won Game of the Year awards and have been some of the most celebrated
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.760]   and impactful games ever made.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.700]   To me, Skyrim is quite possibly the greatest game ever.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.480]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.880]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.400]   And now, dear friends, here's Todd Howard.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.720]   Is it possible that we are currently living inside a video game that the future you designed,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   can you give hints as to how one would escape if this was a video game?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.920]   How can a video game character escape to outside the video game?
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.440]   Are these things you don't consider when you design a game?
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.880]   Actually we do, because in the kind of games that we make, we want it to be as open as
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880]   possible.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.360]   So when you start a game, you're always testing it.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   What can I do?
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.600]   What would the game allow me to do?
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   And you check everything.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.640]   You try to pick up the mugs, you try every door, you collide with everything, like, hey,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.440]   what are the rules of this world?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.800]   We try to do games where we say yes as much as possible.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   That leads to some level of chaos.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.680]   But if you were stuck in a video game, you would try everything.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.240]   And usually you're going to find a door or a space where the designers didn't anticipate
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.000]   you piling all those crates up and getting over a wall that they didn't expect.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.800]   Right, so it's not a designed doorway out, it's an accidental, unintended doorway out.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.040]   It's a happy bug.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   You could like Truman Show, just get in the ocean and go until it's stuck.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240]   It keeps going.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240]   Right, right.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   It keeps going.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.000]   The more realistic the game becomes, the harder it is to find that door.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.960]   The bigger the world, the bigger the open world.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   And then as we do it, we learn they're going to find a way.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.720]   So just don't try to pen them in.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   Usually we leave like this developer test cell area in the game that we don't anticipate
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   anyone will find.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.960]   And they ultimately find it.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   It has crates of all the weapons in the game and things like that.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.840]   The little hints you drop now will just drive people mad, which is something I enjoy deeply.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.880]   So Skyrim NPCs have at times hilarious dialogue.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.080]   What does it take to build a good NPC dialogue?
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.960]   The main thing is to make them reactive.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   A lot of times when you write characters for movies or things like that, you want to make
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.760]   that character interesting for themselves, right?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.960]   What's their story?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.240]   And there's some characters like that that the player definitely cares about.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.120]   But the best characters are the ones that react to you.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.700]   So you'll find a lot of people love our guards.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.320]   And the guards are written almost purely to be reactive.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   Hey, nice tie.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   I like your jacket.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   Do this cool watch.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.400]   You know, hey, what'd you do?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   And so that, hey, you're the man as you walk by.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.080]   That makes them interesting.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.280]   Or the way they react to something that you do.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.480]   Lydia in Skyrim, who everybody loves, I'm sworn to carry your burdens.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.520]   That's a generic line that all of the House Carls have.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.420]   And it just kind of lands when she says it.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.960]   Why does it land?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   And did you anticipate it would land?
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.160]   There's a slight snarkiness in that particular read of it.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.320]   And you're asking her to do something.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.600]   And she's reacting to you.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:24.000]   What about the trade-off between maybe the randomness and the scripted nature of the
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   dialogue?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.680]   Like, is there any room for randomness of the dialogue tree?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.880]   We tend to write them in stacks.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.280]   It's a very small-- think of it as a small state machine that just says, OK, this is
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.640]   what's happening.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.760]   Here's a random list of things I could say to that.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.360]   And then some of that plays out in ways you don't anticipate.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   But we look at the things.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.600]   What are the players doing that we could have the characters respond to that they don't
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   expect?
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.040]   You know, jumping on tables or stealing stuff or sneaking in in the middle of the night
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   or those kind of things.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:12.000]   The more of that we can do, the more reactive and interesting the characters appear.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.120]   And these state machines, how big are these things?
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.040]   Are these individual to the individual characters?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.800]   It's just fascinating how you design state machines.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   Is it just a giant database?
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.920]   I would think of the AI as one big one.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   For sort of everybody.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.160]   So there's an AI--
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.400]   There's a manager for all the people.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   And one of the things--
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   It's the people manager.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   Right, right.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   Nice.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.680]   One of the things that makes what we do particularly unique is-- and this is a trade-off for what
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.920]   people are seeing, because a lot of it's not on the screen.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   But we're using cycles to run this, which is we're thinking about everybody in the whole
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   world all the time.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.800]   The ones that are further away at a much less tick rate, they go into low.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.040]   But we know if they want to walk across the world.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.160]   And we're running every quest at the same time.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.000]   Whereas in other open world games, you start an activity, the rest of the world is going
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.840]   to shut down so that they can really make that as impactful.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.560]   I really prefer that the rest of it's going on.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.080]   It's more of a simulation that we're building.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.880]   So when those things collide, that's where it gets the most interesting.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.920]   And so we're running all of those people and understanding where they want to go and their
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.360]   cycles and what they want to do.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.080]   And the ones that are closer to you, we just update a lot more.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.840]   It's one way to think about it.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.760]   I mean, that's really fascinating.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.520]   It's something that people had-- they were wondering about to what degree it's possible
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.160]   to run the world without you.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.400]   So there is a feeling to role-playing games that you're the central, you're at the center
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.200]   of the world and the whole world rotates around you.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.680]   As it does in normal life.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   Like when we walk around, there's a-- when you forget yourself, you start to take yourself
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   very seriously.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.080]   Like you are the center of the world.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   You forget that there's 8 billion people on earth and you forget that they have lives.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.520]   That's actually a sobering realization that they all have really interesting life stories
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.400]   and they have their worries, they suffer in different complicated ways.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.360]   And yet, when you play a role-playing game, there's a-- I mean, both computationally and
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.000]   from a storytelling perspective, you wonder if the world goes on without you.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.280]   Like if you come back, if you take a break and you come back, is there still a bustling
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.520]   town that now has a history since you have last visited?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.400]   So to what degree can you create a world that goes on without you?
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   Or goes on at the same time as you do your thing, whatever the heck you're doing?
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.920]   We don't prioritize the stuff you can't see.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.120]   So it's more like an amusement park.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.040]   If you study like the design, our level designers did this, how do they build Disney World in
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   these places?
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.060]   So it still exists for you, the player.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.440]   So it is fairly, you know, when you're going to come in, this is what you're going to see,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.520]   the shops are in the front, you're going to do this.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   It's just for us to make it far more believable and get some more emergent behavior that not
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.800]   just make that sort of the verisimilitude of what you're in for that moment, but you
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   buy it all.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.400]   I always say like, you know, we got to do the little things so that you buy the reality
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.760]   of the virtual world you're in.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.360]   So we want to do something crazy, you know, when a dragon lands or a death law comes out
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.080]   of the wasteland or those kinds of things that you, it has the impact to you as the
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.760]   viewer that it would to the people in the world.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.360]   Okay.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   But still you're simulating stuff that's close to you.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   It is a bit of a simulation going on.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   Yes.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.280]   And so that creates some interesting dynamics then.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.080]   And the stuff that we're looking at in the future, you know, our plan is to push that
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:14.560]   even more to think about how these things exist in the world first.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.040]   And we do some of this, but even more so in the future to say, how do these things exist?
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.000]   Take like a faction in the world.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.320]   What is their role in the world as opposed to just their role is for the player to join
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.040]   it, go through a bunch of quests and become the head of the faction.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.260]   You know, think a little bit deeper about the simulation and what would the mage's guild
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:42.960]   be doing in a fantasy world or the fighter's guild be doing in a fantasy world versus just
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.760]   sign up, do quests, get gold.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.580]   And so that when you show up to that mage's guild, it's a bustling guild full of stuff
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   going on.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.460]   It's not just that it's bustling is that they feel rooted in it.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.640]   They don't feel like a storefront for come here, do quests, get experience.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.900]   Is that one of the essential components of randomly generated worlds?
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:14.240]   So when I think back to Daggerfall as gigantic world, when I first played it, I thought like,
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.840]   I mean, you're just struck by the immensity of it.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   The immensity of the possibility.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.720]   When you're young and you look into your future, it's wide open and you can do anything.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.840]   And that's what Daggerfall felt like.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.440]   The openness was gigantic.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.760]   And Daggerfall is interesting coming off Arena where Arena does the same thing, but Daggerfall
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:47.960]   in many ways is bigger despite focusing on an area because of how the density of, okay,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   this is how much physical game space we'll do for these villages and towns.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:59.200]   And it does feel endless, even though you're looking at a map that has constraints.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.840]   And Daggerfall actually was a touchstone for us going into Starfield for how we do the
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:14.400]   planets because there's a different kind of gameplay experience when you just wander outside
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.680]   a city in Daggerfall.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.680]   Then follow a quest line and go to this place and it's completely handcrafted and everything
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.840]   around every corner we've kind of placed like Skyrim.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.560]   Starfield's a bit more like Daggerfall in that if you wander outside the city, we're
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.800]   going to be generating things and you kind of get used to that game flow, different than
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.400]   we've done before and fun in a different kind of way.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   We'll talk about Starfield.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.600]   So just for people who don't know, and how dare you for not knowing, but with Daggerfall
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.720]   we're talking about the Elder Scrolls series that started, so we're talking about the big
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.680]   titles within the series, started with Arena in '94, Daggerfall in '96.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.520]   I didn't look up the years before this, this is depressing or awesome.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.980]   So all of these games brought hundreds, probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.980]   for me.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.320]   So Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.480]   So I don't remember Arena being that open world.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.500]   Well, it's all the provinces.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.920]   It follows kind of the same pattern.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.680]   It just doesn't have all the number of villages and places that Daggerfall has while Daggerfall
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.760]   focuses on the Iliac Bay area.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   Arena does it all.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.400]   It just changes the scale in terms of one block on the map equals this much space.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.140]   There is something that, I mean, I'm speaking to anecdotal experience, but I just remember
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.420]   it feeling wide open, Daggerfall.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   It definitely was, yes.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.040]   In the way Arena didn't.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:59.360]   I don't remember, maybe because Arena, it was so cool to have just the role playing
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.780]   game aspect.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.580]   You're focused on the items and the character development.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.540]   Daggerfall has a lot more depth, particularly in the character system.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.060]   That's what it introduces, all of the skills and those kinds of things.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.780]   Arena, it's actually, it's a game I love.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.660]   And it's very, very elegant if you look at the first one where it's just an XP based
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.740]   system, do this, get XP, level up.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.940]   Very classic role playing game.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.380]   Daggerfall digs deep into who's your character, how you're going to develop it, what are
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.140]   your skills, there's advantages, there's disadvantages.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.260]   And the environment going full 3D from Arena, which is actually like a two and a half D
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:48.460]   Doom style engine, I agree with you that Daggerfall feels like there's more possibilities when
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.460]   you're playing it.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.100]   Were you able to look up to the sky in Daggerfall?
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   Yep.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.100]   My memory is...
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.100]   It's full 3D, yeah.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   So that's what full 3D means.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.260]   And then you can go outside the city?
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.260]   You can walk outside the city.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.500]   You can do that in Arena too, but it looks more fakie, right?
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.700]   It's all going to be a flat plane.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.740]   Here comes things and then a dungeon entrance is an 8-bit, here comes a little flat coming
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.220]   at the camera.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:17.900]   So before we go to the end and the middle, so from Starfield to Fallout and the Elder
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.620]   Scrolls series, let's go to the very beginning.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.300]   What's the origin story?
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.020]   You know what, let's even go before then.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:30.300]   What's the first time you remember the thing that made you fall in love with video games?
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:38.140]   Well, I think it's partly my age coming up with the arcades and playing Space Invaders
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.540]   at the pizza place and then Pac-Man really...
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.220]   It's interesting about video games and what Pac-Man did for video games, where it popularized
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.860]   them in a way that was just insane at the time.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.020]   Had a song, had a cartoon, had all of the things.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.020]   Nintendo comes along.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.420]   So it was always part of...
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.900]   You know, I think if you were a kid growing up then, it was such a newness to playing
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.100]   things like that.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.620]   I remember being in fifth grade when the TRS-80 was brought into the classroom and there was
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.980]   a Star Trek game.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.820]   And I was enamored with it and they were going to start teaching some rudimentary programming.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.900]   Like, "Okay, would you like to know how this is made?"
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.900]   And I was hooked.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.980]   I was like, "I need to figure out how to make this stuff."
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:34.820]   And so I was a self-taught programmer and my whole goal was to write my own video games.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:42.140]   And by sixth, seventh grade, I had written my own much better Star Trek clone for the
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.980]   Apple II.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.060]   And I really enjoyed programming on the Apple II then.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:56.420]   And that, I think, was the right level of complexity at that age where you were always
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.340]   learning but you could still understand a lot of the problem set for like, "This is
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.860]   what I want to get on the screen."
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.140]   And I was also into art.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.380]   So I did a lot of art and I did a lot of programming and I was always making games.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.300]   That was my hobby from the time I was 10 or 12.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.340]   What was to you involved in making games?
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.340]   How did you think of it?
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.660]   Was it from a graphics perspective, like what shows up on screen?
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.180]   Was it how it makes you feel?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.380]   Was it about the story?
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:31.020]   Was it the text-based stuff and the dialogue and the prompting?
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.340]   What does it mean to create a video game at that young age to you?
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:40.900]   Well, it was a way of experiencing things that I couldn't myself.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:49.220]   So if you're playing Dungeons and Dragons at the time too, where you really feel, even
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:55.420]   pen and paper, these are like, they feel somewhat in quotes "real" to you as you're playing
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   them.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.340]   You're very invested in your character and what you're doing.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.900]   And then I love the games, the Wizardry and Ultima, that were able to bring that to a
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.740]   computer so I could do it on my own time.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.260]   It was very, very real to me.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.820]   I'd sit in my bedroom and then go to bed and think about it.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.220]   And then, "Oh no, I have to go to school.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.500]   I want to come home and figure out how to do this problem in the game."
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:22.100]   And so whatever I was creating was something that I was excited about at the time.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.780]   I made Raiders of the Lost Ark games.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.100]   Like with graphics and everything?
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.100]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.820]   So it was usually, you know, I made a Miami Vice game, made a Gru the Wanderer game, made
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.980]   a Traveler game.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:39.700]   But every time I was doing it, I wanted to figure out a new method on the Apple II of
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.740]   pulling it off graphically.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:47.400]   Whether that was editing character sets to get graphics in different formats, or how
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.900]   can I enable the secret double high res mode it had, or just things like that where it
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.940]   became kind of this limitless, "What can I make this do?"
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.700]   And I had some friends who were doing the same thing.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.900]   And then you get into who can impress each other.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.140]   And I was kind of middle of the pack, I would say.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.740]   But again, this was the time where they're bringing computers into the school, and the
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.660]   Apples come into the school, and the teachers are learning it because they have to teach
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.660]   the students.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:23.980]   But then I would say I was part of a group of students that were like way past that.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:29.380]   And it was very much of a self-taught, you know, "How do you make this thing dance?"
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.200]   I'd like to ask a strange question.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:39.860]   So at that time, a lot of people consider you one of, if not the greatest game designer/creator
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.660]   of all time.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.900]   You were middle of the pack then.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:51.800]   Did you ever sense that this would be your life, and you would also be creating the greatest
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.340]   games ever?
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   Not in the slightest.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.340]   No, I don't think anybody...
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.880]   But I was very much like that was my dream at that age.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.680]   But you don't think that that's a job.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:15.060]   You know, and as I got older, I was really going through college, and even the computer
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:22.180]   classes then weren't where I wanted them to be, so I was still kind of doing my own stuff.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.740]   And I ended up getting a business degree and then interviewing for some jobs, like finance
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   jobs.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.420]   So, well, I guess I should do this to make money, and I can keep doing this on the side.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.800]   And I remember I actually got to like the final level of like this corporate finance
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.280]   job at Circuit City.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.160]   And they turned me down.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.600]   And I was like, "Fuck them.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.320]   I'm just gonna go make video games."
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.120]   So thank you, Circuit City.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.280]   Yeah, I remember Circuit City.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.560]   I think they went bankrupt, actually.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.880]   Well, they were based in Richmond.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   I was going to school close to there, and so...
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:02.600]   So what's the origin story of you joining Bethesda Softworks at the time?
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:11.000]   So I had gotten Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 for Christmas from my girlfriend at the time,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.800]   who's now my wife.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:23.880]   I was in college, and I noticed that it was in Rockville, Maryland.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.080]   And oh, that's on my way home over Christmas break, back to William & Mary, where I went
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.600]   to college.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.660]   And I was at this point committed, like, "This is what I want to do.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.520]   So I'm just going to drive by and knock on the door," which is what I did.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:44.040]   So I drove by and knocked on the doors, Martin Luther King Day '93.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.720]   And someone came out and met me and said, "Well, maybe..."
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   And I said, "Well, I'm in college.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.040]   I'm talking about when I'm out of school."
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.840]   I'm like, "Okay, well, contact us then."
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.160]   And I will say I would contact them every once in a while.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:07.360]   I did work for a small software company right out of school, down in that area of Williamsburg,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   and still would contact Bethesda.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.160]   Arena had just come out.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.520]   So then we're in '94.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.160]   Arena had just come out, and I loved it.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   So I was into sports games.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.560]   I like the hockey stuff.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   They were doing a basketball...
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   They did a basketball game.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.960]   Yeah, I'm just looking at...
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   They did a lot of...
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   They did, like, six sports games, six.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.040]   Bethesda, at least ten games.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.560]   Six of them sports games, NCAA basketball, hockey league simulator.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.680]   Hockey league simulator, yeah.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.120]   So it was really like sports gridiron, which is like the first kind of physics-based football
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.440]   game at the time.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.760]   And there's a famous story with Electronic Arts trying to do Madden and then hiring Bethesda
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.840]   before my time to make Madden, 'cause they were struggling.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:56.280]   When I started at Bethesda, I remember the owner had John Madden's Oakland Raiders playbook
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.280]   in his office.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.120]   Like, "Ooh, can I see that?"
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   And I love sports, right?
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.600]   So I still play Madden to this day.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   I love it.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   So there's an alternate reality where...
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   I made sports games?
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   This blew my mind.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.360]   I wanted to make, like, the ultimate college football game.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   Well, it's always like...
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   You know, it's like music.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.760]   You probably listen to lots of type of music.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   Like, you don't play every time.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.640]   But I think of open worlds as fundamentally different.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.840]   Absolutely sure.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:28.760]   No, like, source of happiness, entertainments, storytelling, world, gaming than Madden.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   I mean, it's just...
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.160]   'Cause I love both.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.760]   I love both worlds, but...
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.480]   They're two totally different experiences.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.960]   Just like when you might watch a movie, you might be in the mood for Lord of the Rings
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.400]   one day, and then you want some other, I don't know, competitive show or game show or something
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   like that.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   Or watch football on TV, right?
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   You watch football on TV.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.060]   But then you kind of want to watch, get really into Game of Thrones.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.560]   So I think all those things have validity.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.400]   And actually, one of the first things I worked on when I started at Bethesda was NCAA basketball,
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.140]   Road to the Final Four 2.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.000]   So that was kind of an external project.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.740]   It came in like, "Hey, you know sports.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.440]   Get this game done."
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   And then went on to...
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   But they were doing everything I loved.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.720]   It was like, "This is where I have to work."
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.840]   They're doing, like, the Terminator science fiction stuff.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   I love that.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.320]   They're doing these open world role playing games.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   I love that.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   And they're doing sports.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.000]   Like, "This, I have to work here."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   So I started there.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.840]   And Arena, you loved.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   I loved it.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.000]   So when I came in, it had just come out, and they were doing the CD-ROM version.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.200]   So CD-ROMs aren't even out yet.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.440]   Oh, it used to be floppy disks.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   That's probably when...
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   What was Arena released?
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.680]   We would burn them in the basement.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.880]   We had the disk replicators.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.240]   Right.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.960]   So Arena was not released on floppy.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   It was.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.440]   Yeah, I believe it's six floppy disks.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   Six floppy disks.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.080]   Maybe it was eight.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.200]   But in those days, the number of floppy disks was very, very important to what the money
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.960]   you were making.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.760]   So if you wanted to do a big, huge game, like, "Well, that's just too many disks."
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:15.440]   So the CD-ROM became this jumping off point for the whole industry where, "Oh, it's unlimited
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   data."
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:23.400]   By the way, I played Arena.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.720]   So that was, of course, attained legally, as one does.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   Alternate means?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   By alternate means.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   Right.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   On floppy disks.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.520]   And that was such an incredible...
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.280]   As you probably have seen, interacting with a large number of people.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.920]   It's a whole world.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.080]   It's a world that you escape to in the way...
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   Your favorite book, like Lord of the Rings.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.520]   It was just...
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.760]   It was unlike anything else.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   It was incredible.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760]   It's probably...
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.220]   I mean, of course, as people say, the first game you play is the one that really sentimentally
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.920]   means the most to you.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:10.080]   I think the first role-playing game I played, and it just changed everything.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   Was Arena?
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.280]   It was Arena, yeah.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:19.880]   I think Daggerfall is what I really played, especially because, like you said, the character
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   development was really rich.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.320]   But just that you can feel like you travel to this whole other world that's less about
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.200]   entertainment like a shooting game and more about a world.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   It felt like it's a world.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.600]   Like you're literally there.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   You can travel there.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   You can live there.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:47.120]   You actually feel like that person versus like a Pac-Man, like an arcade, fun, entertaining
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.960]   adventure game.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.540]   So you joined...
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.820]   You made it.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.040]   What did you work on first there?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   I worked...
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.440]   Well, everyone did a bunch of stuff.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.520]   So I worked on the basketball game really just to get it out the door.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.840]   And Terminator Future Shock.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.680]   So we were doing Future Shock and Daggerfall at the same time.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.180]   They were developing a new engine.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.520]   So it was one of the first 3D engines, the X-Engine.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.800]   There were a bunch of guys from Denmark, actually.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.160]   There's like a big Danish demo scene in those days on the PC.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.440]   And so a bunch of the top programmers there...
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   Well, look, this is not big.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.480]   This is not a big company.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.280]   There's 20 people in development.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.320]   And we were doing both Daggerfall and the new Terminator.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.080]   And so Daggerfall was a bit more, again, behind the Terminator game.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.200]   So I was one of the main people on the Terminator team.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   And I don't know.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   Things kind of worked out.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   I very quickly...
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   I don't know why.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   Like I quickly became the producer and I was making levels and doing all these things.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.680]   And it was awesome.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   And looking back now, I can understand it better.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.240]   But at the time, I didn't appreciate it, which is no one quite owned the Terminator license.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.680]   It was in this limbo, legally.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.720]   So there was no one to tell us, "No, you can't do that."
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.440]   So we would pick apart the movies and, "Oh, how does he mention the gun he wants and the
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.080]   wattage of the laser and all these things?"
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   And so Future Shock is a game that I still love today.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:30.320]   It does a lot of things that if you go back and look at it, we're frankly still doing.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   It's a large, open world, post-apocalyptic landscape height map with instanced objects
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   all over it.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   And that is still a lot of how we build our worlds.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.060]   What's an instanced object?
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:57.600]   Some games, every wall or building is unique in its data, whereas we would just build these
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.460]   little husks of buildings and then place them all over the place.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.600]   So the memory and the way you render it is much more optimal.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.960]   So that allows you to build a bigger world, a more open world?
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.900]   It allows you to build a bigger world much faster.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.300]   Not every single version of that building is in its own unique architecture that is
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.740]   going to take up memory and processing speed, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.920]   So you're there very much feeling the computational constraints of the system when you're creating
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   these open worlds?
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   And you know what?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   That's the thing then.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:34.180]   You see some of it now, but in those times, I do feel like every year the technology moved.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.300]   And maybe it's because, same thing, we're like that my age at that time, where every
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:45.340]   year somebody was coming up with some new method or some new game system.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:53.700]   And it was every year that innovation, innovation, innovation, and then 3D acceleration comes
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.940]   along and then these things come along and then HD comes along.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:03.420]   And it is true that as time goes on, there is visually a diminishing return in terms
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.740]   of what you're able to do on the screen.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.620]   And there's a ton of work that goes into it now because just rendering this cup to
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.780]   the perfect shine and material and roughness and how does the global illumination off this
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.060]   wall, it's a ton of work.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   But you can pretty much do what you want now if you want to put the time in.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.740]   Whereas then, okay, you can't do everything you want.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:34.060]   So pick your battles really carefully and technically you can do what you want, if that
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060]   makes sense.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:45.020]   - How much trade-off is there now in how much effort you put into the realism of the graphics
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.900]   versus the story?
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:52.780]   And actually not even how much effort you put in, but is there a trade-off in the experience,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:58.300]   the feel of the game in terms of realism and story?
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.580]   - Usually we will start with let the player have as much agency and do as many things
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.380]   as they can as possible.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:11.220]   And we will sacrifice some graphic fidelity for that, some speed for that.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.760]   We could make a game that, traditionally our games are, we're okay with 30 frames a second
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.820]   as long as it looks really good and the simulation's running and all of those things.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.740]   So we'll sacrifice some of that fidelity for the player experience and the kind of
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.460]   things that I do.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:34.300]   But from a manpower standpoint, the graphics programmers work on graphics, the artists
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:40.100]   work on art, and we have an awesome team of artists and designers and writers and programmers.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:47.180]   It's usually where we find as time goes on, the amount of art time that it takes to create
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.700]   a cup compared to what it used to be, that has increased.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.820]   So we do use, most people use art outsourcing as well so that we're not, we still relatively
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.060]   compared to our industry and what we're doing, have smaller teams.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.860]   - What about the experience of the beauty of the graphics?
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:14.780]   So like one of the most amazing things about Skyrim, and maybe you could say that about
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.260]   some of the other games, but for me Skyrim is the outdoor, when you step outside, it's
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.860]   the outdoor scenery.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:28.620]   So what does it take to create the feeling, especially of that, being outdoors of nature
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.620]   and just like lost in the beauty, whatever it is when you go hiking and you feel the
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.940]   awe of it, how do you create that awe?
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.940]   Is that graphics?
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.100]   What is that?
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.420]   - It's a lot of graphics.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.420]   It's a lot of mood.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.860]   Let me just talk about it in terms of tone.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:51.700]   And those are, again, going back to my previous comment, the graphics are very, very important
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:57.540]   to us because, and we always push them, because when you're doing the kind of things we do
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:02.940]   where you step into a virtual world, it does have to have that moment of wow, this feels
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   real.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.780]   I've never experienced this.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:17.220]   And it's okay, I think it's okay to let just like the time settle, meaning you step out,
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.300]   how does the wind sound?
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   How are the trees moving?
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.380]   How are the clouds moving?
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.060]   I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.300]   How does it land over the water?
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.420]   Like it doesn't have to be like, hey, let's go, let's finish a quest, let's go kill things,
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.780]   let's figure out the next step, let's level up.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.900]   I like the quiet moments a lot.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.060]   And I think when you play our games, you can tell we spend a lot of time on them.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.780]   Then you watch the weather roll in.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:54.060]   I think that's just part of being, being that character, being that person in that space.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.740]   - Yeah, I saw that there's a mod that removes all enemies.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.620]   I've been meaning to do that, to just do like a live stream where I for hours walk around
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.060]   Skyrim just, and then answer questions and so on.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:13.740]   That just feels, that's a completely stress-free environment.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.380]   It's just, you are just like you said, in this moment in time.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.300]   It's so incredible.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.540]   It feels as incredible as going hiking or something like that.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:30.060]   But in another, in a totally different place, like Iceland or something like that, this
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.940]   whole other surreal, ethereal place.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.500]   So yeah, it's incredible how you kind of create that.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   So graphics is a part of that, but also letting it, the temporal aspect of that, like the
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.900]   wind, the rustling sound and look and all of that.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.460]   - The soundscape is really, really important.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.340]   And the sky, we spend a lot of time on the sky, because it's taking up much more of the
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.980]   screen than a lot of people give credit for.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.020]   - What about the rendering, the openness of it?
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.020]   Like how do you, is that?
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.540]   - There's a lot of level of detail, streaming work.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.060]   And nowadays it's getting more common.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.780]   Like frankly, the systems are built better for it.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.340]   Hard drive speed is really prioritized.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.380]   Like they're so blazing fast.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:23.220]   You take Skyrim and Oblivion and the fallouts of that 360 era.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:30.420]   It's a, and it was a lot of time spent on how do we get all this data streaming in as
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:38.940]   you move, and then levels of detail so you can see all the way, but not crush the processor.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.460]   - You know what, let's even step back, 'cause you mentioned tone.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.100]   You mentioned tone a lot.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.620]   What do you mean by tone?
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.220]   - It's all of it together.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:52.500]   If you look at, I think you can flip through, let's just take fantasy.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.260]   You can sort of look at a couple images or things and know how does Lord of the Rings
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:11.220]   different from Game of Thrones that is different than a Thurian like Excalibur, or your sci-fi
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:21.060]   channel series of the month kind of thing.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:27.180]   And so finding that, what's gonna make it kind of unique, and usually I lean on something
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:39.740]   that is grounded in reality for what it is, and then have lesser kind of fantastical things,
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.580]   at least at the start, and then they kind of build.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.500]   So even when we do Starfield, I mean it's a science fiction game, there are laser guns
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.560]   and spaceships that fire around and shoot each other and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:57.060]   but it's grounded in, you can look at it and say, "Okay, this is kind of an extension of
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.940]   things as we view them today in space."
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:08.120]   And we sort of take the same approach with Fallout, where admittedly things can get even
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:14.300]   a little bit crazier the longer you're developing Fallout content.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:23.180]   So just to linger on this, so defining the tone starts at creating a realistic experience,
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.020]   like you feel like, "I could walk into this and this feels like life."
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.780]   What's their technology level, even for a fantasy world?
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.420]   Like is magic, how prevalent is it?
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.980]   Or are they making weapons and things and armor?
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.820]   Is it for utility?
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.700]   Is it for decoration?
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.420]   How do they live their lives?
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:48.260]   Does this feel like a place that you believe that has some grounding in our reality, whether
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:55.860]   that's historical or near future, or that it's grounded in some semblance of the reality
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.500]   that you and I understand so that it can feel, it's also making it feel a little bit welcoming.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.100]   Like, "Okay, I understand this."
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.540]   Is that art or science?
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:10.700]   So how do you know when it feels welcoming and everything fits and is grounded?
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.700]   I don't know.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.220]   I guess it's personal taste.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.820]   Some people like things that are weirder, that have more fantastical from the get-go.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.900]   Even a game like Morrowind, where we get into some more fantastical things, it intentionally
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.580]   starts a little more grounded.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:33.020]   There's a very classic medieval-looking town that you come into, but you look just beyond
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.980]   it and there are mushroom trees and giant insects and things like that.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:44.020]   So in Skyrim, when you put a dragon in it, what are your thoughts about dragons and tone?
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.420]   How does that fit into tone?
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.700]   That's a great question.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.900]   It's a ridiculous question, but yeah, I just love dragons, so I wanted to bring it up.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   No, no, no.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.140]   These are the things that we debate with...
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.100]   Do we include a dragon?
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.940]   Why didn't you include a dragon in Daggerfall?
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   That's what I want to know.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   I think there's dragonlings.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.940]   They're hard to do.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.940]   Dragons are hard to do.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.340]   So when you start Skyrim, say, "Hey, look, dragons are going to be a theme."
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.260]   Start visually.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.060]   You can make the argument that dragons existed.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.380]   Okay, what would they look like?
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.900]   How close to dinosaurs would they be?
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.900]   And ours are less...
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.460]   I believe they're less fantastical-looking in general.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.060]   They look like beasts that could exist in that world.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.860]   And then how we introduce them, it's kind of a little bit of a slow roll in Skyrim,
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.460]   and that the people in the world are reacting to the dragons appearing.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.880]   And that's somewhat mirrors...
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.500]   You want something that mirrors the player experience as well.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.660]   It says back to you, like, "Hey, no, these are...
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.660]   This is...
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.660]   Have you heard this?
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.660]   Someone saw a dragon."
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.660]   That's what Daggerfall...
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.780]   Isn't there mentions of dragons or something?
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:02.100]   Because I remember being sure that there's dragons in Daggerfall as I'm playing it and
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.100]   I'm searching.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   You're pretty sure...
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   Well...
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.100]   Is there a dragon in Daggerfall?
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.500]   There's dragon wings in Daggerfall.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.500]   To my memory...
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   Look, I guess someone will probably correct me.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.940]   Like, "Actually, there is a dragon here."
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.140]   But I'm pretty sure they're not.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.340]   And then a game I did, Redguard, which we bring back a dragon...
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:25.060]   It takes place beforehand, so we have a dragon there in that game, and that was unique to
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.540]   that at the time.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.300]   Just a brief tangent on that.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.020]   I thought Redguard was a really, really good game.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.380]   I played it and there's a...
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.780]   Again, you don't...
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.180]   You forget stuff, but I remember getting...
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.500]   I guess it was the first in the Elder Scrolls series to put it into that world, but it was
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.820]   like an adventure game.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.940]   It reminded me of another game I really love, like Prince of Persia.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.940]   That was one of the inspirations.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.940]   Prince of Persia is one of my favorite games.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.700]   I apologize if I'm forgetting, but you can jump in buildings and stuff.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.100]   There's a dynamic, airy nature.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   It's a park-more type of situation.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.420]   Yeah, it was an incredible game.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.420]   Why do you think...
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.420]   Let me ask a dark question.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.340]   Why do you think that game was a flop?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.340]   One of the few...
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.340]   Not a dark question.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.340]   It was.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.420]   Well, a lot of reasons.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.300]   One that I love and really got us going on a handcrafted world.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   We're coming off of Daggerfall.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.140]   Morrowind is sort of in design.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.500]   Then part of our development teams broke up to do different things.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.820]   The game that did Battlespire and Redguard was my game.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.100]   I wanted to do something a little more Ultima feeling, handcrafted world.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.820]   I really like things that blend up genres.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:52.300]   I know it's in the adventure game category, but it really does a lot of things.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.140]   It's a love letter to Prince of Persia.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.060]   There's a little Raiders of the Lost Ark in it.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.980]   There's a lot of Ultima in it.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.380]   Really see what we could do with the engine.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.540]   It's very much, I think, plays...
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.100]   It would have had a much better home on, say, PlayStation or Xbox.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.820]   This predates Xbox.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.660]   It's much more constantly Tomb Raider had come out.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:20.300]   You see those influences of Tomb Raider on that game.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.540]   3D effects cards had just come out.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.940]   Okay, we can do...
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.460]   It was the last.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.940]   I think it's one of the last DOS games in a Windows world.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.180]   I think it missed a technology window,
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:38.620]   as well as, ultimately, not what people wanted from us.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.500]   I felt I was really kind of...
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.260]   The company let me make that game, and it was a big flop.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.700]   Battlespire hadn't done well.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   The company was in really bad shape,
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.020]   and I felt really personally responsible.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.140]   They let me do this creative thing.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.180]   It didn't do what we needed it to do,
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:05.220]   and now we're in a very, very bad situation.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.620]   Company almost went out of business.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:12.660]   And that's when it got reformed with ZeniMax Media,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.300]   and Robert Altman came in, and we were starting Morrowind.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.460]   We had just sort of started,
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.180]   and it was sort of that whole experience
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.300]   that made you sort of realize...
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.620]   Someone says to you, "Okay, you're gonna get another shot."
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.620]   And that's where you're like, "Okay, we're gonna make Morrowind
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.300]   and make the biggest, best RPG we can make.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.820]   We know what the audience wants from us.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.900]   We know what we could do building a world."
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.180]   So there's callbacks to how we built the world in Redguard.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.740]   Morrowind is a large-scale, handcrafted...
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.780]   But if you were to put it pixel per pixel with Daggerfall,
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.180]   you wouldn't even see Morrowind,
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.180]   because Daggerfall is so big.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.820]   But the impact of playing it, I think,
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.020]   is in many ways equal, but different.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.460]   - Just you personally, psychologically,
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.300]   did you have doubt about yourself
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.100]   from the performance of Redguard?
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.740]   Do I even know what it is?
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.500]   - Of course, of course.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.380]   - Where do you get the...
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.620]   How'd you overcome that?
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.500]   - I don't know.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.740]   I would say this, honestly, I enjoy it so much.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:19.020]   I'm so heads down, that becomes, for better or worse,
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.980]   like my life.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.820]   - Yeah.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.420]   - And it's just something that I wanna play so much,
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.980]   it becomes like there's a little bit...
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.940]   You get a little obsessed with it.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.180]   - No, but I mean, you love Redguard, right?
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.740]   So doesn't that mean...
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.660]   Isn't there a kind of self-doubt about,
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.060]   do I know what it takes to create a great game?
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.940]   - Well, no, I think Redguard's a great game.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.420]   - Right, so you were sure, even if it wasn't...
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.340]   - Okay, so if you're in a debate, like, do I like that game?
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.660]   It's about finding an...
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.780]   Okay, so I love Redguard.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.460]   And the people who play it, it won a bunch of awards.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.580]   Critically, it was a pretty good game.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.860]   Did not sell.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.180]   And the reason for that, again,
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.420]   we probably made the wrong type of game,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.260]   and we missed a technology window.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.780]   We also thought it was very conservative.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.260]   We're gonna do this.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.980]   So my main takeaway was,
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.220]   I'm not gonna be conservative again.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.860]   I'm gonna swing for the fences.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.660]   And we've had...
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.900]   There'll be some rough edges in swinging for the fences
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.180]   and shooting for the moon,
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.860]   but we'd rather do that and land where we land
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.660]   than be very, very conservative
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.140]   in what we're putting out there.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.340]   - You've mentioned, just referencing this game,
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.340]   on the Reddit AMA,
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.260]   that long time ago during Redguard,
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.540]   the lead programmer made me,
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.860]   made all the buildings hop up and down
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.180]   after you played for 10 minutes just to mess with me.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.900]   Just an curious tangent.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.020]   What's involved with programming in open-world game?
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.020]   So we talked about, we will talk about design and so on,
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.340]   but specifically the programming.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.420]   'Cause I think this question came from,
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.780]   what are some interesting sticky bugs
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.060]   that you've encountered throughout your life
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.260]   in creating these games?
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.220]   And this is one of them that you mentioned.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.420]   So what are some of the challenges
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.180]   of programming these open-world games?
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.500]   - I mean, there are different flavors of them, right?
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.260]   Your GTAs will have different issues
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.140]   than the Ubisoft games versus our games.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.740]   I can sort of speak to ours,
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.780]   which is you wanna build systems, right?
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.460]   'Cause they're gonna play the game for a very long time
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.420]   as well, which we've learned.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.420]   And you can't go through and touch everything by hand,
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.900]   per se.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.620]   So you have to rely on some systemic level of creation
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.060]   and a lot of systems that are robust enough
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.740]   so that when they touch another one,
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.700]   things aren't breaking apart.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.860]   - So there's like a, what are the major systems?
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.540]   Is there like the physics of the game,
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.060]   the engine of how like stuff,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.740]   yeah, like, yeah, the physics, the motion,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.900]   and maybe how light is rendered and all that kind of stuff.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.980]   - Right, so you have the rendering, right?
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.860]   Of like, okay, this is how I'm gonna render
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.460]   the data that I have.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.220]   So a lot of people confuse engines with rendering.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.900]   I mean, they're combined, obviously,
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.620]   but there's the data you're gonna give to a renderer,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.420]   which is the thing, you know,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.060]   that draws the pixels on the screen.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.140]   So there's a, most of the engine is,
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.020]   how are you gonna bring in that data
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.500]   and give it to the renderer to draw it?
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.820]   So you have that whole system of walking through the world,
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.580]   feeding in the data and drawing it.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   You then obviously have the physics and the interactivity.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.660]   What are the things that are there just to be drawn?
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.780]   And what are the things there
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.740]   that are meant to be interacted with and touched?
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.540]   We put a big premium on the ones
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.620]   that can be interacted with and touched,
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.180]   whether it's flowers, whether the trees move,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.780]   whether you can sleep on the sofa, sit in this chair,
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.580]   pick up all this stuff, bake bread, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.980]   You then have the AI, which loops in the stuff
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.260]   we talked about earlier in terms of processing everybody,
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.140]   and combat systems, which is a lot of what,
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.460]   and the people end up doing,
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.380]   combat systems on top of that AI.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.220]   How do they react to those types of things?
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   And then how do they look at the things
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.420]   that can be interacted with?
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.540]   One of my favorite things is when NPCs
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.100]   will go pick up weapons in the world,
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.220]   which you don't see in other games.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.500]   And the first time you see it in one of ours,
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.140]   it's very unexpected.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.940]   You can drop a crazy weapon, be in a fight,
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.380]   and an NPC runs over, picks it up, and uses it on you.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:42.420]   It's not something you would expect, but I love that stuff.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.860]   - And that's integrated into a larger system,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.340]   the ability to pick up, the NPC picking up,
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.540]   so it's not like a little quirk that's hard-coded in.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.180]   It's part of a bigger system.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.820]   - They have their own AI for scanning the environment,
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.660]   and that's one of the rules.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.460]   Hey, is there a weapon that is better than the one I have?
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.720]   I'm gonna go get it.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.420]   Now, we do lock off if it's in a chest,
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.300]   and that's treasure we left for the player.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.780]   But it's in particular, 'cause what you don't want,
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.620]   we actually had this problem, started in Oblivion,
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.060]   I believe, which is we set up a level.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.500]   Hey, let the enemies go pick up the weapons
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.440]   if they're better.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.700]   So we make a level and go in,
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.180]   and all of the enemies are armed to the teeth,
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.540]   and there's no treasure for the player,
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.060]   because the enemies went and took all the good weapons.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.820]   And you say, okay, they don't take those.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.660]   They take the ones that are dropped
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.660]   by other NPCs or the player.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.500]   - That's such a fascinating world
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.900]   of designing the experience for the NPC,
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.380]   because in part, that experience
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.380]   defines the experience of the player.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.540]   So how they interact with their environment
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.240]   defines how the player experiences their environment.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.440]   Is there room for further and further development
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.940]   of the AI that controls the NPC?
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.240]   - Sure, we're always iterating on it.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.040]   And again, as we look in the future,
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.120]   it's more about us finding those,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.960]   more reactivity to the player,
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.460]   and also understanding their roles in the world.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.640]   So they're not just there.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.740]   They're not just there for the player
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.840]   as a signpost for the player.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.240]   - But they're reacting to the player.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.700]   But what about some of the richest experiences we have
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.880]   with people is like the chaos of it,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.760]   the push and pull, the unpredictability.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.940]   Is there something, I don't know if you've been following,
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:37.780]   but the quick, amazing development of language models,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.660]   the neural network, natural language processing systems,
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.160]   dialogue systems.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.200]   Do you think there's some possibility of using
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.780]   sort of these incredible neural nets
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.580]   that can have open-ended dialogue, basically chatbots?
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.960]   - Yep, I've seen some incredible demos.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.660]   I do think it's coming.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.700]   I don't know when.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.860]   And there's a little bit of a question,
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   like what's ready for real deployment and release
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   versus, hey, let's use that to generate some things
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.040]   that is then static that we're giving to the players,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.720]   versus it's generated on the fly.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.400]   But it's definitely coming.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.320]   It's definitely coming.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.600]   And I think you'll see it in the types of games that we do.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.680]   It has great application.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.000]   - I love the idea that you'll be using that
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.720]   to design different NPCs and then testing
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   if they're good enough.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.000]   If they're a little too crazy,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.600]   you don't want the super--
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.680]   - Right, but if we go back to it being reactive,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.520]   some of that bot stuff, it's incredible.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.800]   It's then translating that into voice.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.400]   And then is that being done by the client?
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   Is it being done on a server?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.160]   Is it baked into the game?
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.240]   There's different flavors of it.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.440]   - So there's still computational challenges,
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.720]   like how do you actually make that happen?
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.700]   - Right.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.840]   - Well, what about in terms of creating
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.500]   the feeling of an NPC,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.800]   what's the role of voice actors?
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.160]   - Awesome, yeah.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.120]   We work with a ton of voice actors
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.240]   and they bring so much to it.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.540]   And that's the thing.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:26.240]   We can write some stuff and the best ones get in there
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.160]   and make it so much better, or even ad lib things.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.920]   And so we do a lot of voice recording.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.720]   And we used to do it kind of like at the end of the project.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.560]   And now we do it throughout.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.500]   We start really early and we just start recording.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.220]   So we're recording for years and years, literally.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.240]   Probably three years, four years.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.060]   - So part of the actual experience of the recording
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.920]   will help define the characters and the tone of the game.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.120]   - Right, and we'll go back sometimes
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.200]   and, "Hey, we really like this.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.240]   "We want more of this.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.040]   "Let's write, let's do another session."
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.700]   Or, "Hey, we don't think this character's actually working.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.720]   "We want you to do a different,
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.800]   "you're gonna be someone else now.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.640]   "Sorry, that got cut."
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.480]   - Do you ever try to sort of imagine
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.160]   that people fall in love with the characters,
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.040]   with the NPCs?
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.880]   - I do.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.800]   - Like, do they get really attached to the--
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.760]   - Oh yeah, I mean, I've done it in games.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.600]   - These are like close friends, right?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.320]   Like, you can, like you miss them.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.160]   - 100%. - Isn't that part
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:24.980]   of the thing you miss? - I actually,
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.920]   like whenever I'm playing a game and there is, you know,
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.800]   if there's like a friendship option
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.320]   or make friends or a romance thing,
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.420]   I find those moments really, I enjoy them.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.980]   I find them pretty impactful emotionally
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.820]   to what we're doing.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.300]   And so we've done a little bit of it.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.260]   It's one of the things that we actually have pushed
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.020]   in Starfield.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.500]   So we have a number of companions, but for them,
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.100]   we go, you know, I won't say super complex romantic,
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.460]   but more complex relationships than we've had
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   in terms of not just some, you know, state of they like you
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.880]   or they don't like you, but they can be in love with you
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.800]   and dislike something you did and be pissed
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.480]   at you temporarily and then come back to loving you.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.940]   - So that relationship status, if it's complicated,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.040]   that they're existing in that gray area, it's complicated.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.640]   We're not dating, we're just, we're--
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.360]   - Well, it's in a lot of games, you know, previous stuff,
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.160]   you just work your way up, they like you more and more
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.560]   and more and more, and now you're in a relationship.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.400]   - Now you're in, yeah.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.920]   - And when you make them upset, you drift out of,
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.240]   like it never happened, you know, you drift out of it.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.400]   Whereas we wanted one where, okay,
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.320]   we can be in a relationship and we've committed
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.680]   to each other in some way, but I just did something
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.800]   that really made you angry.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.760]   And as opposed to just drifting out of that status,
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.400]   you're in a temporary, I don't like what you did state.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.720]   - Wow, so some greater degree of complexity
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.200]   in the relationship with a companion.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.040]   - A little bit.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.480]   - A little bit, a little bit.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.320]   Are we talking about--
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.040]   - I don't wanna oversell that part, but my point is,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.240]   I think those things where you meet a character in a game
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.360]   and you do spend time with them, a companion in a game,
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.640]   and it leads to romance, you know, myself and others,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.560]   and I find a lot of players,
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.680]   those moments are really, really impactful,
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.680]   and special to them 'cause they did put in the time.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.080]   That's another thing that I always commit it with,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.820]   which is, I think people who don't play video games,
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.800]   they sometimes think like, oh, that's, I don't know,
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.040]   that's a waste of time, or that's not real,
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.760]   or that's not like, you're not getting a lot out of that.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.720]   Like, well, you haven't really experienced it
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.240]   in the way that you can,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.560]   because these moments that I spent in games,
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.280]   not the ones I made, other ones when I was growing up,
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.420]   or even now, that is important time to me.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.260]   Like, I love those moments.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:45.000]   I felt really, like, proud of what I accomplished.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.120]   And we want people to have that in our games,
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.800]   and the fact that they have had those experiences,
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.320]   and we hear from them, and how important it is to them,
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.240]   it's like, no, this is really, really special.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.280]   - Yeah, it's fun.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.520]   I mean, from a game design perspective,
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.720]   I wonder if you can honor the time you spent
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:10.200]   together with a game, because, you know,
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.040]   sometimes there's a heartbreak at the end of the game.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   Like, when you're, when you leave a game, there's a,
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.200]   yeah, it's a really complicated relationship, actually,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.840]   because when you leave a game,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.480]   it's almost like leaving a romantic partner,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.160]   because it's like you spent so much meaningful time
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.160]   together, and there's a sense in which it was,
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.920]   it was ephemeral.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.520]   Like, this is not, this doesn't--
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.360]   - It didn't happen.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.480]   - Yeah, it didn't really happen.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.440]   It was good, it was like you went to Vegas,
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.120]   you got drunk and stuff, and now life goes on.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.560]   I wonder if there's a way to sort of
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.440]   always carry that with you.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.920]   I mean, I guess with words, you can kinda
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.080]   share with others, like--
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.320]   - It's weird, I don't, like, now that we're in the age
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.880]   where you have achievements, and you can look
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.720]   at your library and see your hours in games,
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.320]   like, that's, like, it's almost like a scrapbook now.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.080]   Like, I wish, one of my wishes was, like,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.040]   I wish I had that achievement list for everything,
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.640]   like, back to the late '70s.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.720]   - Like, every game you played--
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.000]   - Right, when, yeah.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.040]   - Yeah, like, you, I mean, that's one of the cool things
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.240]   with Xbox, like, we're moving towards that direction.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.880]   It'd be cool to be, from, like, childhood,
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.400]   the first time you play a video game,
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.880]   it will actually tell you what is the first game you played.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.840]   - But you know what?
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.560]   Kids today, they will have that.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.720]   - They will have that.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.880]   And see--
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.640]   - But you could look back and see, oh my God,
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.080]   I put 1,000 hours in Daggerfall.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.920]   - What is the first game--
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.360]   - And my last save was 1997.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.200]   - Last save.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.480]   Man, I don't know, Golden Axe, maybe?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.920]   I'm trying to think, what was the first game I ever played?
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.160]   No, it was probably Commodore 64 games, yeah.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.880]   Yeah, arcade games.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.720]   Okay.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.280]   You mentioned Starfield.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.440]   What is Starfield?
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.520]   And what's the origin story of this game?
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:10.760]   - We had always wanted to do something
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.600]   where you explore space, you know?
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.520]   The explore space role-playing game.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.520]   So take the kind of games that we make
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.680]   and give it a little bit of a different spin.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.880]   And the other games that I love,
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.200]   there was a pen and paper RPG I loved, Traveler.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.840]   It was one of the first games I made for the Apple II.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.080]   I never finished it, right?
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.600]   I'm just doing it on my own.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.240]   And I love this game, Starflight was one.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.120]   Star Control II was a game that I loved.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.800]   Sun Dog was a big one in the Apple II days
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.120]   that a lot of people don't know that I loved.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:50.120]   And so a lot of us in the studio felt
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.000]   it was time to do something new.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.840]   You know, we're going between Elder Scrolls and Fallout
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.720]   and going back and forth.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.600]   And I mean, we love that, but hey,
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.280]   we've always wanted to do this,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.720]   explore the galaxy science fiction game.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.480]   You know, now is the time to do that.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.400]   - And that's a brave move.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.280]   So Fallout is post-apocalyptic
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.480]   on a single planet.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.880]   You know, Elder Scrolls series is on a single planet.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.320]   So this is going out into the open world
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.040]   of many star systems, many planets.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.920]   I saw that it's thinking about a hundred star systems
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.400]   and a thousand planets available to explore.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.440]   What is that world of stars and planets like?
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.640]   - Well, you mentioned Daggerfall.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.800]   We go back to some of that.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.000]   Well, the first when we did it was
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.120]   how are we gonna render a planet,
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.560]   like pull it off for the player?
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.600]   Like, can we?
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.800]   Or do we have to sort of do it
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.960]   where you can't land on all of them,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.080]   where you're landing in a very controlled,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.960]   small world space that we, you know,
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.400]   kind of craft and you would have a very limited set of those.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.440]   You go back to tone, like,
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.800]   well, that's probably the wrong tone.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.320]   And how can we say yes?
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.120]   Like, I want to land on that ice ball.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.040]   So it started, we started the game
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.760]   right after Fallout 4, so 2016.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.040]   And the first thing we did was,
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.000]   how can we have a system to generate these planets
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.840]   and make them look, you know,
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.400]   I'll say reasonable as opposed to, you know,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.920]   fractally goop.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   - Well, what's the technical definition of goop?
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.880]   Fractally goop?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.720]   - Fractally goop.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.560]   You've probably seen a lot of like simulations,
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.480]   whether they're space things or landscape things,
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.080]   where they're using fractals
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.960]   and just the landscape does not look real.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.400]   It just is like highs and lows and it's muddy.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.240]   And so we did find a way, we came up with a way,
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.160]   had prototyped of building tiles,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.320]   like large tiles of landscape,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.280]   the way we would usually build them.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.960]   We kind of generate them offline,
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.280]   hand do some things and end up with these
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.640]   very realistic looking tiles of landscape.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   And then built a system that wraps those around a planet
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.520]   and blends them all together.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.480]   And we had pretty successful results with that.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.580]   And so we thought, yeah, we could do this.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:24.120]   And so there was a big design kind of problem to solve
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.920]   in terms of, well, what's fun about landing on a planet
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.680]   where there's potentially nothing?
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.080]   'Cause there's a lot of planets and moons,
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.680]   if you kind of, right?
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.440]   In reality that, well, there's nothing on 'em,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.560]   except resources.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   And so we spent a lot of time figuring out,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.200]   okay, let's just lean in on that can A,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.040]   be a lonely experience, as long as we tell the player,
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.980]   here's what's there, here are the resources that are there,
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.440]   go find them.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   But I equate it to that moment of we said about
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.960]   listening to the wind go and watching the sunset.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.520]   And I do think there's a certain beauty
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.480]   to landing on a strange planet,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:05.160]   being somewhat the only person there, building an outpost.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.500]   And we are modeling all of the systems
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.800]   'cause that's how we like to do things.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.880]   So you can watch whatever that gas giant or moon,
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.280]   it will rotate and go and sunrise, sunset,
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.160]   and all of those things that you would expect.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   And it's all really happening.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.440]   And most people probably won't notice
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.680]   or appreciate all of that,
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   but I think it gives them the ability to say,
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.200]   I wanna go do that and see that on that place,
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.480]   as long as we tell them,
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.160]   hey, the quest leads over here,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.320]   here's where the handcrafted content is
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.400]   that you would expect,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.060]   and then here's more of the open procedural
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.200]   planet experience.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.560]   - So you're-- - Long answer,
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.840]   I don't know if I answered your question.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   - There's no, the questions are stupid
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.760]   and the answers are brilliant, so that's how this works.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.360]   So this is the world's most immense simulator
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.260]   of the human condition of loneliness.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.560]   'Cause I can't imagine a more lonely experience.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.120]   - You mean you put it that way?
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.720]   I don't know if that was the goal, but--
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.640]   - Just on a planet alone,
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:16.160]   that must be a deep embodiment of what loneliness is like.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.360]   I mean, both on, like when you hike alone,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.560]   there's a deep loneliness to that.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.100]   It's like, it's humbling that this thing
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.840]   will last much longer than you,
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.720]   it's been here way before you.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.040]   - Is it the line from the moon landing?
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.440]   Beautiful desolation, the Buzz Aldrin, is it?
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.920]   - Beautiful desolation, is that what you said?
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.880]   - I think so. - Beautiful desolation.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.120]   Well-- - Something like that.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.600]   - But that's just words, there's a feeling to it,
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.160]   and you want that feeling to be real.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.680]   You just hear, there's some resources here.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.200]   I just feel like it'll hit people at a certain moment,
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.640]   like it does for me with Skyrim,
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.100]   like, holy shit, I'm here alone.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.640]   And whatever cruel nature that's out there,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.240]   it doesn't really care about me.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   (laughing)
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.320]   - Exactly. - That's the experience.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.480]   So you wanna create the whole planet,
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.200]   and you wanna have many of them.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.560]   - We have, we do have many,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.360]   but once you build that system,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.080]   I think the numbers become, I mean, honestly,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.600]   a little bit, we wrap it in so we can name them all
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.920]   and have a finite set, even though
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.940]   it's a very, very large number,
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.940]   but a set that we can validate and know about,
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.940]   even though it's a huge number.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.360]   But once you're building a system that can build a planet,
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.400]   I mean, a planet is sort of infinite space,
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.320]   we go back to the dagger fall analogy, right?
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.260]   If you have systems to build that much space,
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.800]   doing 100 planets or 1,000 or 10,000 or a million planets
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.720]   is not, it's just, you just press,
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.400]   you just change the number and press the button.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.040]   But you can't name them all, you can't control,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.440]   like, when you're getting in really big numbers,
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.480]   hey, what does this system way out here feel like
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.940]   if you take your ship and jump that far?
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.180]   We do level the systems, when you go to system,
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.080]   you'll see, oh, this is like a level 40 system.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.400]   And us being able to at least control that scale
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.600]   is how we kind of ended up
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.840]   with the hundred-ish systems we have.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.080]   - What are the levelings?
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.320]   What do you mean by level?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.400]   - It would be like when you look at a map in a game
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.480]   and it says, this is the area for low-level players,
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.880]   this is level one. - Oh, got it, got it.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.740]   - Yeah, yeah, so we do that on a system basis.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:31.880]   Star system.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.480]   - I read that space travel is considered dangerous
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.840]   in this game, can you explain?
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.040]   - That's more of, that goes back to a tone thing, right?
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.480]   When you actually play the game, 'cause it's a game,
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.120]   like, we don't really kill you when you fly out in space.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.680]   But it has a tone of, there's some effort involved,
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.080]   and we've dialed it back as we've been making the game,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.600]   whereas we used to run out of fuel,
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.060]   you'd jump and get stranded,
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.240]   which on paper was a great, like, it's a great moment
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   when you get stranded and you have to press this beacon,
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.840]   you don't know who's gonna come.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.680]   Turns out that's not, it just stops your game.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.740]   We found, you'd be playing the game and I ran out of fuel,
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.720]   okay, I guess I'll just wander these planets
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.520]   trying to mine for fuel so I can get back
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.160]   to what I was doing.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.400]   It just, it's a fun killer.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.600]   - That's too realistic of a simulation
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.760]   of the human condition.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.080]   - Yeah, no, the idea was, well, games do that.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.900]   If you had a hardcore, you're right,
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.500]   a hardcore survival mode,
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.740]   that's the kind of thing you would do.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.940]   Maybe we'll do it in the future.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.020]   But it's more of a tone, how they build their ships,
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.700]   do they have all the right things for safety?
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:44.220]   We do get into environmental things on the planets,
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.460]   in your space suit, obviously,
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:49.380]   a lot of different space suits and buffs for the gases,
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.880]   the toxicity, or the temperature on various planets.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.320]   - Are there robots?
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.160]   - Yes.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.820]   - Those companions, are they robots by chance?
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.660]   Can you say?
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.960]   - One of the companions is a robot, Vosko, yeah.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.360]   - Okay, so they have a name and a personality and so on.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.920]   - Vosko does, and then there's a whole bunch of,
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.140]   I call 'em generic robots.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.320]   We use them for utility.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.380]   We actually dialed them back, 'cause if you think about,
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.680]   well, you know a lot about this more than me in terms of--
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.300]   - I'm offended right now, you're calling robots generic
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.140]   and you dialed them back. - No, no, no,
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.960]   the ones we use, the ones we use.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   We made them more generic.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.080]   We didn't say actually-- - Sorry, I'm very sensitive
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.720]   about this stuff. - I understand.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.240]   If you were to chart the future, you would say robots
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.920]   would have a much bigger role in our future
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.360]   than we are presenting.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.160]   But that was a tone thing.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.040]   So most of our robots are there as utility robots,
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.760]   and there are some combat ones as well as enemies.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.120]   - So it's a deeply human world.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:52.960]   - Very much, yes.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.280]   - In terms of tone. - Yes.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.100]   - So have you talked to Elon about this game?
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.220]   - A little bit.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.660]   - How much of reality, like the work of SpaceX,
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.820]   is it an inspiration for the decisions made in this game?
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.900]   - I wouldn't say it's for the decisions we made,
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.220]   but visiting SpaceX and walking in there,
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.940]   it was, it's like the Avengers meet NASA.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.160]   It's like the most amazing,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.920]   and here we're building the next gen,
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.040]   like see the dragon stuff before it was,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   other people saw it.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.360]   Like just, I was really in awe.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:41.480]   This giant machine that looks for imperfections
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   on the surface of these giant, you know, fuselage.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.500]   Just whenever, and 'cause we're in DC,
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.160]   go to the Air and Space Museum a lot,
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.420]   and so whenever I look at those kind of things,
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.440]   or you'll visit the space shuttle,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.640]   sort of overcome with how big it is,
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.520]   and I go stand back by the engines
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.440]   and think about that thing leaving orbit.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.800]   And one of the things Elon really impresses,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.640]   we're reaching the edge of physics on a lot of this stuff
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   where how hard it is to leave orbit,
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.640]   the gravitational pull.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.240]   And like so the engineering that has gone into that,
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.660]   our space program, what he's doing now,
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.960]   I just marvel at.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.680]   I don't understand, right, I'm not at that level,
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.540]   but I marvel at the kind of human ingenuity and scale.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:40.380]   I was on the Delaware coast last month,
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.080]   and I went, I was outside for some reason, it was dark,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.240]   and I saw this crazy light in the sky.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.360]   And I thought it was like a helicopter,
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.400]   and then it didn't go away.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.520]   And I'm like, is someone, what is that?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.960]   I call my, we had some friends,
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.560]   hey, does everybody see this?
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.600]   What is that?
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.080]   And we just stood dumbfounded
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.680]   looking at this thing in the sky.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:08.680]   And like that is a UFO, nobody takes their phone out.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.240]   Everyone, I'm with like four people,
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.480]   everyone is too dumbstruck.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.300]   You would think, why don't you take a picture of this thing?
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.800]   And the next day we found out, it was in the news,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.440]   it was the SpaceX launch in Florida.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:26.600]   And I'm seeing it from Delaware, Maryland area.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.840]   It was one of the most, it was incredible.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.040]   It's just even just that, I am in complete awe of.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.200]   - Is there some aspect to that that you can replicate,
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.660]   the majestic nature of that in a video game?
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:43.600]   - I wish I had the answer to that.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.400]   I think some of it we were doing
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.840]   when you're standing on a planet
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.120]   and you see the other moons go by,
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.960]   and then you realize, I could get my ship blast off
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.280]   and land there and build myself a home.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.400]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.720]   There's a minor thing we do,
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.620]   which is we have other ships come and go
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.320]   from the starports when you're there.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.480]   So you'll be in a city and then you hear this,
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.760]   you hear the engine, you look up
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.560]   and a ship is taking off or coming.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.400]   - That's great.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.440]   - There's nothing for you to do,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.800]   but I think it's awesome.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.280]   And then that's all about creating the soundscape,
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.520]   the feel.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.040]   - Seeing it and like, oh, that's real.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.000]   That's a ship that, or you jump into a system
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.560]   and you see these freighters
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.920]   and sometimes they contact you.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.600]   It's not all just like jump in and combat.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.460]   - Do you ever think about the fact
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.260]   that science fiction seems to make,
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:41.000]   it has a way of creating reality,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   not just kind of predicting it or imagining it.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.400]   It's almost like the thing you put out there
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.520]   with a video game like this, like Starfield,
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.560]   that you can't anticipate.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.920]   It kind of fuels people's imagination of what is possible.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.400]   - Maybe, I don't know.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.960]   I don't know, I can't say.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.840]   You're making me think now about other science fiction
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.880]   that, movie I love, "Minority Report."
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.800]   It's more of like a, not a space movie,
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.520]   but more like looking at the future.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.360]   If you look at a lot of the things in that movie,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.120]   it's almost like, I think those are coming true.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   - Yeah.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.760]   I mean, is that the one that you do interface this like--
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.200]   - It's the interfaces and then the,
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.400]   the way he looks as a child's more like a holographic,
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   almost AR, VR kind of thing, or digital billboards,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.000]   or trying to predict human behavior.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.560]   There's just a lot of future stuff in that movie.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.600]   As it comes to sci-fi, to your other question,
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.840]   I don't know, I don't know.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.760]   - Well, I think it does, and it's interesting.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.600]   I mean, I suppose you're trying to create the most realistic,
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.560]   sticking to the tone, the most immersive, realistic world,
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.080]   and almost by accident,
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.120]   you create the thing that is possible,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.840]   because you want it to be realistic in some deep sense.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.080]   So, accidentally it can become the possible,
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.520]   and then that places, that idea in people's heads.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.240]   I mean, if humans are ever to become
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.240]   a multi-planetary species, we need to play games.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.400]   We need to read sci-fi to help imagine that that's possible,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.160]   to look outside of Earth, to look outside,
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.280]   look up on the stars,
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.320]   then we can actually travel out there.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.160]   I don't know, there's power to sci-fi to do that.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.560]   I guess you shouldn't feel the pressure of that.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.000]   - I don't know if I'd make the leap now, that's all,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.720]   that what we're doing might.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.920]   Now, maybe, you know, one of our,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.920]   hopefully it might inspire some young people
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.880]   who are headed in that direction,
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.480]   are like, oh, I thought about getting into space
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.720]   and space exploration, and being an engineer,
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.480]   or doing these things, and I played this game,
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.840]   and it really sparked that interest in me,
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.520]   so I'm gonna go take that as a field,
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.040]   and maybe that's the person who goes
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.560]   and does some of these things.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.600]   - Yeah, because in the next couple decades,
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.360]   likely a human being will step foot on Mars,
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.680]   which are the first steps
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.000]   towards us becoming multi-planetary.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.420]   - And if you read some of the stuff they're doing
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.320]   with the James Webb Telescope,
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.040]   and them being able to look for signs of life
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.360]   on other planets, it's quite fascinating,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.200]   and, you know, recent stuff I read say
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   they think in 20 years they will.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.880]   So it's actually quite encouraging to think,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.760]   I almost have a dream in mind, like in our lifetimes,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.180]   that we discover life on another planet.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.400]   - Yeah, especially if it's intelligent life.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.080]   I've been talking to a lot of biologists,
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.200]   and a lot of folks, I imagine there's life
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.740]   everywhere out there.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.300]   - The numbers would say so, yes.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.820]   - The challenging question is, what it looks like,
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.880]   and how much of it is intelligent.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.400]   So a lot of biologists tell me the big difficult leap
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.120]   is from the Prokaryotes to the Eukaryotes,
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.520]   so like the complex life.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.640]   It could be that a lot of our universe
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.960]   is just filled with bacteria.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.440]   - I believe, if I'm understanding it right,
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.800]   that there's two ways they're gonna look at planets.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.440]   When they can look, you know, they can read,
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.760]   hey, this planet has this kind of gas.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.600]   They can now look at the ones that are created
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.080]   by potential life forms, and then the ones
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.760]   that are created, the byproducts of industry.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.720]   There's only certain ones that are created
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.340]   if you have a society there,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.560]   and that they can start looking on these types of,
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.680]   in these types of star systems, in these planets,
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.720]   but it takes a lot of time, 'cause you have to book time
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.420]   on that telescope, you have to like look at that planet
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.840]   over a long period of time, but in theory,
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.160]   given enough time, given the amount of space out there,
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.560]   we would find one.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.640]   That would be a cool thing in this short life of ours
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.480]   to find out definitively that there is
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   an industrial intelligent civilization out there
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.280]   before you contact them, so like die, end your life,
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.980]   not knowing the rest of the story,
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.520]   but just know that it's out there.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.480]   That's a cool, and then if you have kids,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.940]   be like, well, this one's on you.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.680]   F this, I'm out.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.760]   And I'm fascinated by what it would do to the way,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.920]   I think in a positive way,
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.680]   the way humanity thinks about itself here.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.520]   Like no, there is a definitively other life out there.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.000]   - I mean, both things, if there isn't life out there,
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.960]   that's also a huge responsibility.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.080]   Both are super exciting.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.680]   If we're alone, it's super exciting
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.800]   because there's a responsibility to preserve
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.300]   whatever special thing we have going on here,
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:01.240]   this, whether you call it the flame of consciousness
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.960]   or whether it's consciousness or intelligence,
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.920]   that's a special thing, preserve it, have it expand.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.080]   But if there's others out there,
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   I mean, that sparks that drive for exploration
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.600]   of reaching out into the stars and meeting them.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.240]   Most of them probably wanna kill us.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.680]   But luckily, we have the military industrial complex
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.380]   on Earth that builds bigger and better weapons
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.600]   all the time. - We have Space Force.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.780]   - Space Force.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.860]   It will both protect us and destroy all our enemies.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.100]   (laughing)
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.540]   This is 100% a video game we're living in.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.060]   Okay, back to dragons.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.140]   So blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls VI
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.280]   is coming out, but are not going to tell me.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.180]   - I have a vague idea.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.100]   - Okay, vague idea.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.240]   In, (laughing)
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.460]   so like if you have the quantum mechanical interpretation
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.540]   that allows for multiple universes,
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.800]   in the universe where you didn't blink,
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.900]   what would that, Todd, tell me about the year
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900]   it's coming out?
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.740]   Would it be 2025? - That is a trick question.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.940]   - Or 26? - I've been asked
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:18.100]   that question many ways, but never like that.
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.200]   - Yeah, I thought I would try to sneak it.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.780]   I mean, there is, of course, no answer because--
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.060]   - I wish it was soon.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.860]   - Soon. - Like we don't,
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.980]   we want 'em out too, you know?
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.940]   And I wish they didn't take as long as they did,
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.900]   but they do.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.500]   And look, I mean, if I could go back in time,
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.640]   would never have been my plan to wait
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.620]   as long as it's taken for it.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.980]   - So you love that world, the Elder Scrolls world?
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.740]   - Look, it's part of why I've spent more time there
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.260]   than anything else in my life probably, right?
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:59.260]   So I deeply love it.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.900]   We all do, it's a part of us.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.580]   And when you aren't doing it for a while,
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.640]   you really do miss it.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.180]   And when I look at what we're doing,
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.740]   have planned for that game,
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:16.340]   and I was in a meeting yesterday,
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.920]   I was like, I just wanna play all this right now.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.240]   (Todd laughs)
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.860]   But we're gonna make sure we do it right
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.900]   for everybody, and we do have to approach it.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.460]   People are playing games for a long time.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.680]   You know, Skyrim's 11 years old,
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.580]   still probably our most played game,
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.180]   and so we don't see it slowing down.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.900]   And people will probably be playing it
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.100]   10 years from now also.
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.380]   So you have to think about, okay,
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:49.080]   people are gonna play the next Elder Scrolls game
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.860]   for a decade, two decades.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.060]   And that does change the way you think about
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.940]   how you architect it from the get-go.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.500]   - What are some elements that changed the way,
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.600]   like how do you make a game that's playable for 20 years?
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.300]   - Well, we're trying to figure that out.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.140]   (laughs)
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.020]   - There are some elements, I should pause on that.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:13.340]   You know, pardon me, I'm of course asking,
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.020]   jokingly, I'm excited for it,
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.580]   but I think Skyrim is an amazing game still.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.260]   You know, I really enjoy it still.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.260]   - Yeah, and you know what, the content,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.500]   even if you step away from it for a while,
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.660]   then play, what I'll put, say,
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.420]   the vanilla version without mods.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.100]   If you go and haven't played it in a while,
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.060]   there's always a new way to play it.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.420]   But then if you look at the mods
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.700]   and what creators are doing to it,
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.580]   we think that is just awesome.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.820]   It's something that we've always supported,
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.900]   we're gonna keep supporting.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.240]   We've hired a large number of modders
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.620]   that are now professionals.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.700]   We wanna support the people who are doing it on their own
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.400]   so they can be professionals on their own.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.540]   - How do you create a world that's moddable?
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.940]   So you think of designing the game from the start
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.260]   as that enables mods.
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.940]   So it starts with us, like everything we're doing,
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.140]   okay, a modder, a content creator,
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.620]   is gonna have to do it, use our tools.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.140]   Now we do clean them up for release,
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.980]   'cause if you're like a developer in-house,
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.860]   you can deal with some kludginess
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.980]   when you're putting stuff together.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.820]   When you put it out for people,
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:23.340]   we do clean a lot of it up.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:26.860]   And there's still obviously a learning curve there.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.700]   But look, we have people
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.660]   who've been doing it for 20 years with us.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.940]   - What's involved with modding?
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.380]   I'm actually quite newbish at this.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.580]   - Okay, so you-- - And I'm almost afraid
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.820]   to ask, 'cause now that you explained to me,
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.460]   I fear I will spend a very large amount of time
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.660]   creating mods.
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.340]   - Well, we have an editor you can download on Steam,
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.100]   the creation kit for our games,
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.860]   and then it loads up the world,
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.860]   and you could do something really, really small,
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.860]   like change the color of the weather.
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.980]   And it creates a little plugin file, we call it,
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.780]   you know, a modification to the game.
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:59.260]   And then you can run your game with that.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:03.860]   It's on console now, the mods, not the editing.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.700]   And it's just been incredible.
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.700]   Our community there has been amazing
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.220]   what they do with the games.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.300]   - So a lot of it is the visuals.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.820]   - A lot of people do visual things,
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.580]   'cause it's the easiest thing to do first,
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.100]   or they're building new space.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.780]   There's some great things with,
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:25.020]   like I love the Khajiit follower mod for Skyrim.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.060]   It's awesome.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.900]   There have been quest lines.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.900]   Those things just take a really, really long time.
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.500]   And so someone who's gonna do that,
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.780]   that's almost like it takes them a long time.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.620]   It's more than a hobby.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:43.460]   And we're always looking at ways that we can make it like,
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.820]   hey, they can turn a career into it,
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.660]   'cause it's just awesome.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:53.340]   - What about, is there any possibility in doing a mod
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.980]   for some of the AI stuff?
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   - There is, and I've seen some,
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.100]   but to really move it along,
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.100]   if they're using the tools that we already put out there,
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.820]   so to really move the AI along,
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.420]   you'd have to get in the code,
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.700]   which some people have figured out ways to hack in
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.900]   and do things with script extenders.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.580]   But for the most part, like really pushing it,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.860]   it does take us, which is why you see
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:20.180]   when we have a new game come along,
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.260]   the palette that they have is there's so many more things
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.220]   they can do.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:29.220]   - Well, I've built bots that play the driving games,
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:33.420]   but they do that by just taking, reading the screen
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.500]   and doing basic, not basic, it's actually pretty complicated
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.140]   but computer vision and doing the control,
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:40.980]   but you're basically simulating the human player.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:44.500]   To do that for Skyrim or for some of the open world games,
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.500]   that's literally, you have to create AGI
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.060]   to be able to play those open, well, maybe not,
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.980]   maybe you can create a super dumb,
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.700]   like just a two handed sword
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.900]   and just keep swinging until everybody's dead.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:58.740]   - Look, there's some bot stuff out there that does it.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.900]   We have some very, very dumb bots that we use
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:04.460]   to run through the world to test it,
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.260]   that we'll deploy on a whole bunch of servers
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.260]   just to, we do it every day.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.900]   We run through every space, we're doing it in Starfield.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.220]   And then just running, they're all out there.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.740]   - Well, it does it very quickly.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.940]   It loads up every place in the game
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.980]   and runs around a little bit
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.980]   and then loads the next place and runs around a little bit.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.740]   We're just testing, like, did it crash?
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.580]   What's the memory growth?
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.980]   What's the, get a report,
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:27.420]   here are all the places where the frame rate
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.100]   wasn't up to snuff.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.020]   And then we do have one that will play on its own.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.440]   It's heavily scripted, but it lets us test,
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.420]   every time we make a build,
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.060]   there's a bot that runs through
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.700]   the first one or two main quests.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.260]   Like, it'll just play it.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.860]   That way we know, did we break anything?
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:47.020]   'Cause you don't wanna waste QA's time,
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.620]   like you guys broke it again within five minutes, so yeah.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.940]   - Yeah, so that's for broken stuff.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.900]   I wonder if you can build a bot
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.740]   that estimates the quality of the experience.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.380]   - Oh my gosh, okay, can you do that?
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.300]   - I don't know.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.260]   But just like the number,
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.060]   like how boring or not boring, the boring meter.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.820]   - How many times you die.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:09.740]   - How many times you die.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.620]   - Is death boring or exciting?
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.460]   That's the question.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.940]   I mean, I feel like there's a balance to be struck there,
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.500]   'cause you always want to be in fear of death.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.620]   - Yeah, we always, we have this chart at work we use,
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.660]   which is like, if you think about any game
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.820]   that you've played that you've put down,
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:29.820]   it's either about a frustration/confusion or boredom.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:34.340]   You gotta put the player right in the middle of that.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:37.700]   - But I've sometimes put down games from frustration
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.460]   only to return again stronger.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.620]   - Dark Souls, yeah.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:48.820]   - So I mean, the challenge, that's part of it.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.460]   Well, I don't know, actually, Skyrim, I'm one of those,
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.420]   I mean, I'm sure there's all kinds of humans
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.640]   that you've interacted with about what they enjoy.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.700]   But to me, I could enjoy Skyrim
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.020]   on any difficulty level.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.900]   It doesn't, all of it, so it depends.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:08.340]   The open world nature of it is what's really compelling.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.740]   Not necessarily the challenge
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.940]   of the particular quest and so on.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.340]   But I'm not sure if that's the same experience for everybody.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:16.920]   - Do you play the survival mode?
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.760]   There's a survival mode in Skyrim.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.140]   It was a creation club thing.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.220]   It does some hunger, it does hot and cold,
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.720]   it does some other systems that make it,
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.000]   you know, in our minds, more believable.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.100]   It was actually a creation club thing
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.520]   made by an external creator who is now full-time with us.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.460]   - So can we actually, thinking about Starfield,
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.660]   thinking about Elder Scrolls VI,
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.660]   go through the full life of a video game you've created?
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:53.380]   So what's it take to take a game
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.580]   from the idea to finally the final product?
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.340]   What are the different steps along the way?
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:00.220]   - Great question.
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.620]   Well, usually it starts with,
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.680]   I mean, honestly, lunchtime conversations
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.100]   with a number of us.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.940]   Hey, we think we wanna do this.
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.140]   This is what it's gonna be like.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.420]   I mean, look, with an Elder Scrolls,
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.860]   you know you're gonna do it.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.900]   It's a matter of when.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.780]   You say, okay, what's the tone we're going for, right?
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.340]   Where is it set?
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.300]   So we usually start with the world.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:26.820]   And then we're always overlapping.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.660]   So while we're making one game,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.300]   as we're getting in the throes of it or wrapping it,
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.260]   probably by the midpoint of one game,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.980]   we've had enough conversations
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:44.060]   to understand what the next one's gonna be.
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.460]   What are the big ticket, like, where's it set?
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.820]   What's the tone?
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.740]   Is there a big ticket feature or two
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.320]   that make it really unique?
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.260]   And then when we're finishing one game,
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.140]   we start prototyping.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.100]   Sorry, before that, we start concepting.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.660]   So we'll do concept art.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.100]   And for one reason or another,
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:09.540]   I usually have the beginning of the game worked out.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.700]   I like to think about, okay, how's the game start?
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.060]   What's the player do first?
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.340]   We do music early.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:18.380]   So take Elder Scrolls VI, we forgot where it's set.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.220]   What's the tone?
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.380]   What are the big features?
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.340]   We discuss the beginning of the game,
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.380]   which we've had for a very long time.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:25.980]   - Where's it set again?
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.820]   - Yep.
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:27.660]   (Luke laughs)
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:28.860]   In Tamriel.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.300]   - Damn it.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.460]   Well, at least we know we narrowed it down that.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.300]   - Yeah.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.860]   - That would be epic if it was like
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.780]   a portal into another dimension.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.620]   Anyway.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.200]   - Then I like to do music.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.420]   So we've already done a take on the music
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.900]   for Elder Scrolls VI.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.500]   - So you can sit there with the concept art
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:50.900]   and the music and you can feel it.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.340]   - No, no, the music, we put in the teaser for it.
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.980]   This was 2018.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.700]   We've taken that further, obviously.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.180]   And again, we're working on the world.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:06.020]   You're then doing concepting and design for the world.
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.540]   And then once we're wrapping up one game,
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.540]   we can really start prototyping the new one.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.500]   And you're usually building kind of your initial spaces.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.520]   And so we do like to do like a first playable,
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.820]   a smaller section of the game
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:21.500]   that we can sort of prove out and show to people,
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.100]   hey, this is how it feels different.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:23.980]   This is what it looks like.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.540]   This is what's unique about it.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.300]   Then we turn that into a larger chunk
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.300]   when more of the team comes on, when the other game is done.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.860]   And that's still what we call a VS, vertical slice.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:37.420]   So you still don't have the full team on it.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:40.660]   And it's a larger chunk of the game that you can play.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.380]   And then once you feel good about that,
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:46.260]   you're gonna bring on the rest of the team.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.280]   And we're fortunate that the other games we've done
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.020]   are popular enough that we can be doing DLC and content
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.180]   and those kinds of things while we're getting the one going.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.500]   And then we're at full production
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.060]   where we're sort of at maximum size.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.740]   We just call that production.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.700]   That's like the full production period.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.060]   And that, depending on the game,
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:08.940]   you know, can run a year, two years, maybe more.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:14.020]   And then you kind of have a finalizing final six months
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.900]   to a year on a game, which is,
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.740]   okay, we've built everything now.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:23.100]   And usually it needs a lot of glue
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.300]   where we have a lot of very different elements
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.460]   that maybe aren't clicking together the way you want
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.380]   outside of the regular polish for levels and features.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.500]   And we're shaving and gluing and sticking things together
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.220]   so that it's not the schizophrenic game experience
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.060]   that things flow from one into another.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.180]   - In terms of story, like on that level?
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.940]   - It's really, no, usually the story,
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.700]   the designers have done a really good job.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.580]   It's more about game features, you know,
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.620]   and then how they interact with the story or,
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:53.060]   hey, I went from this experience to this experience,
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.780]   or picking flowers in alchemy feels like a different game
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:01.620]   and then how is another character referencing that?
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.900]   And how is that intersecting with the skill system
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.060]   and the interface?
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.860]   Like the skill system and the interface is the party host.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:14.820]   If you think about a game, most games,
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.340]   particularly what I like to do,
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.900]   is that's your person that says,
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.620]   welcome, do this, go here, check this out.
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.900]   And the skill system and the way it reacts on the HUD,
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.060]   the interface of the game,
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.620]   is sort of leading you to the next thing.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.820]   And once you get that flow down
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:39.580]   and the rate at which the game is giving you activities,
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:43.580]   then you're in like what we describe as a game flow.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   And it's not till really that last year.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.860]   Before that, the game flow was just,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.620]   it doesn't even exist in the way that you see it
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.620]   in the final game.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.460]   And that's what we were working on a lot that last year.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.820]   - So at which point is like the set of skills,
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.460]   a skill tree, the characteristics
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.300]   of the role-playing aspect of it,
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.220]   when is that set, the ideas?
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.660]   - We usually have it in the beginning,
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.220]   but it's just, we know it won't be done
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.100]   until that last year.
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:15.420]   We'll have one, but we know it's gonna get honed
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.620]   because it's not until you really see,
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.500]   okay, how impactful is that one?
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.660]   How much are you doing it?
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.980]   Like how much are you really,
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:25.380]   and the main combat ones, they always win.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.700]   You always know the players will drift
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.940]   toward the combat type skills
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.380]   'cause every character needs some amount of that.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.300]   But okay, well, how important is cooking?
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.500]   How important is alchemy?
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:39.100]   How important is these other type of activities?
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.740]   And then how do you balance them
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.620]   where when you load up the skill menu,
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.860]   it isn't automatically give me plus 10 damage?
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:51.060]   - How do you get the, what about the combat system?
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.860]   That does seem to be an important part of a lot of games.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:56.780]   - You start it in the beginning, yeah, every time, yep.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.180]   So usually when we're making that first playable,
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.260]   it's an area you can go through,
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.860]   some amount of dialogue, some amount of combat.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:06.780]   - How do you get the combat right?
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:09.660]   What's the secret to a great combat system?
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:12.780]   - Well, first on a control side,
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.060]   helping the player when they don't realize it.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:17.940]   There's a lot of tricks you can do with magnetism
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.260]   in terms of the controller and where the attacks go.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:22.540]   So it has to feel, the minute to minute
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.900]   has to feel really good in your hand.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.460]   So there's a lot of animation time, right?
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.660]   And changing animation so they're impactful
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.180]   and they happen at a rate that the player feels
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:35.500]   like they're really doing it.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.620]   And then ultimately it's the illusion
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.340]   that the enemies are smart,
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.020]   but they really are there for you to kill them, right?
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:51.020]   So they do a lot of things to just let themselves get killed.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.900]   They're not near as smart as we can make them
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.740]   'cause it turns out that is not fun.
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:59.780]   - Right, so there's a balance between,
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:04.780]   but that is, I guess, a kind of AI
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:09.380]   and it's a very intimate interaction with an AI
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:11.300]   'cause there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.860]   It's not just very kind of shallow,
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.500]   like a dialogue or something like that.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:19.260]   It's like, there's a time critical nature
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.900]   where a lot of stuff is happening.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:25.180]   And if anything feels off, it's gonna feel wrong.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.940]   - Yep, all the games do it.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.380]   It's not unique to what we do
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.460]   in terms of how they handle combat scenarios.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.140]   And there's some games that just do it extremely well
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:39.060]   in terms of, even in multiplayer where you're playing bots
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.620]   and most people don't know it,
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:46.620]   or how a multiple enemy scenario is really,
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.900]   they don't all shoot you, they trade off.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.740]   They're gonna wait.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.020]   And I was like, "All right, I'll just wait my turn
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.260]   "'cause we don't wanna overwhelm them."
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.660]   But you feel like you're overwhelmed
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.340]   when there's six enemies, but a good game will,
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.540]   no, they're gonna take their time.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.260]   - Is there a science to it?
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.300]   Is it art?
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:08.860]   Is it like, how do you--
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:11.140]   - Yes, I mean, it's all of that.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.540]   - So it's like an iterative process
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.900]   where you try different things, you have different ideas.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.260]   - There's a lot of-- - Mixture of animation.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:20.740]   - There's a lot of timing, animation work, HUD work also.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.580]   How does the reticule change?
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:26.540]   What are the little sound effects?
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:30.460]   - What about the gamify, like that is fun?
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.380]   That aspect. - Again, that goes back
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.220]   to the winning.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:34.820]   - So winning is fun.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.140]   - Yes. - Death is not.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.500]   - Yes, let the Wookiee win.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:39.620]   (laughing)
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.420]   I like how you have to dumb down the AI
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.940]   to make it fun for humans.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:47.700]   Because if you didn't, it would just be just slaughter
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.380]   nonstop for all humans.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.340]   That's good to know.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:56.340]   What about things like, you said cooking, like crafting,
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:03.300]   making potions and poisons and smithing,
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.340]   weapons and armor, cooking?
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.620]   How do you get that right?
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.980]   What's interesting there?
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:13.420]   It's such an interesting, a lot of games
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.980]   don't have that kind of thing.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.700]   So what role does that play in the game's creation?
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.380]   - I think we really cracked it in a way I like
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.020]   with Fallout 4, actually, where when we're doing
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.180]   Elder Scrolls, we have the flowers and things
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.940]   and you have alchemy, and we took this to,
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.220]   okay, if it's post-apocalyptic, what if everything
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:36.620]   in the world was an alchemical ingredient in some kind?
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.460]   So breaking it down to their components.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.780]   So when you walk around a world, again,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.020]   we like the simulation, we like the forks and the spoons
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:43.860]   and the cups and all that.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.380]   Okay, how can I use those to create?
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.620]   So I love how it starts working in Fallout 4,
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:53.780]   where, okay, all these things I find,
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:57.820]   they have some value in creating or crafting
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:02.380]   outside of a cup is worth one gold piece or one cap.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.540]   - By the way, I have to be honest,
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.700]   I haven't played Fallout 4.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.980]   I played Fallout 3.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.780]   I thought that was a legendary game.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.420]   Can you make a case for Fallout 4?
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.740]   Or should I just wait till Fallout 5?
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.580]   And when does that come back?
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.580]   - I think you should play Fallout 4.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.940]   Love to hear your thoughts.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.060]   It's a different game.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:20.940]   - Skyrim is too.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   I mean, it's--
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:23.460]   - We try to make them all different.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.060]   They all have-- - They are fundamentally
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:25.900]   different. - They all have
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.720]   their own tone. - Keep the tone.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.700]   - So Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are intentionally
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.540]   a very different tone.
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:30.380]   - Oh, really?
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.660]   Interesting.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:33.780]   So what's that world like?
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:37.740]   What's the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout,
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.740]   if you can just briefly take a stroll
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.580]   into that world, tone-wise?
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:43.060]   - Well, there's, look, in entertainment,
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.660]   there's a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:50.100]   And what makes Fallout tick is the world
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.300]   that was left behind, the world that blew itself up,
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:56.380]   this utopian world of nuclear energy,
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.460]   and it all goes wrong.
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:00.700]   So I love the American dream of that,
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.180]   like how they visioned the future in the '50s
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.620]   and that blowing itself up.
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:08.620]   I think that's a super interesting place to explore,
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.520]   which is why we always wanted to play in that world.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.740]   And it does an amazing job of sort of weaving
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:21.220]   the drama and darkness of a post-apocalyptic world
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.520]   with B-movie humor.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:30.980]   Winks at the camera sometimes, often, actually.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.980]   And that when you're in that world,
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:41.300]   it just has its own unique flow and vibe
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:45.020]   outside of anything else kind of in that genre.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.660]   - So Elder Scrolls has, or at least Skyrim has,
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.300]   some humor.
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.220]   - Has a little bit.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.540]   - But Fallout leans into it a little more.
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.100]   - A little bit more, a little bit more.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.660]   Yeah, yeah, it does.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.900]   It's like ironic humor.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:57.860]   It's the duck and cover.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.940]   It's a get under your desk if the bomb comes
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.500]   and everything will be fine.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.840]   It's that type of humor.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.100]   - So the funny thing is, I do think Fallout 3
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.820]   is one of the greatest games ever.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.220]   You've said that, quote,
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:13.220]   "When we started Fallout 3 in 2004,
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:16.000]   "we obviously had big ideas of what we could do with it,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.820]   "and I talked to a lot of people,
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.960]   "from ex-developers to press folks to fans,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.220]   "what made it special?
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:26.180]   "What are the key things you'd want out in a new one?
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.100]   "The opinions," and I'll put this mildly, "varied a lot,
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.020]   "but they would all end the same,
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.860]   "like a stern father pausing for effect,
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.820]   "but do not screw it up."
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.340]   How do you not screw up a game?
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.300]   You have not screwed up many games yet.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.260]   - I mean, back to the Fallout one.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.100]   - Yeah.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.100]   - Yeah, that was, look, I remember that.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.140]   We were met with a lot of skepticism in terms of,
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.820]   "Oh, what are they gonna do with this?"
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.820]   It was a beloved kind of isometric,
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.340]   turn-based role-playing game.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.660]   You know, awesome for when it came out.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.300]   And actually, it was announced,
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.700]   we had finished Morrowind, but not announced Oblivion.
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.780]   But because we'd acquired the rights,
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.420]   we had to announce it,
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:14.060]   'cause I think Interplay was a public company.
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:15.620]   I don't remember.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.220]   I just remember we had to announce it,
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:18.340]   and we're thinking there,
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:21.480]   "Well, we're gonna piss off all the Elder Scrolls fans,
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.780]   "'cause we're announcing a Fallout game.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:25.460]   "We're probably gonna piss off the hardcore Fallout fans,
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.820]   "'cause we didn't make the original,
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:30.500]   "and clearly we'll probably make a different kind of game."
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.620]   So I do remember, you know,
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:37.260]   there was a lot of concern with all of our fans,
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.580]   and fans of Fallout at the time.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.580]   And so, I think it was pretty rewarding for us
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:49.400]   that that game found the audience and success that it did.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.420]   It's one of my favorite projects that I've ever worked on.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:57.660]   And because it was so fresh for us,
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:59.780]   and we had a very clear,
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:01.140]   even before we had the rights,
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:03.300]   this is the game we're gonna make.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.540]   This is the kind of thing we're gonna do.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.940]   And we had done Morrowind,
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.740]   and we were working on Oblivion.
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:13.460]   And it was kind of a breath of fresh air to do it.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.220]   And what's kind of remarkable is,
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:19.820]   Fallout 3 comes out just two and a half years after Oblivion.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:21.740]   And we did all this DLC for Oblivion.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.660]   So we were really, really kind of prolific
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.660]   in how our development, how it was going.
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:32.660]   So, I just remember enjoying making that game so much,
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:37.900]   'cause it was, everything we were doing was new.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:40.500]   - Which, as to the world creation,
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:42.020]   was there some innovation,
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:43.500]   like technically that was happening to it?
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500]   - The world creation, like it was, you know,
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.820]   obviously a different look,
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.060]   even though some of us,
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:51.260]   very few of us had worked on the Terminator things.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.540]   The VAT system, the skill system,
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.660]   and we loved the original game so much.
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.460]   So you felt this responsibility
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:00.460]   to bring it back in a big way,
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.740]   and reintroduce it in a way that, you know,
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:07.780]   as much as we could, scratch the same itch
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.020]   when you played the original game,
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.900]   that it had the same tone.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:14.860]   - Are there some favorite things to you about that world
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.260]   that just kind of connect you to the humor?
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.700]   - Fallout 3, I love,
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.380]   again, I usually start with the beginning.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.820]   I love the beginning.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.620]   I love the character generation.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.740]   If you go, if you played it a lot,
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.180]   or you're developing it,
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.780]   it starts to feel really long.
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:31.620]   But the first time you play it, or second,
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.380]   I just think it's awesome.
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:37.900]   And this idea, it's a hard thing to say,
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:42.900]   okay, we want you to feel like your character on the screen.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:44.340]   Even when you play like a Skyrim,
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.860]   you don't know what you were doing before that.
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:50.900]   But Fallout 3, you were born in the vault,
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:53.020]   and you raised in the vault, and you lived in the vault,
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.300]   but you experience a part of that.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.380]   So it's a very different, when you step out,
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.820]   I think you're really,
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:02.900]   I mean, the visuals are the visuals,
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.460]   but the emotional moment of stepping out of the vault,
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.780]   you feel like you lived your whole life in the vault.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:13.540]   - And you feel like you have a sense of your past.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.980]   - Right, and I need to find my father.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:20.420]   - Isn't it possible to have that sense
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:23.660]   with Elder Scrolls, like a life story,
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.500]   like childhood trauma and stuff?
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.420]   Back to the human condition.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.020]   - I mean, you'd have to, look, you do some of that stuff,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:31.300]   but they go through menus.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:32.140]   Pick your background.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.100]   We're doing that in Starfield.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:33.940]   Hey, pick your background.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.340]   What were you doing before this moment?
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.900]   - Can you pick your traumas and stuff?
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.260]   (laughing)
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.780]   - Say hey, if you wanna make a mod, you wanna make a mod.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:41.620]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.660]   - Go for that.
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.500]   - And then also make a mod for a therapist.
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.620]   - But a lot of it is in your head,
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:47.540]   so you're gonna pick this background,
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.380]   and you do these things,
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.820]   and you're sort of like, this is who I was.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.420]   And we intentionally with Elder Scrolls
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:54.660]   kind of make it as much of a blank slate.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.860]   Elder Scrolls is a little bit more of a blank slate game
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.140]   to who you are, which has a lot of positives,
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.420]   and Fallout for us has been more of a,
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:04.540]   this was your life before.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.140]   Here's who you were.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:08.620]   Go be who you wanna be, but this is the background.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.400]   It's a little more strict.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.660]   - Now, this might reveal something about me,
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:18.540]   and speaking of childhood trauma,
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:23.540]   but I feel like there's a lot of the meaningful experience
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:28.180]   of a role-playing game is not just the development
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:30.200]   of the character throughout the game,
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.060]   but the initial character creation, like you said.
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:35.780]   Is there something to that process
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:39.380]   that you found to be powerful?
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.180]   Like the design of that process,
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.480]   because you think so much about that beginning.
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.740]   How much should be controlled?
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.960]   How much should be defined?
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.820]   The interface itself?
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:53.500]   The visual appearance of the character, too?
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.980]   'Cause I feel like that you're loading in,
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:58.940]   you start to load in the world that you're about to enter
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.660]   by creating that character, right?
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:03.620]   - Yeah, we think about it a lot.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.960]   It's a really, really good comment and question.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:12.380]   And it's more than, it has to set the whole stage.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.800]   Has to peak your interest for the world you're gonna enter.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:21.740]   And we've done it so many different ways
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:26.740]   in terms of when you actually go to make your character,
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.740]   when you're making the choice.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:35.140]   And one of the things over time that we've wanted to avoid
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.520]   is people starting over.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.200]   So there's a lot of intentionality around
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.360]   the types of choices you have
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.160]   that can be undone or not undone.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.280]   'Cause what game players want to is,
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:53.200]   I'll play it and then I'll make a new character.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.960]   But sometimes they do that because they realize
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:58.200]   they made the wrong type of character.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:01.900]   And as a designer, you don't want that to happen.
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:07.400]   So some people, and we get this comment in Elder Scrolls,
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.760]   like, oh, you simplified it.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.360]   No, no, no, no, we moved those choices into the gameplay
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.920]   so that you don't make this character in the beginning
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:19.960]   and then eight hours later realize
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.320]   you make a horrible mistake.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.200]   And so, okay, I'm gonna start out like that,
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:26.360]   to me is a really, really bad experience.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.280]   - Also like life itself, but yes, go ahead.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.040]   - But like life is, okay, so you can then--
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.200]   - Fix it in game.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.360]   - Right, I wish I had learned archery.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.320]   - Well, I'm gonna start tomorrow.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.000]   So you can do that, like the Skyrim character system,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.320]   it was really designed around that.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.200]   All you pick is like, what's your race?
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.760]   And that gives you some things,
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.120]   but there's nothing you can't get then on your own.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.120]   Mostly, it sounds weird, but you mostly want that
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.520]   beginning character generation to be visual,
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:03.480]   which you then can also change in the game.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.800]   And some starting skills that get you off
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.440]   to the type of play that you want,
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:13.400]   but if you discover you don't like that type of play
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.600]   as you play, you can move your character along.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   So we have moved away, post-Oblivion, to a classless,
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.120]   meaning you don't have a strict character class,
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.840]   warrior, mage, thief, whatever, in our games.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.840]   - And that's continuing for the,
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.520]   are you like thinking of Elder Scrolls VI,
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.080]   you're already thinking about that kind of stuff?
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.560]   So you think of early on, like you said,
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.360]   the first few experiences in the game,
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.560]   you're already thinking through them.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.600]   - Yeah, yeah, we know what the first few hours are like,
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.600]   we know what the character system is basically like.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:57.320]   - So tonally, what's the difference to you
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:01.600]   between Oblivion, Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   and Elder Scrolls VI?
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.520]   - Like, to me, man, stuff blends together.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.360]   - Yeah.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.360]   - But Oblivion, that's when you could make spells and stuff.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.560]   - You could, you could do it in Morrowind as well.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.360]   Oblivion has some more guardrails on it.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.960]   Morrowind's where you can really go, and Daggerfall.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.520]   I don't remember if you can make spells in Arena.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.120]   I think you can.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.200]   Someone will correct me.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.840]   You definitely can in Daggerfall, it gets crazy.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.640]   Morrowind, you can somewhat.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.640]   And then we start putting guardrails on it,
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.920]   'cause people started breaking the game in certain ways.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.480]   - Yeah, why is it bad to break the game?
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.280]   Like, you always want it to be--
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.920]   - Well, there's like one people love in Morrowind
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:47.640]   where you can make these recall stones,
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.840]   and you could teleport to different areas,
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.320]   which you really need in that game.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.000]   It breaks so many quests.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:55.840]   - Yeah.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.280]   - And so as we, any quests, we would do this exercise
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.480]   of designing a quest, and then someone would say,
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.880]   "And then I recall away."
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.400]   And you're like, "Oh, okay, the quest is broken."
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.940]   And then one day someone says,
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.880]   "Can we just get rid of that spell effect?"
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.600]   Everyone's like, "Yes, please."
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.560]   And so it allowed us to make better content.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.520]   - So, a tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.840]   How do you create a compelling quest?
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.160]   'Cause there's all kinds of personalities of humans
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.760]   that play these games, right?
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.000]   'Cause I like the grind.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.040]   - Well, there's, look, there's multiple flavors
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.300]   of a compelling quest.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.960]   Some of them have very good upfront storytelling.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:38.560]   You just like the story and the NPC
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.800]   that's giving you this task.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.040]   And you'll go through a more handcrafted experience
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.360]   that the designers have done a really, really good job
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.640]   on the space.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.920]   It has some twist or surprise in the middle,
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   and then the ending has some multiple options
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.920]   that the player feels like they got to do something,
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.520]   they made an interesting choice.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.320]   But the best ones for me are actually where
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.280]   all of that was far more open-ended.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.680]   The how I am going to accomplish this task
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:18.280]   is completely up to me,
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.880]   and I'm gonna find some ingenious solution.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.600]   A silly, this sounds very basic.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.800]   It's gonna sound quite cliche and silly.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.720]   It's like, "Go find me five daedric hearts," or whatever.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:33.280]   Like, "Find me X of something that's hard to get."
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.600]   It's a very simple,
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.720]   you can give a simple story set up for that.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.800]   And we're not telling the player where to get those,
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.040]   and they're thinking, "Now, where could I get those?"
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.520]   And I actually find those to be just as rewarding
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.760]   as the really handcrafted, well-done,
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.020]   little bit more linear with an interesting choice
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:57.840]   at the end, if those objects are in the world
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:00.600]   in some believable way,
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.000]   that there's usually some challenge at getting them.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.240]   - How do you place objects in a world in an interesting way?
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.880]   'Cause it's a big part.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.760]   - We have a level design.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.360]   You cannot, people, if they only knew how much we spend,
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.120]   we have a clutter group, a group of people who clutter.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.520]   - What's clutter?
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.720]   - Clutter is all the stuff around.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.400]   It's like interior decorators for treasure and stuff
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.020]   and trash, and they go through every space
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.080]   and they clutter it.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.400]   Our level designers think about it a lot.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.520]   These also become landmarks for the player
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.000]   when you're walking through a space and,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.480]   "Oh, this is the place with this."
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.940]   And there is a logic to making a good level,
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.160]   as they say, with, even if you walk by
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.800]   like a little T intersection,
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.440]   that becomes like a decision point in the player's head.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.300]   Like, "Oh, I didn't go down that way."
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.640]   But the more you do that, it looks easy on paper,
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.520]   but when you're playing a game,
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.440]   you actually kind of want to limit those
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.120]   because he's trying to keep track
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.040]   of all these decision points, then they get lost.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.280]   And yes, we have maps, but anytime the player's going
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.960]   to check a map in a place like that,
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.900]   I feel that it's more of like a backstop
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.880]   for certain players.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.200]   If they need to check the map,
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.880]   I feel like we've kind of failed.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.200]   - Got it.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:25.500]   There's a momentum to it, just pulls them in.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:26.340]   It doesn't feel like they're-
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:27.160]   - And you know, look, you played a lot of games,
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.580]   you played a lot of levels where you're just like,
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.260]   "I'm a little confused," or, "I don't know."
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:31.740]   And you play other levels where like,
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:34.100]   "Man, it was great.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:34.920]   "I went through it.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.040]   "It was well-balanced.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.700]   "I knew where I was going."
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.860]   And you don't want to ever be mazy.
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.340]   As long as you know where you're going,
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.020]   as long as you know you made those choices,
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.460]   then it feels fine.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.360]   But as far as the treasure and all of the loot,
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.620]   it is really an art.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.060]   We will not do enough clutter,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.140]   and then we will over clutter,
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.740]   and then there's too much stuff everywhere,
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.220]   and then we declutter every single game.
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.860]   I wish we got better at it.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.460]   It would save us a lot of time.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:06.140]   - But you're constantly going by feel,
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.300]   like this is not, this is too much, this is not enough.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:10.560]   - Right, right, because the other thing is,
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.720]   look, it creates, people want to pick everything up.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.220]   They want to click everything.
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:19.580]   So if you have too many things of importance in a room,
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:22.060]   it's like, it actually makes you feel
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.300]   a little tight as a player.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.860]   You're like, "Well, I'm basically an idiot
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.460]   "if I don't pick all this stuff up."
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.300]   You probably felt this way.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.140]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.380]   - And the moment where you decide,
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:34.200]   that you're just like, "I've clicked so many things
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.500]   "in this room, I actually am gonna leave
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.780]   "that ammo canister there," but you feel like a dope.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.660]   You've probably experienced this.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:45.180]   - Yes, but also you have a joy from,
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:47.140]   if there's not many items, and you found the one,
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.100]   and you got it, and you feel good.
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:49.940]   - I got it.
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:50.760]   - And then it's finding, like,
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.940]   "Oh, I stuck my head in this corner,
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:54.500]   "and I picked this lock, and I opened this locker,
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.340]   "and oh, there was this thing I've been waiting for."
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:01.420]   - Yeah, what about rare and rare items?
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.820]   - That's an art, even more so of an art.
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:07.860]   I will say we have a ways to go there
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.480]   in terms of finding the right drop rate
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.780]   for special items, we call them,
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:16.140]   and your epic rare legendary.
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:19.020]   You look at games, so many games do it,
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:23.020]   and there are ones that you just play and love
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.260]   'cause they have it down.
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.580]   Destiny 2 is great at it.
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:32.100]   Diablo, a series I love, sort of famously,
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.580]   Diablo III, which I think is great,
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:36.460]   and they did an update, it mostly just changed
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:39.540]   the loot drops, and it's like this whole new experience,
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:42.100]   and there's a really, real art to it.
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.600]   I think that we're still learning.
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.740]   We're still learning a lot, and we're trying
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:49.000]   to get better at it 'cause it's one of those things
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.540]   where it drives you through the game.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.020]   It's fun to get the treasure in.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.840]   - Diablo and Skyrim have this interesting quality
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.200]   of being extremely popular,
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.300]   and there's a lore around rare items,
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:08.540]   so it changes the dynamic of you could afford
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.440]   to have really rare items,
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.280]   - Yes.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.460]   - and then somebody finds it,
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.300]   and that becomes a thing.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.040]   I mean, as you release a game,
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:22.120]   a lot of people play, and they start sharing stories,
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:22.960]   and so on.
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.200]   It's so interesting 'cause that's part
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.920]   of the game experience is the stories of others, right?
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.640]   - For us, 100%.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.160]   Because we've been classically,
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.820]   with most of our stuff, single player,
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.360]   that that water cooler shared experience,
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.960]   we would have a thing where we call them
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.320]   did you know moments.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.340]   Like, we gotta have a bunch.
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:42.560]   So, you meet someone, they do, what are you doing?
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.880]   And then they say, did you know?
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.200]   If you go here and do this, what did you know?
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.200]   And that, to us, is where a lot of our community
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.680]   has been sharing their stories,
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:58.200]   and here's what you can do.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.960]   - Has there ever been a temptation to create
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.720]   not a single player game that's gigantic,
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.100]   that's open world? - Well, we did Fallout 76.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:11.080]   We have Elder Scrolls Online, not a game I created,
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:14.460]   but look, that started as more classic MMO.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.120]   Know the folks, they're part of our company
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.140]   who made that game.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:21.160]   And it's insanely, insanely popular.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.840]   - It is, okay, so I should try it out.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:25.080]   - They do some great storytelling quests.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:27.520]   Like, the actual mechanics aren't the same as Skyrim,
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.880]   but the world is awesome.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.880]   They've just done an incredible job.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.680]   You know, it's about to be 10 years for that game as well.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.000]   And it's just, you know, great community around that.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]   - Yeah, it's, I haven't played,
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.620]   'cause there's a mobile Fallout game, right?
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.220]   I need to play that.
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.940]   I was thinking of playing Diablo Mobile too.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.620]   - I mean, you can debate the monetization,
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.180]   but I would not, it's, I think they did a phenomenal,
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.380]   it's really fun. - On Fallout?
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.660]   What's it? - Diablo.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.980]   - Oh, Diablo? - Yeah, well, Fallout,
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:00.300]   I definitely recommend that one.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.580]   Fallout Shelter, completely different game.
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:05.780]   Diablo Immortal is, I was very, very impressed with it.
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:06.980]   I had a lot of fun. - On the mobile?
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.220]   - Yeah. - What's the challenge
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:12.300]   of designing a game for mobile versus the PC and console?
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.340]   - Well, obviously the screen size, right?
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:16.840]   - Is that what you feel first?
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:21.840]   What's the fundamental change in the philosophy of design?
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.560]   Does it constrain, does it change the tone of the game?
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.140]   - Well, we've done a few things,
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:31.220]   and we have a new mobile game that we're working on
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:34.020]   that we haven't announced yet that I'm in love with.
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.300]   There are a couple of things that you approach on mobile.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.380]   Now, I can give you sort of the classic mobile gaming thing
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.380]   than what we do.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:46.900]   You know, a classic mobile gaming
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:51.300]   is really for short play sessions.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:56.780]   'Cause for the amount of people you're gonna get,
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:00.140]   the number that have the amount of time to sit there
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.740]   for a long time and play it,
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.140]   like a console game or a PC game, is lower,
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.460]   'cause people are playing mobile games
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.180]   on the move or whatever.
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:09.540]   And how it onboards you,
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:11.140]   'cause obviously most of them are free,
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:16.140]   so how the tutorial works, how it gets you into the game,
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.380]   because you haven't bought it,
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.060]   you haven't done this investment of buying it
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.820]   and then saying, "No, I'm gonna learn it."
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.020]   People don't care.
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:24.460]   So really understanding how they get into the game.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:28.140]   Those two things are really the magic to mobile gaming.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:29.740]   We have found, though, with our games,
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.860]   you know, particularly "Fallout Shelter,"
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.580]   people will sit there for an hour or two.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.520]   Like, they will just sit there and play it.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.660]   Like, large numbers of people will play it for hours a day.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:42.540]   - So there is a more, I don't know,
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.420]   addicting element to the mobile?
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:45.740]   'Cause I guess you can spend more time with it.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.860]   - And if you look at, you know,
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.740]   if you look at kids these days,
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:51.340]   they can stare at their phone for hours.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.180]   That's all they do.
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.560]   That's where they watch everything.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.980]   So it's also like a demographic thing.
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.740]   The younger audience,
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:00.280]   they would rather sit and stare at their phone
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:02.900]   than play it on a big screen.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:05.980]   - I would just love to sort of list out
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:09.240]   throughout human history the evolution of sentences
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.700]   that began with, if you look at kids these days.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:12.940]   (laughing)
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.820]   - It's true, it's true.
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.340]   - The kids of the kids these days
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.060]   will probably be talking about,
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.660]   be doing like virtual reality.
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.940]   - Like, I love mobile games, though.
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:24.580]   I play a ton of 'em.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:28.940]   I am, like, my favorite game this year is "Marvel Snap,"
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:32.340]   this card game from the folks who did "Hearthstone."
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.540]   You should really play it.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:35.580]   If you like, do you like card games?
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:36.420]   - Yeah.
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:37.340]   - Do you like superheroes?
[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:38.180]   - No.
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:39.000]   - It's genius.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:39.840]   - You don't like superheroes?
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:41.140]   - No, I don't like superheroes.
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:43.380]   I never understood, listen, this never,
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:47.020]   this is growing up in the Soviet Union.
[01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:49.340]   What, I don't understand the,
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.060]   all right, well, I don't understand,
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:54.020]   you're wearing a costume, it's silly to me.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:56.900]   I can't, so you have to suspend,
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:01.140]   like, you have to be able to immerse yourself,
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:03.700]   and for some reason there's something about costumes,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.680]   it doesn't get me.
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:06.780]   But then again, I'm like into elves and dragons,
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.740]   so I don't understand, and I'm fine.
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:09.720]   - I think I get it.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:13.040]   - Yeah, but the rest, at least the American,
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.040]   the Western world disagrees with me, so.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.960]   Even Batman, you have, like, little ears,
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.320]   but all right, that's fine.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:26.740]   Well, back to "Elder Scrolls Starfield."
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.920]   So one thing I didn't ask you about,
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.960]   when you look at the timeline of five, six, seven,
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.440]   eight years, whatever it is, to create a game,
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:38.240]   what's the role of the deadline internally,
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.060]   not publicly announced? - Keeps you honest.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:43.140]   - Do you try to keep, in your own brain, a deadline,
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.780]   for the team, a deadline?
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.400]   - Yeah, all the time.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.360]   - And when you set that deadline early in the development,
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.140]   do you try to set deadline, like,
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.660]   that's really tough to reach?
[01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:58.300]   - No, we try to make it, like, hey, this is our best guess.
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.140]   If you make it tough to reach, it's sort of,
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:02.560]   you know you're gonna miss it, it's arbitrary.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:05.620]   We really try to, you know, keep ourselves honest,
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:08.000]   'cause it'll let you know where you're at, right?
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:08.980]   We wanna have first playable,
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:11.180]   we wanna be done with prototyping or design by this date,
[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:13.260]   we wanna have first playable this date, we wanna have this.
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.500]   But, look, you know, things happen.
[02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:18.700]   Pandemic happens, people go home, it throws everything off.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.580]   Or, you know, what you needed to do,
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.060]   because we're not just like making a game
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.140]   and then moving everybody on, you know,
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:27.660]   what you needed to do, like Skyrim was so popular,
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.380]   we kept people on that game for longer.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:31.940]   So it delayed a little bit,
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.540]   we were doing with "Fallout 4" at the time,
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:35.800]   'cause we can't, you know, hey,
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.100]   we really shouldn't move the people on to "Fallout" yet,
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.420]   'cause we're doing these things in Skyrim and we should.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:43.940]   So it just sort of keeps you honest for where you're at.
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:46.700]   - Does it get super stressful as you get closer?
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.460]   You try to avoid announcing anything?
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:49.660]   Is there a temptation to announce?
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:51.260]   - Well, I've done it all ways, right?
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.540]   I've announced, you know, "Starfield,"
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.980]   we were pretty loud with a release date
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:58.660]   that we then had to delay, so.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:01.020]   - Was that tough?
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.700]   - It was, it was, but it was the right thing to do.
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.960]   - How do you know it's the right thing to do?
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.280]   Like when you sat down and looked at it,
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.080]   like, this is not ready?
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.920]   - It's not an exact science,
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.960]   but you can look at what needs to be done
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.820]   and the amount of time you have.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.360]   And, you know, we've done it in the past
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.480]   where we can get it done, we believe we can.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.960]   And so you're fighting that personal belief
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.360]   that you can get something done.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.800]   But there's a lot of things that go into release date
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.160]   with marketing and publishing.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.540]   And, you know, we've reached a point where on "Starfield"
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:41.100]   where it was pretty clear to us,
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.220]   even though you wanna say you can get it done,
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:47.540]   that the risk involved with that to the fans,
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:49.220]   to the game, to the team, to the company,
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:52.220]   we're part of Xbox now, to everybody was,
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:57.220]   we should really move it and give it the time it needs.
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:02.340]   - So you mentioned part of Xbox,
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:07.340]   Microsoft bought Bethesda and ZeniMax for $7.5 billion.
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:14.020]   Well, what's it like joining the Xbox team?
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:17.420]   You've, I think, written about it.
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:22.300]   What are the exciting aspects of that?
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:25.780]   - You know, when your company goes through a change like that
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:26.760]   no matter what it is,
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.500]   even if it's somebody that you've worked with
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.120]   for a long time, you never know what you're in for.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.020]   You hope, and I had worked with them for,
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.700]   since we started doing console stuff with "Morrowind"
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:40.700]   was, you know, they came to us, came to me and,
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:42.740]   "Hey, you should make this game for the Xbox."
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:45.200]   And so when they were making that console,
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.580]   had a great experience with them.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.860]   And then on the 360 with "Oblivion,"
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.820]   and so I guess the point is,
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.740]   we felt that we had a very good relationship
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:57.220]   with everybody there,
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:00.300]   and we understood what their culture was,
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:01.700]   but you never really know.
[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:06.220]   And I mean this honestly, it's been awesome.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:09.220]   That the culture inside of Microsoft and Xbox
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:12.120]   that people see from the outside is the culture inside,
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:14.180]   the way they talk about players,
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.140]   the way they'll invest in the players,
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.060]   the risks they'll take,
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:23.320]   the thoughtfulness from Phil Spencer on down
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:27.020]   has been, you know, Phil really, really lucky.
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:28.660]   And then a game like "Starfield" where,
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:30.300]   look, we've had a lot of success
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.860]   with the games that you talked about,
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:36.240]   but we've never been kind of the platform seller,
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.580]   you know, the game for a platform for a period of time.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:43.580]   And so, you know, there is a lot of pressure there.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.860]   There's a lot of responsibility there
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:46.900]   to make sure we deliver for everybody.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:51.620]   - Is there a chance that "Starfield" is exclusive to Xbox?
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:52.740]   - It is exclusive.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.060]   - It's officially ready. - Xbox PC, yep, yes.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:57.580]   - So you're...
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:03:59.700]   I get it.
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:03.420]   So extra pressure also creating a new world.
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:05.540]   - Yeah, it's new, but keep in mind,
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:08.340]   for us that exclusivity is not unique,
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.940]   even though we've done PlayStation stuff.
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:12.500]   And I think the PlayStation 5 is just an insane machine.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.900]   They've done a great job
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:16.580]   and we've had great success on PlayStation.
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:21.100]   We were traditionally a PC developers in the beginning.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.540]   We transitioned to Xbox, became our lead platform.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.700]   Like "Morrowind" is basically exclusive to Xbox.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.740]   "Oblivion" was exclusive to Xbox for a long period of time.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:31.260]   "Skyrim" DLC was exclusive.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.380]   So we've done a lot of like,
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:33.900]   our initial stuff is all Xbox.
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:36.300]   So we get into development and saying,
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:37.460]   we're focused on Xbox
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.500]   and it's not abnormal for us in any way.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:42.900]   It's been kind of the norm.
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:46.460]   And from a development side, I, you know,
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.180]   I like the ability to focus.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:52.180]   So our ability to focus and say, and have help from them,
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:54.500]   you know, the top engineers at Xbox to say,
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:58.900]   we are gonna make this look incredible on the new systems
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.460]   is like, from my standpoint, it's just awesome.
[02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:04.780]   - What's the difference in creating the console
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:05.660]   versus the PC?
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:10.340]   I also have to admit, I've never, is this shameful?
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:11.580]   Actually, you should recommend to me.
[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:13.060]   I've never played "Skyrim"
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:17.420]   or any of the games you've created on Xbox.
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:18.260]   - Really?
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.380]   - Yeah, and on console.
[02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:21.500]   I played, I mean, I've played very little Xbox.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.340]   - Yeah, sure.
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:24.420]   I mean, look, there's the obvious interface part.
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:25.700]   - Yeah. - Between mouse and keyboard
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:27.300]   and then a controller.
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:30.940]   But when you're looking at hardware, PCs, it's tough, right?
[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:32.500]   'Cause you're looking at, well,
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.700]   you know, what are their driver versions?
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.580]   You know, what kind of monitor do they have?
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:41.020]   What is the actual refresh rate of X, Y, and Z?
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:43.540]   We're used to it.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:44.500]   - Yeah. - But if, you know,
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.860]   anyone will tell you, give me the hardware
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:49.900]   that I know I'm writing it for, you know this.
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:54.900]   And the Series X is just a incredible machine.
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:57.700]   And now that- - And you know what it is.
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:58.820]   You know- - You know what it is.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:00.500]   And now that we're part of Xbox,
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:03.340]   getting the people who built it to show you
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.260]   how to make it really, really dance is just awesome.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:10.220]   - Is there a case to be made?
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:12.300]   Do you get people that enjoy,
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:14.500]   people that do both PC and Xbox,
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.340]   that enjoy Xbox more?
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:18.300]   Like if they have a choice- - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.700]   - That they enjoy it?
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.300]   - I think that depends on,
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:25.100]   and look, now that you can kind of cross,
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.620]   you can take your save and go between and all those things.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:28.860]   - You can? - Yeah.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:33.220]   Depends on if- - For which games?
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:34.940]   So for Skyrim?
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:39.700]   - If you have the Game Pass PC version of it versus Steam.
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:41.500]   Not via Steam right now.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.460]   Not via Steam. - Got it, got it.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.660]   And so there's the Game Pass.
[02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:44.900]   So I'm like learning about this.
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:48.020]   So there's a Microsoft, so this is gonna be on Game Pass.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:50.500]   And then you can, yeah, if you can take it from PC
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:52.260]   through Game Pass- - But I think it depends on,
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:57.140]   like for me, what's my physical mood?
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:58.660]   Do I wanna lean back on a sofa?
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:06:59.500]   - Exactly. - Right?
[02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:01.700]   Like the actual physicality of it
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.540]   is what determines where I wanna play.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:07.460]   Do I wanna be two feet from a thing right now?
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:09.020]   And sometimes I like that.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:12.220]   I am more of a console player just because
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:14.060]   I sit at my PC at work all day.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:17.100]   Like I play a lot of video games.
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.980]   So when I get home and I wanna play something else,
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:22.420]   like I am a sofa, screen, controller person.
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:26.100]   - Let me ask you a ridiculous question.
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:28.340]   So you've created some of the greatest games ever.
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:31.260]   I think there's, the question would be
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:32.940]   what's the best game of all time?
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:34.660]   All right, all right, just give me a second.
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:36.340]   - Tetris. - Tetris?
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.180]   All right, yeah, that's interesting.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:38.620]   - Have you read the book on Tetris?
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:39.820]   - No. - You should read it.
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.340]   Basically someone who grew up in Russia.
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.980]   - Yeah, I'm sure there's an interesting story.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:46.620]   The fact that there's a book about Tetris
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:47.700]   is fascinating.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:49.100]   Is there a book about Mario?
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:53.380]   I would love to find out more,
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:57.220]   but I think I would put, personally I would put Skyrim.
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:58.540]   - I'll take that, good answer.
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:01.580]   - At number one for me,
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.740]   which is tough, however you put it,
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:06.060]   'cause you could also make the case
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:08.420]   out of the Elder Scrolls series.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:09.780]   Like what do you actually value more?
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:12.420]   If you put Tetris and Super Mario up there,
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:16.380]   then like the credit goes to Morrowind maybe over Skyrim.
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:18.700]   I don't know where the biggest leaps are,
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.660]   but overall I think it's Skyrim.
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.980]   But for you, if you're not allowed to pick
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:27.340]   any of the games you were involved with,
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.700]   what are some interesting candidates for you
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:34.700]   that are just games that inspired the world,
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:37.420]   impacted the world, shook the world
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:40.140]   in terms of what video games are able to do?
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.340]   - Well, first, I'm just sort of like hearing you say
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:46.180]   that you think Skyrim's the best game of all time
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:49.380]   is quite, like thank you.
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:52.300]   And it's an incredible thing to hear.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:57.780]   And when I think about,
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:59.540]   well, I have a couple of answers.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:01.700]   There's ones that are like personal to me.
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.220]   Ultima VII is probably my--
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:04.340]   - Yeah, can you talk about Ultima?
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.500]   Like you said that as an inspiration.
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:09.660]   I never crossed that world.
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:12.100]   - Well, it was-- - What kind of game is it?
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:13.500]   - It's a role-playing game.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:18.180]   Circa 1992, '93, '94, Ultima Online,
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:22.940]   first really visual online world in that way.
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:26.100]   But for me, that was a virtual fantasy world
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:28.820]   where you could bake bread, you could pick all this stuff up.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:31.820]   I mean, anyone who's played Ultimas and plays our stuff
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:35.340]   can see the kind of touchstones
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:38.540]   and callbacks to that or inspirations.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:41.700]   And the other thing that I loved about Ultima
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:47.660]   was, they were all different, right?
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:51.140]   That they iterated and there weren't necessarily
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.860]   what I'll call a plus one sequel
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:54.740]   outside of Ultima VII part two,
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:56.660]   clearly a plus one sequel,
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.460]   but they each had their own tone.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:01.380]   I love like the boxes.
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:03.740]   It's something that we get into as well.
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:08.660]   I love this idea that a game also is this tangible thing.
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:10.260]   - Oh, when you buy it--
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.820]   - You buy the cardboard boxes
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:12.940]   and the way they were designed,
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:16.140]   and Ultima VII is black and Ultima VIII is the fiery gate
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:18.220]   and the paintings on them.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:21.300]   - Does that break your heart a little bit
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.700]   that that culture is a bit gone?
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.500]   - A little bit, a little bit.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.740]   And that's also why I like,
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:31.900]   this goes to video gaming or any other digital things
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:34.900]   where digital ownership has great value to people.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:37.900]   So I like looking at my collections of games,
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:41.500]   even digitally, I wanna see nice,
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.940]   in the same way you wanna see nice album art,
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:47.060]   wanna see nice cover art for our games.
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:48.420]   And we spend a lot of time in them
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:50.300]   so that you take a look at Elder Scrolls
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:52.100]   and Mormon Oblivion and Skyrim.
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:55.700]   We want those boxes to look good next to each other.
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.340]   Going back to the video games,
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:01.900]   I always mentioned Tetris because I think it's,
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:05.860]   obviously I love virtual worlds and those kinds of things,
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:10.220]   but for the time and what an interactive like video games
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:11.700]   for the simplest form,
[02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:14.900]   I sort of think you can put Tetris
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:19.900]   in front of just about anybody and they'll enjoy it.
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:27.100]   It's got some moment of challenge and it's just so elegant.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:32.260]   It's like to me, like this very pure game
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:34.300]   that only works 'cause it's a video game.
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:38.260]   - And I think mobile games figured out
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:39.740]   some of the magic of Tetris,
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:43.380]   the simple-- - Some of them have, yeah.
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:46.660]   - But Tetris did it a long, long time ago.
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:49.940]   You can really create that immersive experience without--
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:52.740]   - But for me, the ultimate civilization
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:58.660]   as far as a grand strategy game.
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:03.260]   Pac-Man I mentioned in terms of bringing games
[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.820]   into the mainstream in a way that captured people
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:09.140]   that nothing before it had.
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:10.620]   Super Mario, Donkey Kong, everything.
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:13.780]   Nintendo, probably the best game makers in the world still.
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:17.820]   They know who they are, they know what they wanna do,
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:20.040]   always in awe of what they create.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.660]   - I gotta ask you about a game I haven't played
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.300]   but people put up there as one of the greats,
[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:30.900]   Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:32.500]   Have you gotten a chance to play?
[02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:35.100]   - A lot of it, yes, yes, it's fantastic, it's fantastic.
[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:36.300]   - What do you think about, I mean,
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:37.620]   it's a very different experience.
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:39.580]   I've played other Zeldas than the open worlds
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:42.380]   you've created but it is also an open world.
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:45.420]   - It is, it's my favorite Zelda
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:47.380]   'cause I obviously like open world stuff.
[02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:52.280]   And the one thing that they do really, really well
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.760]   is they don't constrain you.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.820]   Some people, you know, even some of the things we do
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.020]   constrain you a little bit more.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:58.960]   Zelda says, here's the whole thing.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.460]   And you are constrained by the actual
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:07.860]   player abilities you haven't earned yet,
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:11.220]   not some arbitrary barriers.
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:13.580]   And so I think they just did a phenomenal job.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:15.140]   It's a magical game.
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.620]   - It really feels open.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.140]   - It's 'cause it truly is, yes.
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:21.980]   - What about, I mean, I just like asking
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:24.180]   about some open world.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:28.140]   A very different one is the world of either
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:30.900]   Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption.
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:32.100]   - Both love.
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:35.700]   I would put GTA 3, Grand Theft Auto 3 up there
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:38.620]   with the landmark kind of usher in the open world.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:41.620]   When that comes out on the PlayStation 2,
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.260]   even though there was GTA 1 and 2,
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:46.140]   this was an all new thing with the mobster storytelling.
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:49.540]   - Is that the first 3D version, I guess?
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:51.940]   - It was, then Vice City's kind of a fast follow,
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:55.720]   which could be my favorite one.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:58.420]   I loved all the Grand Theft Autos.
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.900]   I think they're really phenomenally well-made games.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.260]   Same with Red Dead.
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:08.260]   I think Red Dead Redemption 1 could be my favorite story.
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:14.100]   Highly recommend finishing that game.
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:15.380]   - So you like both the story.
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:16.820]   You like the grittiness of that,
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:18.480]   'cause they have a bit of the,
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:22.560]   I guess if you like the fallout, there's the humor.
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.260]   I don't know what it is.
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:27.340]   It's the lighthearted humor of it,
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:31.740]   but also the brutality of human nature's in there too.
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:35.380]   But it's like, and also some of the fun
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.860]   they create with the music when you drive
[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:37.700]   and stuff like that.
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:39.540]   They create a world.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:40.380]   There's a tone.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:41.220]   There's a very strong tone.
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:43.500]   - There is a very strong tone.
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:48.500]   The satire on the world is just so well done.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:49.840]   The gameplay is great.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.620]   I think they've just done a phenomenal job.
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:57.340]   - And yeah, there's that Pop to Mind.
[02:14:57.340 --> 02:14:58.500]   - Portal.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:14:59.640]   - Portal, yeah.
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:04.500]   That's another weird creation.
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:06.260]   - I could just sit here and list games forever.
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:08.060]   - For a while, I'm enjoying this.
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:10.220]   - Hearthstone's a game I love.
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:11.460]   I love all type, like sports.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:14.180]   College football, NCAA football was my favorite.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:15.700]   It's like, I would say this is a great role-playing game.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:17.620]   - Oh, you would actually keep getting role-playing?
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:18.500]   - It's a role-playing game,
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:19.940]   'cause I have all these characters.
[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:24.060]   I have like 60 characters, and they're all leveling up,
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:25.100]   and then I have to play them.
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:26.980]   And then the college ones, I like college football.
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:28.540]   They graduate, so you lose your players,
[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:30.660]   and then they stop making the series.
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:32.380]   You know the folks at EA, and they will say,
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:33.220]   "I have bugged them.
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:34.060]   "When is this coming?"
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:35.740]   And they're doing it, so it's finally coming back.
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:36.660]   - Nice.
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:40.900]   What would you say is the greatest sports game of all time?
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:45.620]   - Well, it's NCAA football.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:46.820]   I have to pick the year.
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:50.020]   - NCAA versus Madden?
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:51.020]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:52.620]   Yeah, but there's more teams.
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:55.660]   You get the college fight songs.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:58.900]   There's more pageantry, and the players turn over.
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:00.580]   They're only there for four seasons,
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:01.420]   so you have to,
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:05.980]   so it's more dynamic.
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.420]   - So you like variety versus--
[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:08.780]   - So what was the last one?
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:10.540]   2014, maybe it was.
[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:15.060]   - And you don't like FIFA?
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:18.060]   - I like, look, FIFA's incredible.
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:19.940]   Look, I'm a college football fan.
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:21.020]   They give you that fantasy.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:25.180]   If you like European football/soccer, FIFA's incredible.
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.300]   Yeah, I love that game, too.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.540]   - Have you been paying attention
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:32.300]   to the game design of that world, of those worlds?
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:33.740]   - Yeah, and the thing people, I think,
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:37.860]   with those kind of games, it is really,
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:39.500]   or racing games, Forza, put up there.
[02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:40.460]   I love Forza.
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:42.260]   Play them all.
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.980]   When you have to recreate something that's real
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:47.220]   in the real world, say it's cars or it's sports games,
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:48.980]   everybody knows how it should work.
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:52.500]   That's a really difficult task
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:54.580]   when people know how it should work.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:56.500]   Then you're gonna balance it for single player.
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:00.500]   The multiplayer parts of it, they're very, very competitive.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:03.180]   In many respects, you're forced
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:04.980]   to put out a new version every year.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:09.020]   I say forced in quotes 'cause they're,
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:10.860]   you count them as big updates.
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:14.860]   But it's a much more difficult development process
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:19.460]   than I think people understand
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:21.060]   and how hard those teams work.
[02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:22.460]   I know a lot of people who do it,
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:25.060]   and I think they just do.
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:25.980]   I've enjoyed them all.
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:27.220]   I buy Madden every year.
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:30.220]   - Yeah, every single year.
[02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:31.180]   Yeah, they do refresh it.
[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:32.540]   There's a feeling of freshness.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:33.380]   I don't know what that is.
[02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:34.380]   - Yeah, look, there have been years
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:36.820]   where it feels like less was done and more was done,
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.780]   but I enjoy it every year.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:40.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:43.460]   What does a perfectly productive day
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:45.500]   in the life of Todd Howard look like?
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:49.100]   Maybe not perfectly,
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:51.860]   but just like a perfectly average productive day.
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:55.980]   Are you a morning person, evening person?
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:57.060]   Is it chaos?
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:00.660]   Is it pretty regular schedule?
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.340]   - I'm in a good flow right now.
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.940]   I'm still doing a lot of stuff.
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:06.940]   So there's things I'm executive producing
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:09.980]   and then Starfield I'm directing.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:13.180]   So I sort of view that as that's an everyday thing.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:14.700]   Fortunately, I get to do a lot of stuff
[02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:18.860]   from look at the TV show we're making
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:21.420]   and this Indiana Jones game
[02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:23.060]   that's being developed at Machine Game.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.340]   So we get to look at that.
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:30.220]   But the best really day or where I feel it's fulfilling
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:35.220]   is get to play some of a game,
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:36.420]   the game we'll say Starfield,
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:37.820]   get to play some of Starfield,
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:42.460]   look at the problem set of what it is doing
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:46.340]   and then get in a room with the other developers
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:47.340]   that I work closely with
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:50.020]   and we solve that problem together.
[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:53.420]   So that's the most rewarding thing
[02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:55.580]   when you can say, okay, what do we want this to do?
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:58.700]   What's the real player experience we want?
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.540]   What are all the pieces in front of us?
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.820]   Where you know the actual tangible pieces
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:04.420]   as opposed to the beginning,
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:08.220]   the pie in the sky part is always fun.
[02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:10.860]   But it's like anything is possible, that's fun,
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:14.060]   but it's not rewarding in the same way
[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:15.420]   'cause you haven't solved something.
[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:18.820]   Whereas these are the elements you have to play with.
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:20.700]   How do we make this all work together?
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:22.260]   And you come out of it at the end of the day
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:24.580]   like now that feels great.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:30.100]   - So brainstorming about specific big picture,
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:34.060]   both big picture and very specific detail
[02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:35.260]   of a game that's not working,
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:36.100]   something's not working,
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:38.220]   you wanna fix it, that kind of stuff.
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:39.380]   - 'Cause you feel like, okay,
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:41.020]   you've made tangible progress
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:42.980]   on the actual build of the game.
[02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:44.820]   Where something you played in the beginning of the day
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:48.260]   didn't feel great, you've figured out a solution
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:51.500]   with a group of people, it's always with a group.
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.860]   And then the next day you're like, yeah,
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:55.180]   that worked out.
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:56.180]   - Who's on the team?
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:58.580]   Is it designers, engineers?
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:19:59.420]   - All of the above.
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:01.700]   - Artists, voice, over folks?
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:03.940]   - So internal to the studio,
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:06.380]   it's a lot of programming, a lot of art,
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.620]   you have design, which breaks into some quest design,
[02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:11.300]   writing, systems design,
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:14.020]   who are doing all the treasure and the loot
[02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:15.900]   and the skill systems.
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:18.980]   And then level design is making the spaces like those
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:20.420]   that you'll play through.
[02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:21.900]   Production is a big part of it,
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:23.900]   the producers who organize everything.
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:27.140]   Can't remember if I mentioned art, a lot of artists.
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:30.660]   QA staff as well, they're hugely valuable in saying,
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:32.700]   hey, we broke your game in these magical ways,
[02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:34.620]   what are you gonna do about it?
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:36.700]   - Is the loot design team still hiring?
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:38.180]   How do I apply?
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:40.100]   That seems like the most fun job.
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:40.940]   - Always.
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.300]   - I mean, all of this seems like a super fun job.
[02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:44.180]   - You know what, it's the best.
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:49.180]   Then you have audio and it by far is the greatest job
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:51.980]   you could possibly have.
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:54.900]   Even if you're into technology, it's great.
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:56.940]   If you're into storytelling and creativity and art,
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:57.780]   it's great.
[02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:01.900]   And it's really the gaming, the combination of that.
[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:03.580]   - And like I mentioned to you offline,
[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:06.100]   I think of video games, to me,
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:09.500]   it's brought thousands of hours of happiness.
[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:11.340]   And so when you're designing the game,
[02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:12.420]   whatever you're doing,
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:15.500]   you have a part to play in a thing that's going to bring
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:21.220]   like millions, hundreds of millions of hours
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:23.260]   of happiness to people.
[02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:24.460]   It's crazy, right?
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:28.780]   - It is, and I'm gonna play you saying that back to our team
[02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:30.660]   'cause people forget, your head's down,
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:32.100]   you're trying to solve these problems,
[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:37.100]   and then you do forget how many people it touches.
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.260]   - Like even tiny decisions.
[02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:41.620]   You make tiny little things, you create.
[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:42.460]   - Yeah, it's weird.
[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.100]   I wish there was a way to like,
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:47.540]   I would notice things in a video game,
[02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:48.740]   and it's like, huh, okay.
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:52.780]   It feels good, but you don't get that signal.
[02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:55.340]   The creator doesn't get that signal.
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.020]   I wish they did.
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:59.020]   I guess you could get that signal by,
[02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:02.020]   why is Lux stuck in this room,
[02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:04.820]   like digging through the loot?
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:06.940]   - We do now get a lot of good data
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:08.340]   on what the players are doing.
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:09.540]   - Enjoying and not that kind of--
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:11.980]   - Well, we know where they've been and where they've died
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:13.860]   and how long they play in certain sections,
[02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:16.660]   and we can sort of tell, outside of people just telling us
[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:19.460]   on forums or calling or other things,
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:23.100]   we can tell for some data where people are dropping off
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:27.340]   or having a, we can tell if there's a key frustration point.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:33.140]   - Do you ever think about making people feel
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:36.100]   like human feelings when they play?
[02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:41.100]   Like designing, like make them feel fear or excitement,
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:45.340]   anger, longing, loneliness, stuff.
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:47.300]   - All of the above, yeah, of course.
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:50.860]   The big one I like to say is the video games give you
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:54.420]   is pride outside of other, you know,
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:56.860]   if you watch movies or things like that,
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.560]   like, yeah, but you never think like, look what I did.
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:04.100]   And that feeling of like accomplishment and pride
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:07.420]   in what you did or you overcame,
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:09.100]   you talked about going back to a game that,
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:13.780]   like, those are real feelings of like accomplishment
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:18.780]   that I've felt in games that I've played.
[02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:23.780]   And when we get to see a player feel that,
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:26.860]   it's really, really special.
[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:30.060]   The other one is there is a, you know,
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:33.520]   there is an escape or to be someone else
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:36.760]   that's more powerful in our games
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:38.720]   that you aren't in real life
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:41.420]   that gives you a confidence or a perspective.
[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:45.420]   We're doing one next week,
[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:47.340]   we've done a number of make a wish visits,
[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:50.420]   kids who could wish for anything,
[02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:53.700]   and they wanna come and I wanna see the next game
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:55.820]   and meet the creators and see how you do it.
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:58.100]   And they come with their family.
[02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:02.820]   And it is like the greatest thing that we do.
[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:07.080]   And it reminds you of like how important it is.
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.360]   And the other really awesome thing is
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:13.600]   that you can see like the family change
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:14.540]   by the end of the day.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:17.660]   Like they don't, they didn't even realize what it meant
[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:19.960]   to their child or what went into it.
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:23.880]   And it's just, that to me is like,
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:26.880]   been involved with that foundation for a number of years.
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.900]   And it's been really good, you know,
[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:33.300]   reminder of how lucky we are.
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:35.260]   - And in general for young people,
[02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:37.740]   that sense of accomplishment is hard to find.
[02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:40.440]   - Yeah, where they don't,
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:45.440]   not everybody has it in the outlets that real life provides.
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:47.980]   - Well, that's the thing.
[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:51.320]   I mean, the world is cruel to when you're young.
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:53.860]   Nobody takes you seriously.
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.180]   You don't get like,
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:57.700]   that's why you, everybody always wants to grow up
[02:24:57.700 --> 02:24:59.340]   and get old as quickly as possible.
[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:02.300]   It's the hardest, it's hard.
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:04.780]   - And then video games allow you,
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:06.780]   I mean, to build that sense of confidence,
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.500]   a sense of pride in something.
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:11.220]   That's why when people talk down to video games,
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:12.660]   like it's a culture and so on,
[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:15.620]   it's not, it misses out
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:18.220]   on that really deeply meaningful thing.
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:20.340]   Especially with like single player,
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.300]   there's some darker aspects to multiplayer
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:24.140]   that people create communities and, you know,
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:26.420]   it can go off the rails a bit,
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:28.520]   but the actual experience of the game,
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:32.520]   especially one where you stick with for a while,
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:33.740]   that's really beautiful.
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:38.820]   Do you have advice for those same young folks?
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:43.440]   Given that your life is an interesting one,
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.100]   given what kind of degree you got
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:47.840]   and being a legendary game designer,
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.960]   do you have advice for young folks in high school,
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.920]   maybe college, how to have a career or a life
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.040]   they can be proud of?
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:00.280]   - Well, you have to find something that you love so much
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:04.120]   that it's never gonna feel like a job.
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:07.200]   And don't do it for money,
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:08.680]   don't do it for, find something you love
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.520]   and the rest of it will come.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:15.760]   It won't be a straight path.
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:21.640]   And do not ever underestimate yourself.
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:25.240]   It's gonna take hard work,
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:28.360]   but the worst thing that young people do
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:30.240]   is think they can't accomplish something
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:32.920]   or they underestimate themselves.
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.400]   And maybe those first few times through
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.360]   where they do fail, if they love it enough,
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:43.120]   they're gonna be resilient and push past that.
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.040]   Anyone who's had success or gotten somewhere,
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.520]   they've had those times, right?
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:54.080]   And they've stayed resilient because they love it so much
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:56.720]   that this is what they wanna do.
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.200]   When you do it for other reasons,
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.440]   just don't think it's gonna work out the same.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:06.280]   - Did you have low points in your life,
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.040]   dark points where your mind went to a dark place,
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.520]   whether it's struggling to get a job,
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.960]   but that's the soft works,
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:19.960]   or maybe with a red guard flop
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.800]   where you kind of started to doubt yourself
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:24.640]   or any of that?
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:27.000]   - Well, I think what's weird looking back,
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.760]   I was always so in love with doing this
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:37.760]   that I didn't view them as dark per se.
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.520]   Looking back, I was like, oh, that was,
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:45.800]   I just wanted to, okay, let me find a way to make this work.
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.400]   - Even when it's hard and it's failing
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:49.320]   and all that kind of stuff, you just kind of like,
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:51.440]   it's a problem before you to solve.
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:54.160]   - Yeah, when I started at Bethesda,
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:57.880]   I don't know, my father had moved nearby to the office.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:01.800]   I was moving and I slept on a sofa.
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:03.120]   I didn't care.
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:03.960]   I don't need a bedroom.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.280]   I'll sleep on the sofa and work there.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:07.280]   It's all I wanna do.
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.480]   When the company almost went out of business,
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:12.080]   it was, well, I hope it doesn't.
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:15.360]   I feel somewhat responsible,
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.600]   but hey, let's, okay, that's a learning lesson.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:20.440]   Let's go.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:23.240]   I think I was pretty resilient to it all.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.160]   Fallout 76, really bad launch.
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:29.400]   And okay, what did we do wrong?
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:30.240]   What can we learn?
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:31.080]   Let's go at it.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:33.120]   Now it's a success.
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.640]   But those kind of ups and downs
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:38.280]   for the length of developments that we have,
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.160]   people don't see them, but we have them all the time.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:46.800]   And so it's that sort of belief that with the team
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:49.040]   having done it time and time again,
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.520]   to know that now we're gonna make it
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.760]   as good as we possibly can.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:56.080]   And whatever we're experiencing now,
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:57.560]   when we solve it and we get it out,
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:00.640]   and we see the millions of people who love it,
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:01.520]   it's all worth it.
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:05.120]   - And you're getting into new spaces.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.840]   First of all, new worlds with Starfield,
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:09.960]   but also new, I saw the TV show you're working on.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.920]   On Fallout with Amazon.
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:16.880]   What's that like?
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:20.520]   Worlds that you created in the digital realm
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:23.120]   becoming, going on the screen.
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:26.160]   - Yeah, people asked, I can remember 10 years ago
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:28.120]   after Fallout 3 was a hit,
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:29.640]   movie producers coming and,
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:32.200]   "Hey, we think this would make a great movie."
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:33.640]   And taking a lot of meetings.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:35.960]   And I think most people would jump at that.
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:37.240]   Like, sweet.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:41.960]   And I sort of paused and like, I don't know.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:44.280]   What is this gonna do?
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:45.640]   I feel like they're gonna synthesize.
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:48.160]   I met great people, like well-known creatives.
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.960]   Like, it's gonna get synthesized into this two hour,
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:51.800]   I don't know.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:56.120]   I'm not seeing the great thing here yet.
[02:29:56.120 --> 02:30:01.120]   So, I think the advent of television
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:04.640]   in terms of what it's become nowadays
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:06.400]   with big budget TV series,
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:08.400]   it kind of came up again and met with people.
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:11.480]   And Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy who do Westworld.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:16.400]   And I always love the work he did
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:17.920]   writing Interstellar and the Dark,
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:18.760]   like movies I just love.
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:20.720]   - Wait, Jonathan Nolan's involved with this?
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:23.160]   - Yeah, he's the EP.
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.000]   - That's epic.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:24.840]   - And he's directed the first--
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:25.680]   - Westworld's incredible.
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.520]   - Yeah. - Okay, this is awesome.
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:32.520]   - And he's the EP, he's directed the first few episodes.
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:37.720]   And when I connected with him, Jonah,
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:42.160]   he was like, "Hey, you're the person I want to do this."
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:44.160]   So, I met with people, kept saying like,
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.400]   just let me see if he wants to do it.
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:49.320]   And to my joy, he was like,
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:51.360]   "Oh yeah, Fall 3 is one of my, yeah, sign me up."
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:53.920]   It was like, "No, how do we get this done?"
[02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:56.400]   And at that time, he was at HBO
[02:30:56.400 --> 02:30:59.480]   and we were trying to figure out,
[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:01.120]   it was put a little pause on it.
[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:07.120]   And got to visit the sets, reading scripts
[02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:09.920]   and things like that, it's all new to me.
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:13.360]   But they're doing such an incredible job.
[02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.720]   Like, I think if you like this world,
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.360]   you are gonna be just blown away.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.360]   - Some of the tone. - I've never made
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.560]   a TV show. - Right.
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:22.960]   - Those are all the best, no one ever does it
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:24.880]   wanting it to not be great,
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.600]   but they've just done their attention to detail
[02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:32.440]   and just obsessive with what's on the screen
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:36.720]   and the storytelling and how it looks, the whole thing.
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:40.600]   - Yeah, I think obsession is really a prerequisite
[02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:45.360]   for greatness, what they did, HBO did with Chernobyl.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.000]   Like, the attention to detail. - Great series.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.600]   - It's just incredible. - And he's doing
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:51.520]   The Last of Us now, that showrunner.
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:55.360]   - If you really care and you really put a lot of effort
[02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:57.720]   into the details, you can basically truly expect it.
[02:31:57.720 --> 02:31:58.800]   - I was stunned.
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.400]   I mean, I don't wanna spoil it, but when people see it,
[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:05.200]   I think they'll just be like, "Wow."
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:07.680]   The other thing, we were approaching it,
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:09.640]   it's very different where when it was,
[02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:10.800]   people would say they wanna make a movie,
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:13.120]   they wanted to tell the story of Fallout 3
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:15.480]   or then tell the story of Fallout 4.
[02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:18.080]   And for this, it was, hey, let's do something
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:20.680]   that exists in the world of Fallout.
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:22.760]   It's not retelling a game story.
[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:26.120]   It's basically an area of the map
[02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:30.680]   and let's tell a story here that fits in the world
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:34.920]   that we have built, doesn't break any of the rules,
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:37.560]   can reference things in the games,
[02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:39.560]   but isn't a retelling of the games
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.040]   that exists in the same world, but is its own unique thing.
[02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:46.000]   So it adds to it, while also people who don't,
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.360]   haven't played the games, who can't experience
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:52.720]   how crazy cool Fallout is, can watch the series.
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:58.120]   - Are there some similarities or interesting differences
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:00.400]   between the creation of a game and a TV show
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:03.720]   that you notice from the story perspective?
[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:06.720]   - Well, for them, it's much more character-driven.
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:08.520]   You can do all these things with the world
[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:10.120]   and stuff that we already have.
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:13.800]   It's the main characters, who they are,
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:18.800]   what their motivations are, that really is the engine.
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:23.520]   Finding the right actors to do those, yeah.
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:26.360]   - 'Cause there's no interaction.
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:30.120]   You don't get to enter that world.
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:32.000]   They have to do the work for you.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.240]   The NPCs are on the show.
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:35.720]   Yeah, I can't wait to see how it turns out.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:38.240]   You also mentioned Indiana Jones.
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:40.560]   That's a weird, that's a different one.
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.360]   How do you work with a famous protagonist?
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:49.300]   When the character's known, how do you work with that?
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:53.000]   - Well, it's different.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.480]   Indiana Jones is different where the name,
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:00.360]   it is the, it's Indiana Jones, not a world, it's him.
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:01.880]   Right, you can talk about the world of Indiana Jones,
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:05.000]   but at the end of the day, it's about this character.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.600]   And Raiders, still my favorite movie of all time.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.840]   No debate, it's the best movie ever.
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:13.360]   - Best movie ever. - Ever.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:16.740]   - On a tangent, what do you love about it?
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:20.680]   - Well, I saw it, obviously, when I was younger,
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:21.880]   and I believed it.
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:23.360]   I believed this happened.
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.160]   And when they found the Ark, I literally,
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.720]   I could not believe that they found it.
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:31.680]   And I have found over my life,
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:35.880]   it's still really watchable every time.
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.080]   I enjoy it every single time.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:41.560]   Love the character, love the story.
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:45.360]   The opening is the greatest movie opening ever.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:49.600]   And I just love everything, I love everything about it.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:50.560]   - What was the opening?
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:51.640]   Is this when the-- - What?
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:53.400]   It's the temple, and then the ball rolls
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:54.240]   and tries to crush him.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:55.720]   - Oh, that's the opening. - That's the opening
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:58.520]   of Raiders, yeah, he steals the idol.
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:00.840]   - I think you're deeply offended.
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:03.680]   - I was like, what's the opening of Raiders?
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:06.040]   So I've always wanted to, it's one of those things,
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:07.400]   like what's on your bucket list?
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:10.000]   Like, oh, I wanna make an Indiana Jones game.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.320]   And I had pitched Lucas, I met some people there
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:15.800]   and pitched them back in '09,
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.560]   this Indiana Jones game concept.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:23.000]   And they wanted to publish, kind of the deal fell apart.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.760]   They wanted to publish it, and we were a publisher,
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:26.360]   and so we didn't do it.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.720]   And I didn't really have the team to do it,
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:32.520]   I just was gonna figure that out after we agreed to a deal.
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:35.720]   And well, we made Skyrim, so it worked out.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:38.640]   And then, fast forward 10 years plus,
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:41.720]   and Lucas, now part of Disney,
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.640]   and they're doing a lot more of licensing
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:45.600]   and working with people, and so I knew some folks there
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.640]   and said, oh, I have this idea
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:50.840]   that I pitched a long time ago.
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.120]   And they loved it, and again,
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:56.480]   the internal team that I had,
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:57.920]   not only didn't have the time,
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:01.800]   they probably weren't as good a fit as Machine Games,
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:03.440]   who's done the Wolfenstein series,
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:06.240]   who is the perfect fit for this game,
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.080]   with storytelling and how they record it.
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.280]   And they are, it's awesome,
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:14.440]   they're just doing an incredible job with that game.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:17.280]   People are gonna be, if you like Indiana Jones,
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:20.840]   it is a definite love letter to Indiana Jones
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:22.400]   and everything with it.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:27.400]   - Can you say if it's more on the action adventure side,
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:29.400]   like the actual experience of the game?
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.560]   - I could go back, I would just say it is a mashup.
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.920]   It is a unique, it isn't one thing intentionally.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:42.600]   So it does a lot of different things
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.320]   that we've, myself and Jurek
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.120]   and the folks at Machine Games have wanted to do in a game.
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:52.980]   So it's a unique thing.
[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.680]   - Before I forget, who do I,
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.000]   how many humans do I have to kill,
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:00.440]   I mean dragons do I have to kill
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:04.600]   to get myself somehow into Elder Scrolls VI?
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:08.280]   So mod, if anyone wants to create mods of me,
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:09.920]   and is that possible?
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.160]   - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, it's possible.
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.720]   While maintaining realism somehow.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:17.320]   You don't want a person in a suit and tie.
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.280]   Doesn't make sense. - You put you in both,
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:21.960]   put you in Fallout, you can wear that.
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:25.040]   - Yeah, please put me, so Fallout,
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:26.800]   there's also a culture of--
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:30.240]   - You do a mod where you replace the mysterious stranger.
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:32.880]   - There you go.
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:35.800]   That's a to-do task. - Top mod, right there.
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:38.600]   - And you will have my deep gratitude
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:41.440]   and more, dear stranger, for doing so.
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:44.440]   What's the programming language for mods?
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:47.120]   Is it mostly-- - They use our internal
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.280]   scripting language that's built into the tool.
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:53.240]   - Okay, I'm almost afraid to explore that world,
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:55.560]   'cause you will never, never, never turn back.
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.880]   How long, you've created so many incredible games,
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:06.280]   is there, what does the future hold?
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:09.080]   Is there, so going through this process,
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.040]   do you still have the energy, the passion, the drive--
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:13.520]   - I do. - To keep creating?
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:16.800]   - I cannot imagine doing anything else.
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:20.240]   I'd like to do it as long as possible.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:22.520]   I will say, though, as I've done it,
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:27.000]   soon it'll be 30 years at Bethesda,
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.040]   I've learned that to appreciate the developments
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:36.760]   a little bit more, that the time it takes,
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:41.760]   I should prioritize all of us enjoying
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.800]   the development process more than I did in the past.
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:49.320]   It was like, just wanted to, the end,
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:50.520]   that's all that mattered.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.920]   And the more you do it, you realize,
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:55.440]   no, I'm spending the majority of my life
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:58.560]   in Tamriel and the Wasteland and Fallout,
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.040]   so the moments that we're all doing this together,
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:03.320]   we need to enjoy it.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:05.120]   It's a lot of work finishing Starfield,
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.120]   but hey, we gotta enjoy this.
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.240]   This is incredible.
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.520]   We don't get that many shots.
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:14.320]   So the actual process of creating the struggles
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:16.720]   along the way of stuff not working,
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.280]   like you said, at this point,
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.680]   with Starfield probably creating some of the glue
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.200]   of how stuff feels and going back again and again and again
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:25.720]   to try to make the beginning better,
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:26.560]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.680]   - And I would say it for anybody's vocation,
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:31.360]   whatever you're doing, whatever people do,
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:33.960]   you're gonna have harder times.
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:39.280]   And sometimes people, you gotta maybe recalibrate yourself
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:42.080]   to like, okay, how can we make this more enjoyable
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.440]   for all of us, no matter what you're doing, and rewarding.
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:49.680]   - So if life is a video game, which it most likely is,
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.600]   what do you think is the meaning of life?
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:53.720]   From having created so many games,
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.280]   or the character has to try to figure out,
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.520]   I mean, there's bigger questions
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.120]   than just solving the quest.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:04.920]   You're asking the big questions of why am I here?
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:06.200]   I feel like that's good practice
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.080]   for answering the same question for this video game we're in.
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:13.680]   What do you think is the meaning of life, Todd Howard?
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.440]   - That's a very...
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:27.200]   I can say what motivates me.
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.720]   - That's a good start.
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:33.240]   - Having a curiosity.
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:38.920]   The ability to not assume a lot
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.920]   and be curious about the world around you.
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:47.560]   It's more, it's not the same
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:49.480]   as just wanting to learn everything,
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:52.840]   but what makes other humans tick?
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:55.400]   How do they feel, how do they love?
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:58.920]   It might be cliche to say the meaning of life is to love.
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:04.000]   - So that curiosity is just, is about--
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.680]   - Noticing the world.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:08.320]   - Noticing the world around you.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.080]   Look, there's an anecdote someone says,
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.800]   everybody has two lives,
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.960]   and the second one starts when you realize there's only one.
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:21.920]   And I think, I usually preach to my children
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:24.040]   and everything else, like have a curiosity
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:25.440]   to the world around you,
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:28.080]   and you'll have the most fulfilling days.
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:32.680]   - Are you able to be inside the worlds that you've created
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:37.680]   and be able to notice them, like really enjoy them?
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:40.800]   - It takes time, so Skyrim had its 10th anniversary,
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.840]   so when I went back into it,
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.040]   I think I got to see it for what it is.
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:47.680]   My younger son got really into it
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.200]   a few years back on the Switch.
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.520]   That's what we noticed, people age up into it.
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:56.040]   So one of the reasons it's so popular is,
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:57.720]   you know, people come into,
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.200]   they're now becoming teenagers,
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.640]   and oh, okay, I'll finally play Skyrim.
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.280]   And, you know, he got obsessed with it.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.360]   And he wasn't, usually I'd say, hey, check out my games,
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.040]   and he'd be like, ah, shut up, Dad,
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:13.280]   we're playing this other stuff.
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:14.640]   And he got obsessed with Skyrim,
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:18.080]   like we're having deep Elder Scrolls lore conversations
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.920]   at dinner, and I saw it through his eyes,
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:25.000]   and that was pretty special.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.680]   And then the mods he was downloading,
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:29.520]   and the YouTubers he was following, talking about stuff.
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.800]   So the people who like the Elder Scrolls people
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.120]   don't realize how much of that I have watched with my son.
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.280]   And then I kind of, when the 10th anniversary came out,
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:39.320]   like, oh, I'm gonna check out a build,
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:40.520]   I have to check out the build out,
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:42.120]   but I hadn't played it in so long.
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:47.040]   And it was like, it does, it has this flow,
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:49.320]   where like, oh my God, I just played for four hours.
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:51.400]   I need to turn it off.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:56.160]   - Yeah, I mean, there's something about enjoying
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:57.760]   video games with the people you love, too,
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:02.160]   or the water cooler discussion, and with kids.
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:04.240]   So I actually, I would love to have kids,
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:06.720]   and hopefully soon in the future.
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:09.480]   So I guess the thing I need your advice on
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:12.120]   is how do I time it in such a way
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:14.280]   when they're old enough,
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:16.880]   right at the age they're old enough,
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:18.680]   like, I wanna know when to have them
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:21.200]   so that when they're old enough,
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.240]   that's exactly when Elder Scrolls VI comes out.
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:26.960]   So I wanna, can you give me a hint when I should have kids?
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:27.800]   All right, nevermind.
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:30.840]   - You are a genius at how to ask that question.
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:32.840]   - The number of times.
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:33.920]   Yeah, you told the anecdote
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:36.240]   that your son asked you the same question.
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.600]   But of course, it's all for good fun.
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:42.120]   Take as much time as is needed.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:43.760]   Skyrim is still an incredible game,
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:46.520]   and it has an impact on millions of people,
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:48.240]   as do all of your games.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:51.480]   Thank you for everything you've done for the world.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:52.320]   - Thank you.
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.760]   - It's a huge honor that you would talk with me.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.920]   - This has been an honor.
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.840]   And it has to be said,
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:00.320]   look, I have a huge team of people I've worked with
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:03.520]   for some of them for 20 years,
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.520]   and it's really all of us together.
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:10.480]   - Keep doing a great job.
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:13.240]   Guys and gals, I can't wait to see what you create next.
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:15.520]   It really, really does have an impact
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:17.440]   on silly kids like me,
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:19.440]   and millions of silly kids like me.
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:21.160]   So I really appreciate everything.
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:22.000]   - Thank you.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.400]   - Thanks, Todd.

[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:36.120]   So come snow after fire,
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:38.520]   and even dragons have their end.
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:40.520]   Thank you for listening,
