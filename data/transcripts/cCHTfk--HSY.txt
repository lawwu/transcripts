[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   I'd like to ask you about another area
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   where you really have seemed to see around corners.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.440]   And this is one that actually carried
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.560]   with it significant risk.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.440]   Not necessarily risk to health and to life,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   but risk in terms of outside perceptions.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.840]   And that's psychedelics.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.360]   As you know, I've substantially changed my view on this.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.560]   We don't need to go into my former stance on it.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   And I talked about that when you were gracious enough
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.600]   to host me on your podcast for a second time,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.560]   done some psychedelics recreationally as a kid.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.360]   It was correlated with not so great times in my life,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.000]   stayed away from them, then eventually revisited MDMA
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.040]   in particular from a therapeutic standpoint,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.200]   found tremendous benefit.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.920]   Again, therapeutically with a medical doctor.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   Again, these drugs are illegal,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.360]   soon to change perhaps, hopefully.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.680]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   But it's becoming clear from the controlled studies
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.160]   by Robin Carter Harris.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.440]   There are many others, Nolan Williams, others,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.080]   that these drugs have enormous potential
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.860]   to help relieve depression, trauma,
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.680]   help people explore their psyche, their mind,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.320]   for sake of feeling better, doing better in the world,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.520]   for leaning into life, not tune in, drop out,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.760]   but to really lean into life with more purpose
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.960]   and more satisfaction.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500]   In some cases, they've really have saved lives, I think.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880]   What was your mindset around psychedelics
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480]   when you first started exploring them?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.480]   What led you to overcome the inevitable fear gap there?
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.780]   Because you do seem like somebody
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.280]   who takes value in your health, right?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.680]   You're not reckless.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.760]   You may have been more adventurous in the past
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.400]   with things like, I hate the word,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   but biohacking and self-experimentation than you are now,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.280]   but you obviously have some self-preservation mechanism
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.760]   intact. - We learn, we learn.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.920]   - We learn.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.160]   What was your mindset around it at the time?
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.740]   And then I want to get to what you've learned from it.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.360]   And frankly, the tremendous efforts that you've put
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.760]   that are now translating to tremendous value
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.600]   for really millions of people.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   And ultimately, I think it's going to be billions of people
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.360]   by establishing funding for the pioneering research
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.560]   in this area, helping to promote the movement
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.080]   of these compounds from illegal to legal
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.000]   in the therapeutic setting, so on and so on.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So take us back to your first thoughtful exploration
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200]   of psychedelics.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   What'd that look like?
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.400]   You're like, oh, mushrooms, I'll eat them.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Was that it or was it a dedicated research process?
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.920]   And who'd you talk to?
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.380]   What was it all about?
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.200]   - So let's go way back to my undergrad experience.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.120]   And there were many reasons that I ended up
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.240]   going to Princeton.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.600]   I think I was very lucky to get in.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   My SAT scores, because I could never finish the damn test.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.560]   I was so much of a perfectionist.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.520]   I'd get stuck and ended up not doing terribly well,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.640]   but through essays and other things,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.740]   ultimately was able to go.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.000]   Part of the draw for me-- - Well, let me interrupt you
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.400]   and just say, I think at this point we can say
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   they were lucky to have you.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.000]   - Well, thank you for saying that.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   Thank you for saying that.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.760]   - Great institution.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.600]   And you've done great.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.760]   And you're a great poster on the wall for them.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.520]   - Oh, really? - I hope so.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.480]   - Really, really.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.760]   Yeah, I just want to say it, 'cause you're not going to.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.080]   And I think it's important that these are great institutions
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.360]   that great minds go through there.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   And Einstein went through there.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.240]   And their success rests not just on the Einsteins,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.880]   but also on the student body
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.320]   and what they go out into the world and do,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.120]   and not just in the realm of science.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360]   So really, they're lucky to have had you.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.920]   - Yeah, thank you, Andrew.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.320]   I studied Chinese in a room where Einstein used to teach.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.480]   It's pretty cool to set foot and spend time weekly
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600]   in a space that was shared by some of these people.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.440]   - Amazing.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.840]   - It really gets the imagination firing.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.160]   If we go back to that chapter in my life,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.760]   I was initially a psychology major
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.240]   with a focus on neuroscience.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   So I wanted to be a neuroscientist.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.760]   And there are many reasons for that.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   I have neurodegenerative disease on both sides of my family,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.960]   so Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.320]   So that was certainly a personal driving interest
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.840]   in terms of looking at mechanisms,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.200]   understanding what therapeutics existed or did not exist,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.680]   how things were developing in the research.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.600]   And while I was there,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.640]   which later I ended up switching gears and transferring
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.400]   to focus on language acquisition and East Asian studies,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   hence the Chinese that I mentioned earlier
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   and Japanese and Korean.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240]   But on the neuroscience side,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.920]   there were a lot of cool breakthroughs also
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   that came out of Princeton around that time,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.680]   looking at the amazing discovery of, say, neuronal,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.520]   I don't wanna say regenesis,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640]   but neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.480]   - Yeah, Ms. Gould's work.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.040]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   So there was quite a bit happening at that time.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.280]   I was a subject.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.080]   I loved volunteering for studies
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   just to try to get an inside look
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400]   at how things were done
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.360]   in some of Daniel Kahneman's experiments.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.760]   So it was a cool time to be there.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   And within the first two years, I wanna say,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   I had my first experience recreationally with mushrooms.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.200]   And looking back now,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.640]   I'm horrified by the lack of control,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.280]   and meaning not control, but lack of supervision, right?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.600]   I mean, the setting, the set and setting ended up being fine.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.640]   Nothing terrible happened,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.120]   but there were a lot of ways it could have gone sideways.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.000]   But that first experience,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.720]   and I must have consumed in retrospect
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.320]   just a dizzying amount of mushrooms.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.120]   - This would be in excess of five grams.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.400]   - It would have been more, yeah.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.440]   Just knowing what I know now,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.920]   it would have been pretty--
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.600]   - Kids don't do this at all.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.640]   - Don't do that.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.040]   - I'm not gonna say don't do it at home.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880]   Don't do it at all.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.160]   - Please, I actually don't think
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.120]   the young developing brain
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960]   should be exposed to psychedelics.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.800]   - We can talk about that.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.640]   - We can talk about that.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.480]   - Yeah, we can talk about that.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.320]   - I'm gonna take my stance.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.840]   I'm gonna take my stance for now.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.160]   - Yeah, I mean, in the world in which we live,
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.240]   in the US, I would totally agree with you.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.280]   There are some interesting cultural exceptions
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.960]   in other places where things are more set up
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.160]   to provide for that type of use,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   but I certainly would not recommend it.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.720]   But coming back to my recreational experience,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.960]   my subjective experience was so bizarre,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.760]   and my experience of time so nonlinear,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   my experience of self so different
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.160]   from anything I had experienced up to that point,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.680]   and therefore my construction of reality
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.440]   being so completely unlike anything I had experienced
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.680]   was enough to make me want to learn about these compounds.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   And very early on, I still have a scan of it somewhere.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   I think it was in 1998 or '99, I actually wrote a paper.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.120]   One of my junior papers was focused
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.760]   on examining potential similarities
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   between REM sleep and LSD, LSD-25,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.080]   and looking at some of the patterns of neural activity.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.280]   Of course, we can do a lot more now
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.480]   with the tools that we have available,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.640]   but from a scientific perspective,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.240]   I was very curious about how much we knew
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600]   and how much we didn't know.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   And I would say that latter category
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.360]   gets me more excited in a way.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   And I'm like, okay, how much room is there for growth here?
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.960]   Because if we're just putting on the finishing touches
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.360]   with marginal, incremental improvements
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.400]   on something that we feel like we've largely figured out,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.760]   that's less interesting to me
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.400]   than something that baffles most people
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.520]   examining them on some level.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.400]   And there was a professor named Barry Jacobs
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.880]   who was doing some very interesting work.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.400]   He did a lot of work looking at the serotonergic systems
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.040]   and did a lot of work with cats.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.200]   Ultimately, I could not do personally
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.440]   the animal work required of the sort of indentured servitude
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.280]   that I would take home.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.840]   - I think you wrote someplace once,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.160]   you said when confronted with the prospect
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.040]   of installing a computer printer
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.320]   into the head of a cat. - A printer jack.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.480]   - A printer jack. - On the back of a cat head.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.600]   - On the back of a cat head.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   - They literally had those little VGA ports
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.560]   on the back of these cats' heads,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.640]   because cats sleep a lot
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.280]   and so they're interesting to study.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   - Very few laboratories work on cats any longer.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.920]   It's mostly a mouse, still some non-human primate work.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.320]   My laboratory is essentially shut down
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.680]   or is in the process of shutting down even our mouse work.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.840]   I much prefer to work on humans.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.520]   They can give consent and they house themselves.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.000]   The animal research thing is tough.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.600]   For any sentient being, it's tough.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360]   - For what it's worth, the cats seem pretty happy.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   They were just sleeping.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.760]   I mean, the ports were for tracking.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.440]   So the cats were pretty, I mean, they were just normal cats.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.360]   The cats were fine, but I would have been,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.600]   we would have been injecting retroviruses into rats
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   and then perfusing them, which means bleeding them to death
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.360]   to avoid bruising of the tissue,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.120]   because then if you're gonna take thin slices and scans,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.800]   you didn't want to have bruising.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   And I just couldn't do it.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.200]   I think it's important.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.320]   I do think, I do think there's a place for it,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   but I couldn't do it.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.320]   So that's why I transferred out.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.880]   But the point I was trying to make
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.320]   is that I had the experience
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.720]   and then I had that drive, the scientific interest.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.760]   And then I had probably one experience per year
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.680]   for a few years after that.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.240]   And what I noticed for myself personally,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.440]   because I suffered from major depressive disorder
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.280]   and extended depressive episodes,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.160]   let's just say on average three to four a year.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.600]   And by extended-
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.920]   - Even before you had started all of this.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.960]   - Oh, even before, yeah.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   - From a young age.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.640]   - Yeah, from a very young age.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.880]   And I would say, so let's just call it three to four
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.160]   on average a year.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   Those could last each a few weeks or a few months.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.040]   I mean, this is a very high percentage of my total year.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.720]   And when I had these higher dose experiences with mushrooms,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.400]   so we're talking about psilocybin mushrooms.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.960]   And then if we're looking at the molecule
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   that's being examined scientifically, psilocybin,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.040]   I noticed this afterglow effect that was really durable.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.960]   And that was an antidepressant effect
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.600]   or a mood elevating effect
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.120]   that lasted far longer than the half-life could explain.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.640]   Four to six hours, you're kind of on the other side.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.520]   And I would experience this afterglow effect
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.400]   for three to six months.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.080]   And that raised all sorts of interesting questions.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.720]   What the hell is going on here?
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   Is it the content?
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.440]   Is it some structural change?
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.640]   There were a lot of unanswered questions for me.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.440]   And then I had a very, very scary experience
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.600]   that led me to completely stop use of psychedelics
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.440]   where, again, uncontrolled environment,
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.000]   ended up in rural New York,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.040]   coming out of my trip, standing in the middle of the road
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.920]   in the middle of the night with headlights coming at me.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   - Goodness gracious.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.080]   - So you don't wanna do that.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.760]   And I was like, okay, too dangerous.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.880]   - Were you taking them alone?
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.720]   Is that how that is?
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.760]   - I was taking them with two friends
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.680]   and my two friends, without telling me,
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.200]   just went for a walk and left me alone.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.040]   So don't do that.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.920]   - It points to the, I mean, these are powerful compounds.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.760]   - Yeah, you're playing with nuclear power.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.920]   Like these are the, this is the nuclear power
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   of psychological or psycho-emotional surgery
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.040]   is the way I encourage people to think about them.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.440]   And I stopped using any psychedelics completely.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.800]   I was still very interested in them,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.040]   but I basically hit pause.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.800]   And I didn't revisit that until, let's call it 2012, 2013,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.920]   where I was still struggling
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.040]   with major depressive disorder.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.160]   And I saw my girlfriend at the time completely transformed
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.280]   by supervised facilitated use of, in this case,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   ayahuasca, which was not quite as common
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.600]   as it is in conversation at the time.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.400]   And she did that in South America,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   but she not only explained her experience,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.280]   but I was able to see the transformation in her
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.080]   that seemed to have some durability over time.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.440]   And that is when I started stepping back
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.240]   into researching psychedelics,
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   looking at what had been published in the last,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.920]   let's just call it 10 years as of that point in time.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   And thinking about how I would approach it systematically
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.280]   with safeguards, with proper supervision,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.240]   and basically approaching it the way I would have approached
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.640]   any of the topics in the 4-Hour Body.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.160]   And that is what led me back into,
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.760]   along with a number of other interventions, I should say,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.160]   so I wasn't betting the farm on psychedelics.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.760]   I also started TM at that point.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   I was--
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440]   - Excuse yourself.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.280]   Some people might, Transcendental Meditation.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   These are like four to 10 day meditation retreats.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.160]   - This was actually much shorter.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.960]   It was a two or three day training.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   And you're visiting the instructor,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.840]   I wanna say it's once or twice a day,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   probably once a day,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.520]   and getting up to speed.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.480]   And I did this because I was going through
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   a period of acute stress.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   This was finishing the 4-Hour Chef.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.080]   This was actually probably in the years preceding that.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.880]   And I had one friend who I'd seen really change
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.840]   from let's just call hyperkinetic high anxiety
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.320]   to low anxiety.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.920]   And he said, "You have the time, you have the money,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.360]   "pay for the course, just take it."
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.600]   Yes, there are all these criticisms of TM.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.000]   Yes, there are all these weird historical anecdotes
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.200]   of people trying to levitate and all this weirdness.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Just ignore that.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.920]   - Trying to levitate, nothing against that.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.360]   If you actually levitate, then we gotta have a discussion.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.640]   But trying to levitate seems like it.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.480]   - Why not?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.520]   - Every kid tries all sorts of things.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.360]   - Give it a go.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.440]   He's like, "Just put that aside."
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.120]   Because I kept coming up with pushback.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.520]   And he's like, "Look, all I'm saying is
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.840]   "it's like a warm bath for your mind
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.680]   "that you take twice a day
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.880]   "and it'll chill you the fuck out.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.760]   "So try it."
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.600]   And I was like, "Okay, fine."
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   - That's a good endorsement.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.800]   - I was like, at this point,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.720]   I had been burning the candle at both ends so intensely.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.680]   It's like, "Okay."
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.880]   So there was TM, and then I began examining
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   how I might approach.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.840]   Notice I didn't just jump into using them.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.800]   I was like, "How could I approach taking psychedelics
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   "in a logical sequence with proper protections,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.440]   "with safety assurances?"
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.560]   And that took me probably a month or two.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.000]   And I was right in the middle of things.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.560]   Northern California, you have access to a lot.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.800]   And only then did I start looking at
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   having my own experiences.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.400]   And lo and behold, I mean, I'll cut to the chase,
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   but the personal outcome,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.960]   and there are many different benefits and risks
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.480]   I should make very clear.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.520]   These things can be extremely dangerous in certain ways.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.480]   Generally, not physiologically, but they can be dangerous.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.400]   I would say instead of three to four times per year
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.840]   on average, I probably have one depressive episode
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.360]   every two years.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.640]   - That's a significant improvement.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.480]   - Right.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.360]   I mean, from a quality of life perspective,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.080]   those are two different people.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.280]   And that then led me to,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.320]   and as I did with all my workouts, right,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.400]   I took copious notes over the span.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.800]   I mean, now we're looking at 10 plus years.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.320]   So if I were to ever write another book,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.400]   it would probably be related to all of the really
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.480]   fine details of the experiments and my learnings,
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.360]   including some of the more bizarre things
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.400]   over the last 10 years.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.960]   But it would be just a beast to create.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.800]   - With psychedelics, experiences with psychedelics.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.480]   - Psychedelics and sort of psychedelic adjacent,
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.160]   non-ordinary experiences of consciousness,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   which I think often are touching at edges of the same thing,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.080]   which is gonna be controversial for some folks.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   But to come back to the storyline,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.600]   just to put a bow on that,
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.840]   when I saw the personal outcomes for me,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.560]   the anecdata from friends who are facilitators
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.120]   who have worked with thousands of people, right,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.440]   which is a pretty good sample size.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.760]   Still anecdote, but these are people who are very smart,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.440]   who keep records.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.600]   And I believe that these people have spotted patterns
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.120]   that are only going to be possible to test and verify
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.560]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.480]   So I, at least as a means of generating hypotheses,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.580]   I take these people very seriously.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.200]   And then I started to connect with scientists
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.120]   whose work I had read,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.080]   like Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.160]   began looking at the most compelling data
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.880]   related to say MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.400]   and complex PTSD.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.520]   I made the commitment to myself
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.160]   that as soon as I had enough money to move the dial,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.560]   'cause I really felt like these tools
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.680]   were so outside of the normal paradigm
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.000]   of psychiatry and pharmacology.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.600]   And that made me very excited because it was uncrowded.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.200]   There was very little funding coming into the space.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.280]   It was high leverage.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.040]   And I looked at it just as I've looked at
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.660]   my many startup investments.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.000]   Limited downside risk, really high upside potential.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And I should say before that,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   I'd already been funding in a very small way science.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.400]   So the first check I ever wrote was personally
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.040]   to Adam Ghazali's lab at UCSF.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.920]   - Yeah, great lab.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.020]   - Which at the time was looking at software.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.320]   He's not gonna like this description,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.660]   but I'm gonna simplify it.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.160]   Software that might attenuate
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.500]   or reverse age-related cognitive impairment,
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.040]   specifically related to various aspects of attention.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.440]   And that was my first foray into funding
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.680]   early stage science, which was very analogous to me
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.080]   to funding early stage startups.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   And then later on, to touch on the reputational thing,
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.360]   I know this is a TED Talk, so thank you for listening.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.200]   - No, this is great.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.760]   Please, you're always so gracious on your podcast.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.820]   This is what people want.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.740]   This is certainly what I wanna hear.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.580]   - So on the reputational side, you're right that
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.580]   at the time, especially, let's just call it 2013 to 2015,
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.260]   this was not a comfortable national conversation
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.100]   of any type.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.940]   - Yeah, I wouldn't have had this conversation back then.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.860]   - No way.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.660]   - I don't know that I would have lost my job.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.500]   It just would have raised a lot of eyebrows.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.340]   Now such studies are happening at Stanford.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:24.120]   - Yeah, the perception was that these are
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.640]   a professional third rail, at the very least, right?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.780]   Also illegal, therefore, if I talk about them,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.560]   am I giving someone probable cause?
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.160]   Am I gonna get myself in some type
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.520]   of really tricky legal situation, et cetera?
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.160]   There are a lot of considerations.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.840]   But I tested that, just like I was saying,
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.720]   I like to capture my assumptions on paper
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.560]   so I can stress this.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.160]   And I was like, okay, I think that might be true.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.460]   Most people I know think that is true.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.420]   But is it true?
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.800]   How could we test to see if that is true or not?
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   And I decided to crowdfund for a Hopkins pilot study
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.640]   looking at psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.640]   And I thought to myself, okay, we have a couple of things
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.820]   falling in our favor here.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.840]   Number one, depression does not discriminate.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.500]   So across socioeconomic classes, across gender,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.020]   across race, this is a problem.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.840]   Almost everyone knows someone who takes antidepressants
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.120]   who is still depressed.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.500]   Okay, treatment-resistant depression, therefore,
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.240]   is the indication, psilocybin is the intervention.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.960]   Let me crowdfund, and I did that throughout the time,
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.920]   CrowdRise, which was co-founded by Edward Norton,
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.440]   who had become a friend and was--
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.520]   - The actor, Edward Norton. - The actor,
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.340]   who's very smart, very, very, very smart.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.720]   Also one of the best investors I've ever met,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.120]   which a lot of people don't know.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.500]   Very bright guy.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   And so crowdfunded, and I also like to put my money
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.000]   where my mouth is.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.600]   I said, okay, guys, I'm gonna seed this.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.800]   I'm putting in X, the goal is to raise,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.120]   I think it was 80,000, something like that,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.800]   for the following study.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.880]   And then I was like, let's see, let's see what happens.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   And there was basically zero negative blowback.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.700]   And not only was there no discernible negative blowback,
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.740]   a number of people, and this was deliberate,
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.220]   I wanted to see this, a number of people
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.080]   came out of the woodwork to support in a bigger way.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.220]   And I was like, oh, okay, I see you.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.700]   A handful of folks I knew, and I was like, oh, interesting.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.460]   Okay, there are at least a half a dozen folks
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.380]   who are studying the same thing,
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.540]   who are paying attention to the same thing.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.700]   And then I just got bolder.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.660]   I was like, okay, if I tested that, let me push,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.160]   and then let's see what happens, and I'll wait.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   And lo and behold, I realized that the perception
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.800]   did not match the reality.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.340]   The reality was, if you're talking about indications
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.280]   that cause an incredible amount of suffering
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.520]   for a very large number of people,
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.040]   even those who are anti-drug, per se,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.940]   just say no to drugs, want solutions.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.500]   (upbeat music)
