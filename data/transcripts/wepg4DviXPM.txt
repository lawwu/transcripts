[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   So improve the quality of your decisions
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.200]   as much as possible.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.640]   Try to write things down that you're deciding about.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.280]   Get other people, trusted advisors,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   particularly people who have different points of view
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.440]   with you are really important.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.640]   Here's a really important one.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.360]   You have to give permission.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   So when we're trying to seek information from other people,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.760]   we think that permission is implied
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.560]   for them to say whatever to us,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.780]   but we have to actually offer that permission
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.960]   and they have to be willing to give it to us.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.400]   So I'm sure this has happened to you.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160]   You like fire someone
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.920]   or you break up with somebody or whatever.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040]   And as soon as you do that,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000]   you have a whole bunch of friends who say,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   "Oh, I'm so glad you did that.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.400]   I thought you should have done that like six months ago."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.440]   Has that one happened to you?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.360]   - That one hasn't 'cause my wife and I started dating,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.440]   oh gosh, 2004.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.040]   So it's been a long time since I've had that conversation.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.200]   I'm sure it has, but boy, has it been a while.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.000]   - But like, or you fire someone or you quit your job
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.440]   or whatever. - Yeah, for sure.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.280]   - And people say,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.240]   "I bet you might've said it to somebody when they break up.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.200]   Like, oh, I'm so happy 'cause really,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.000]   wish you would've done that sooner."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.040]   So this is like a really common thing that happens.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   You know, "Oh, I'm so happy you quit your job.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.800]   Like, you were so miserable every single day.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.520]   I knew you should have done that like a long time ago."
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   And your thought when people say that to you is,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.600]   "Okay, but like, why didn't you tell me?"
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.920]   And the answer is because
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.880]   there wasn't any explicit permission given.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.040]   So in order to really find out what somebody thinks,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.920]   you have to give them permission to say what they think.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.240]   - Yeah, I saw this so much in venture capital
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.400]   that I would be in meetings with other venture investors
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   and they'd give feedback to founders saying,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.760]   "Oh, like, I think it's like pretty good,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.720]   but it's not a good fit."
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then after they'd turn to me and be like,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.160]   "God, that company's horrible. It's terrible."
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.800]   I was like, "We should have just told him that."
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.640]   - That's right.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.880]   - And I think everyone feels bad telling them that.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   And now every time someone asks me
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.040]   for feedback on their startup, I'm like,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.600]   "How honest do you want me to be?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440]   Like, do you want me to tell you to quit?"
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.800]   So I guess if you're on the other side,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.840]   you can also invite someone to invite you
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.880]   to be more honest and give critical feedback.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.680]   - Yeah, so I actually do that with my friends.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.120]   I'm like, "Are we having a conversation
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.040]   where you want advice
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   or where you're just offloading, like, your emotion?"
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.160]   'Cause I wanna know, right?
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.120]   Because sometimes they don't really want your advice.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.520]   So I think that's really important.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.040]   I mean, I think that's just really important.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   I think Ron Conway, who founded SV Angel,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   is such a good example of doing this really well,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360]   like being a very good decision coach to somebody.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   So he would actually tell the companies
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   what he thought of them.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.920]   But he would sit down and he'd basically say like,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.640]   "I think we can admit this isn't working."
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.960]   As opposed to, "Eh, it seems pretty good.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.280]   Just keep going."
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   He'd be like, "Look, it's not working."
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   And invariably the founders would push back on him
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.240]   and say, "No, but I know we can turn it around."
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240]   So it wasn't so much disagreement that it wasn't working,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.280]   'cause I think everybody knows
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.960]   when things aren't working very well,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.200]   but it was always, "No, but we can turn it around."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   So he was trying to coach them into letting go, right?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.280]   And founders are gritty by nature.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.040]   Of course they don't wanna let go.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.240]   So when they said, "No, but I think I can turn it around,"
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   his tactic was not to disagree with them,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   which I think would have just caused a rift,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.240]   but to say, "Okay, tell me exactly
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.040]   what turning it around looks like."
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.080]   So like, let's think about the next two months, right?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.400]   So you're saying you're gonna turn this around.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.880]   What exactly does that look like?
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.800]   And try to figure out what those benchmarks are.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.720]   Now he would sit down and do that with the founder
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.120]   so that the founder now owned that
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.280]   sort of along with Ron Conway.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   And this is a really good trick for decision-making
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.520]   is that often your decision-making is at its worst
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.600]   when you're trying to make the decision right then,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.840]   like when you're actually facing the decision down.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.080]   And this is something that really improves decision quality
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.760]   is to think in advance.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400]   As much as possible, do advanced planning on your decisions.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.640]   It's much more efficient.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.920]   It creates much better decisions.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.240]   So that's essentially what he's doing in this moment.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.040]   He's saying, "Let's think about two months ago,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   two months from now, rather.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.800]   So we're gonna think about two months from now
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.040]   or three months from now, the end of the next quarter.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.800]   Let's think about what this is gonna look like
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.120]   when you've turned it around."
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   And then basically just set a set of benchmarks.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.880]   And then in three months, you can sit down with them
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520]   and say, "But you haven't hit them."
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.160]   And we agreed that that's what it looked like.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.120]   And that actually makes those decisions a lot cleaner.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.440]   And you can do that
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.400]   with your personal decisions as well, right?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.440]   Like if you ever, we're all in these situations
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.960]   like you have a relationship where it's not,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.520]   it's just not going well,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.360]   but you feel like you can turn it around.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.280]   You feel like you have so much time invested
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.760]   and you do love the person, but you're like unhappy,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   but you know, you can make it change.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.400]   There's kind of two things to do is not,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.520]   don't face the decision down right then, figure out,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   but what does change look like?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.560]   So at that moment, say,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.000]   "How long am I willing to tolerate the status quo,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.200]   the way that the relationship is right now or worse?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   What do I need to do, do I think,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.720]   in order to turn this around?"
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   And then however long that is
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.920]   that you're willing to tolerate the status quo,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.240]   figure out at the end of that time period,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.520]   say it's six months,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.360]   what does change look like?
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.480]   What will it look like
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.840]   when things have actually turned around here?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.920]   You can do this for a job, right?
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.240]   A job that you're miserable in.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.160]   What do I need to do?
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.200]   What will it look like that it's actually turned around?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720]   What will have changed?
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.520]   And the reason that you need to do that
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.400]   is because when you're actually facing down the decision,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.640]   that's when you're most likely
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   to be rationalizing things away.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.680]   That's when your forecasts are gonna be really inaccurate.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.280]   That's when the things that you want to be true of the world
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.920]   are going to influence your actions the most.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.400]   It's when everything kind of goes to crap.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.560]   And the way that I try to sort of put it to people
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.680]   to get them to understand this
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.720]   is that you can say all you want
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.800]   that you don't wanna eat sugar,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.600]   but when there's a cupcake right in front of you,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.640]   it's really hard to say no.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.280]   And that's true, not just of like cupcakes or pizza
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.600]   or whatever that are sitting right in front of you.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.840]   It's also true like when you're facing a breakup
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.600]   or you're facing having to fire an employee, which isn't fun,
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.160]   or you're facing wanting to quit your job, right?
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.480]   Or break up with a friend or whatever.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.240]   These things are very hard to do
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   because it's that moment where we're worried
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.120]   about all the time we've put into something,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.800]   whether it's that moment where you go from
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.560]   in a state of failing to having failed.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.120]   Because as long as you keep going,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   you might turn it around and not have to actually
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.120]   sort of put that failure on the books.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.440]   You know, like if you buy a stock and you bought it at 50
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.320]   and it goes to 30, as long as you hold,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   you could get back to 50.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.200]   - Yeah, but selling now is kind of accepting that.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.760]   - It's accepting that, and that's really hard for us.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.400]   So that's why we want to think about both.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   How do we ask for permission for people to tell us the truth?
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.160]   How do we explicitly ask people if they want the truth?
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.120]   Right, so we need to have both of those things going on.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.320]   And then how do we also figure out
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.040]   how the person can receive the truth?
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   And that's true whether we're coaching somebody else
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.760]   or we're thinking about how we can do this for ourselves.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.880]   And one of the best ways for us to receive the truth
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.320]   is for us to think about the truth
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.680]   is something in the future.
