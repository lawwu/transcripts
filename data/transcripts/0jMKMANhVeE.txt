[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.320]   So, here are the top three things
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.620]   I took away from this conference.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.120]   Number one, Bill Bernstein is actually
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.080]   a self-admitted market timer.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   Number two, my beloved Vanguard Total Market Index Fund
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.000]   is actually actively managed.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   But number three, and this came from Alan Roth,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260]   a risky and unhealthy lifestyle
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.200]   is good for your retirement plan
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.160]   because it lowers your life expectancy.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.660]   Okay, now.
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.080]   - Jim and Katie Dolly, we just wanna thank you
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.300]   for your efforts here.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.960]   You all already got a shout out,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.800]   but we are so grateful from this conference.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   We could not have done it without you.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.020]   Katie, especially behind the scenes,
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.640]   you were just such a gift to us.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.720]   So, thank you for that.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.560]   We appreciate it.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960]   And Jim, of course, as a speaker
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.360]   and creating the curriculum for our University Day.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.040]   Wanna thank our video guys.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   We have committed to videotaping all of these conferences
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.600]   so that people who can't afford to attend
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.520]   can still view the sessions.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.660]   So, the team from Little Cabin has been here videotaping,
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.480]   and they've also been doing some nice testimonials
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.240]   with some of you where you've been talking
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.480]   about what you've gained from the conference
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   and what you've gained from Bogleheads.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   We intend to use those to promote future conferences.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.640]   So, thank you to our video team.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.520]   We really, really appreciate it.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.440]   I also wanted to thank Jim and Connor from Spark Network
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.240]   who have helped us put on this conference.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.200]   So, I hope they're here.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.520]   There's Jim.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.060]   Connor, in the back.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.240]   To the extent that this conference feels at all polished
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   or professional, all these guys.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.660]   They have meant everything in terms of our registration,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.400]   just in terms of making everything go
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   as smoothly as it can go.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.880]   And we are just so grateful for their contributions
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.700]   to Bogleheads.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.580]   So, thank you, Jim and Connor.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.200]   I also wanted to mention a program
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.880]   that's been happening at this conference
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.800]   a little bit behind the scenes,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   which is that we decided to try to offer scholarships
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   this year to folks who would not be otherwise able
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   to attend the conference.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.600]   And so, this is something that we have been using
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.760]   our own coffers to cover these registrations for people.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.980]   Rick was very helpful for me in terms of winnowing down
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.520]   the number of worthy requests to the people
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   who we wanted to have here because they truly
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.060]   did have a financial need.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.760]   So, we'll keep this scholarship program going.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.000]   The idea is to make this conference available
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   to people who otherwise might find it unaffordable.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.640]   We also have a student program.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.800]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.880]   Yes, and one thing I would say is that we also had
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.200]   some people cancel who were ill or had some reason
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.480]   they couldn't make the conference.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   Some of them generously donated their registration
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.520]   to cover some of these scholars.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   So, we are so grateful.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   They're not here, obviously, but we're very grateful
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.940]   for people who choose to do that.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.600]   So, bear that in mind if you attend a conference
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.160]   in the future and can't make it in the end.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.720]   We are also going to continue to invite students
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.280]   to be part of this conference.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.960]   That'll be something that we will work on
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.640]   in future conferences.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.200]   We do have, I think, a couple of financial planning
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   students in attendance, but we're going to continue
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.740]   to drive that effort to bring students here.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.480]   Finally, we want to thank our wonderful volunteers
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.160]   who we could not have this conference without.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.800]   So, please join me in thanking all of the people
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.120]   who volunteered their time.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   Okay.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.920]   I have a couple more.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.520]   Speakers, every speaker here was not,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.880]   no speaker was paid for his or her time.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.800]   It's on a weekend.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   We had great speakers, a fabulous lineup,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.680]   and these are all people who generously
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.040]   volunteered their time.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.440]   And last but not least, all of you,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.240]   our biggest Bogleheads conference ever.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.900]   You make it what it is.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.160]   - Okay.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.680]   There is one person who needs to be thanked
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.200]   for the reason why all of you are here,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.680]   and she is standing right next to me.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.920]   Christine.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.520]   Thank you.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.240]   Christine has been the chairman of this conference.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.880]   She does a full-time job at Morningstar.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.960]   She is the president of the John C. Bogle Center
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   for the Financial Literacy, and she actually
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.160]   has some sort of a life as well, I think.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.360]   Do you not?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.600]   Great job, Christine.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.920]   - Thank you so much, Rick, and thanks to all of you.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.200]   It's been a super fun effort.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   It's a nice kind of, my husband calls it
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.440]   my unpaid part-time job, so it's been fun.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   Now, we're gonna announce the 2024 conference site.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.000]   We are so excited to announce, go ahead, cue it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.740]   Minneapolis, Twin Cities.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.920]   The local chapter in the Twin Cities
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.760]   has expressed an interest, a lot of interest,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.800]   in being the host city, and we are so excited
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.000]   to work with them on planning next year's conference,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.700]   and we think we'll have an even greater conference
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.680]   than we've had this year.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.600]   Thank you all.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.960]   That's it?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.780]   Thank you.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.200]   Be safe going home.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
