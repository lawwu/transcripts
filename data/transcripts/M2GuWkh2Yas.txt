[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.880]   the Gospel according to Saint John in the fourth chapter, and reading verses 13 and
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.040]   14, verses 13 and 14, in the fourth chapter, the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.320]   Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.720]   life."
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   We come back once more to this great and wonderful statement, which we've been considering together
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320]   for some four or five Sunday mornings.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.000]   Now I'm calling attention to this as I've been explaining, because here we have what
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   is really essential Christianity.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.320]   This is what it means to be a Christian, that we have within us a well of water, springing
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.880]   up into everlasting life.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.220]   That whatever may happen to us, we never thirst.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.720]   This is the great offer of the Gospel.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040]   We are concerned to demonstrate this, as we've been concerned to demonstrate the same point
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.320]   in the earlier portions, the first three chapters of this Gospel.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000]   We are working our way through it, as you remember, keeping our eye in particular on
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.600]   this great central message of the Gospel of John, which is thus stated in the 16th verse
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.200]   of the first chapter, you remember, "Of his fullness have all we received, and grace upon
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   grace, grace added to grace."
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.360]   That is true Christianity.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.320]   Now the danger is, as we've been saying, that we stop so far short of that.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.920]   Some of us think of it merely in terms of forgiveness.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   Others think of it in terms of some experiences or some happiness that we may have or not
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760]   have.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.920]   But this is essential Christianity.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   It isn't merely an intellectual acceptance of creeds, that's included, but it doesn't
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   stop at that.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   That is meant to lead on to this, that we receive of his fullness, and grace upon grace,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760]   developing, expanding, growing, glorious life.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.840]   But here our Lord puts it to the woman of Samaria, the same thing, in these words, "Whosoever
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.200]   drinketh of this water, the water of that well shall thirst again.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.320]   But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.280]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him as a well of water, springing up
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.840]   into everlasting life."
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.520]   Well now my friends, I start there for this morning with a question that I've been putting
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.280]   on the previous mornings.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   Have you got this?
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.880]   This is the question.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.920]   Have you got this?
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   What is your religion?
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.720]   Is it something that you do, or is it something that's happening within you?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.800]   Have you got life?
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.160]   Have you got this well of water within you, springing up into everlasting life?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.640]   To be content with anything short of that is so wrong, it's so sad.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.120]   It's wrong and sad from our own personal standpoints.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   Why should we live as paupers when we are meant to be princes?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.920]   Why should we be in a state of penury when we are meant to enjoy plenty?
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.280]   Is nothing more tragic than Christian people who have stayed at the beginning, remained
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.080]   children, still concerned about the first principles of the gospel of Christ, and who
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.760]   know nothing about the exceeding riches of his grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   Is there anything so sad as that people should have all this offered them and still not know
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   it, not possess it, and not enjoy it?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.520]   Well now, that's what we are considering.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.560]   Why is it that so many of us fall so far short of this?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.320]   Well my whole suggestion is that in this story of the woman of Samaria, Our Lord's meeting
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.160]   with the woman of Samaria, we are given in a very remarkable manner an account of some
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.560]   of the main hindrances and obstacles to the receiving of this great gift that the Son
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   of God came from heaven to this world to give us.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.200]   It's extraordinary how it comes out here, and we've seen a good deal of it already.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.880]   People generally take this in an evangelistic way, that's quite all right, but it can be
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   taken in this way also, and it's still more important.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.040]   You see, here, to this woman, Our Lord offers the Christian life at its very fullest and
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.400]   highest.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.680]   So it applies to all of us, and we've seen already how we have often been robbed of this
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.200]   blessing because of the very things that we see in this woman.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.640]   National prejudices, Jew and Samaritan.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.320]   Nationality comes into these things.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.400]   It's very prominent in the world today, and it's hindering people from knowing the full
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.240]   blessing of salvation.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   Social prejudices.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.800]   Oh, I needn't mention them, we've been through them.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.880]   These natural prejudices are a constant source of hindrance.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.840]   Then we dealt with what we call the spiritual dullness, spiritual slowness.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.480]   This woman holds on to the material level all along, keeps on thinking that Our Lord's
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.960]   talking about that material, physical well, when he wasn't.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.080]   He was talking about something spiritual, but she couldn't get it, and we are so dull.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.080]   We materialize everything, even our very religion.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.040]   And then we dealt with what I described as evasiveness, and how perfectly it's illustrated
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   here.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.200]   Now the woman goes from the point of something else.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.280]   Our Lord is dealing with her, and she raises theological questions, wriggles, tries to
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.200]   get out of it, but Our Lord pins her down.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.520]   We all are experts at this evasiveness, balancing one thing against another, anything to avoid
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.000]   the real issue, which is just this.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.720]   Have we got this well of water within us?
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   It just comes to that.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.800]   You've got it or you haven't got it, and you know whether you've got it or not.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.200]   And we mustn't allow any other thought or consideration to obtrude itself between us
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.920]   and facing this one vital central question.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   And then last Sunday morning we came on to this other matter, which is wrong and false
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.400]   ideas about worship and about God, and that's what I'm dealing with this morning.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:47.480]   Now this comes out particularly in verses 19 to 24 of this fourth chapter.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.800]   You remember Our Lord has told the woman to go and fetch her husband.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.520]   He's pinned her down to the moral need from which she was suffering, the thing she was
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   evading.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.080]   The man she was living with was not her husband.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   She's had five husbands.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   She's living in adultery.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.200]   But though she's living in adultery, she can talk about religion, and she can be very
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.960]   clever in her arguments about religion.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   That's it.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   We know about it.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.280]   Well then the woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.520]   Our father's worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   where men ought to worship.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.200]   mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.000]   You worship you know not what.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.640]   We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jew.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:50.120]   But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.480]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.440]   For the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:04.560]   God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.040]   Now last Sunday morning we considered the false ideas we all have, and have had, and
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:17.760]   perhaps may still have, concerning worship, and concerning God, the God whom we worship.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.000]   Now we tend to locate him in buildings, and think that buildings are essential places,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.880]   conditions, all these things.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.280]   We looked at the ways in which we all tend to go astray, and our wrong ideas about God,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.200]   as if God were just some agency to give us the blessings we go and ask for.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   People go like that of God, and he's just some great repository of blessings, and they
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.360]   think they can take them, claim them.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:52.040]   They use the word claim, take it by faith they say, as if God were some passive agency
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.120]   I say from which we can extract blessings.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.480]   Well we looked into some of these false ideas concerning worship, and our false ideas of
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.100]   God, and the two things obviously are very closely interrelated.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.600]   But come, let's look at it positively this morning.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.640]   Here's the great question.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.880]   Are we true worshippers?
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.760]   The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers must worship the Father in spirit
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.120]   and in truth.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.680]   Are we true worshippers?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.320]   Here's the question.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.040]   Now what does this mean?
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.360]   Well the first thing we have to do surely is this.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.420]   The true means real, real worshippers.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.720]   We can think we are worshippers without being worshippers, but we must be real worshippers,
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.920]   true worshippers, genuine worshippers.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   How do we become?
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.640]   Well let's start with the question, what is worship?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.000]   Here is a question that needs to be asked surely, because we tend to use this word wrongly.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.640]   We use it sometimes in such a vague way that it finally means nothing.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.860]   Now the root meaning of the Hebrew word which is translated by the word worship in the Old
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:17.560]   Testament means to bow down, to bow down, and that is the essence of true worship.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:25.080]   It means that we bow down in the presence of God.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.920]   This is something that I could illustrate to you at great length.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.640]   Take for instance what we are told in the Ten Commandments where we are prohibited from
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.880]   making any graven image.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:44.160]   And then the commandment goes on in Exodus 25, "Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.520]   or serve them."
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   That's the idea.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.900]   Bowing down, it is of the very essence of worship.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.460]   And then there is a particularly clear definition of this in connection with the temptations
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.520]   of our Lord in the wilderness.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.880]   Let me read to you from the Gospel according to St. Matthew, chapter 4, verses 8 to 10.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:14.680]   "Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.860]   of the world and the glory of them, and saith unto him, All these things will I give you
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:27.160]   if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.440]   Fall down and worship me.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.760]   "Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.040]   the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:49.480]   Well now there you see is the basic notion and idea in connection with the meaning of
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.320]   this word "worship."
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.820]   And it's very important that we should realize exactly what it means and its uniqueness.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.320]   Now the whole life of the Christian should be lived in the service of God.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.100]   But the whole life of the Christian is not worship.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.520]   Worship is a very special act.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.760]   Our whole life, I say, should be lived to the glory of God.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.520]   But to say therefore that the whole of one's life is worship is just to confuse terms.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   And indeed it is a very dangerous confusion.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.320]   And I'm elaborating this point because there is a good deal of such teaching at the present
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   time.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.360]   There are people who say, "Well if you've given your life to God and if you live the
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:39.480]   whole of your life to the glory of God, the whole of your life is an act of worship."
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.240]   That is just, I say, to confuse the meaning of terms and is to miss the special meaning
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   of this word "worship."
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.320]   Now there are people, you see, who do the same thing in connection with prayer.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.480]   I know a very orthodox Christian people who don't have prayer meetings in their churches.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.480]   Why?
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.240]   Well they've intellectualized the whole of the Christian faith.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.800]   They spend their time in thinking about God and in trying to work that out in practice
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   and in detail.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.160]   They say the whole of one's life is prayer, but it isn't.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.440]   Prayer, again, is a special action.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.720]   It's right that the whole life is lived for God.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   The demand of God is a totalitarian demand and we should love him with all our heart
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.320]   and mind and soul and strength.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.960]   Yes, that's right, the whole life is to be in the service of God.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.440]   But these particular actions are special and we are taught about them in a special way
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.360]   in the Bible itself.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.480]   And it's important we should realize this therefore about worship and about prayer and
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.840]   about thanksgiving and the various aspects of this matter.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.320]   So let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.680]   Let me put it to you negatively.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.000]   To read the Bible is not worship in and of itself.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   It is something that should lead to worship, but it isn't worship.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.760]   I read the Bible and I meditate upon it, that's all right, but I can do all that and still
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.320]   not worship.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:21.120]   If I read properly and truly, as I say, it should lead me to worship God.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.440]   But it isn't worship in and of itself.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.040]   The same thing is true even of praying.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.400]   Prayer is not of necessity worship.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.440]   Once more I say prayer should always lead to worship.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:41.680]   But you can pray and spend your time in prayer with petitions or even with thanksgiving,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.140]   but still you haven't of necessity worshipped.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.000]   And this is where I think so many of us tend to go astray.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.200]   We forget the most important aspect of all, which is this act of worship.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.680]   Now, we often call a service like this a public worship.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.120]   Well it should be, but it isn't always.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:10.520]   We can go through a service and alas there may be no true or real worship at all.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.720]   What we've done is all right, but we've stopped short of an act of true worship.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.800]   The same thing applies to singing.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.280]   Singing should lead to worship and singing should be worship in and of itself if you're
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.880]   singing a hymn that is conducive to worship and contains the vital element of worship
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   in it.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.440]   But all singing, again, is not worship and we mustn't assume that.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.880]   The same applies to listening to sermons or lectures or addresses.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   Alas, here again is something that may stop well short of worship.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.120]   A sermon worthy of the name should always lead to worship and if it doesn't it's a
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   bad sermon.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.440]   If it ends with a preacher or some particular thing he said it's missed the mark, it's
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   missed the aim.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.040]   All the purpose of preaching is to lead us to worship God.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.480]   Well then what does it mean?
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:14.760]   Well it means bowing down before God and adoring him for himself.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.640]   You see that's why I'm drawing a distinction between prayer and worship.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.080]   Prayer, if it's just petition, is not worship.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.680]   Prayer, if it's just thanksgiving, is not worship.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.840]   You may be grateful, you may thank God for blessings that he's given you, but you see
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   you can be so interested in and concerned about the blessing that you forget the one
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.000]   who has blessed you.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.240]   And the peculiar thing about worship is that it is this bowing down before God himself
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   and being concerned about God himself apart from what he does, what he does to us and
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.480]   all the blessings we have had.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.120]   Just because he is God that we fall before him, bow before him and worship him, adore
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   him.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   Now there are many examples of this I read to you out of the 34th chapter of the book
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.560]   of Exodus because there is a perfect illustration of what I'm trying to say.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.040]   When God gave this revelation of himself to Moses he fell.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.120]   He just fell to the ground and worshipped.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.660]   You'll find exactly the same thing in connection with Joshua, in the book of Joshua.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:34.080]   You'll find that Joshua bowed down before him in exactly the same way and simply worshipped
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   God.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.880]   The revelation was given to him in chapter 5 of the book of Joshua in verses 13 and 14.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.280]   This is what I read.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.640]   And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.880]   behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   went unto him and said unto him, "Art thou for us or for our adversaries?"
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   And he said, "Nay, but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come."
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.960]   And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and say unto him.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   That's worship.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   He realized the presence.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.080]   He hadn't understood.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.120]   He was putting his question, concerned about this fight and about this victory that he
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   was desired, as we do you see in so much of our praying.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.920]   But here when he realizes the presence of God he fell down on his face to the earth
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   and did worship.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.460]   Now there are many other examples I could give of the same thing and you had that perfect
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.480]   description of worship in that fourth chapter of the book of Revelation that I read at the
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.880]   beginning.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.440]   They fall down before him.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.100]   That's worship.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.760]   So you see this is something very special and very unique.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.840]   And we mustn't forget this because this is the high water mark of the whole of our
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.340]   relationship to God.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.640]   And that's the thing about which our Lord is speaking to the woman of Samaria.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.400]   She's got a mechanical notions in this mountain.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.640]   So many today you can only worship in a given type of building and ceremonial and ritual
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.400]   and the things we were dealing with last Sunday morning and read prayers and so on.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   All right my dear friends if they can help you use them.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.360]   But all I say is this have they led you to worship?
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.920]   Do we know what it is to fall down in the presence of God and adore him because he is
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.200]   who and what he is.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.440]   Now let me give you an example out of literature of this self same thing.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.160]   Just showing how this is not confined to biblical times, neither Old Testament nor the New.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:52.240]   This is the great thing of course that happens in every time of revival and of reawakening.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:59.440]   And you get it in the individual experiences of men also who have had some signal manifestation
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.660]   of the glory of God and who have been filled with the spirit and who have been greatly
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660]   used of God.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.800]   Let me give you this one illustration.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.960]   You'll find it in the journals of John Wesley for January the 1st 1739.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.280]   And I often think that this was a more important and vital experience in the life of John Wesley
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.200]   even than that which happened to him at Aldersgate Street on May the 24th 1738.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.580]   This is what he tells us.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:33.880]   He and his brother Charles and George Whitfield and Joseph Ingham and some others were met
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.960]   together in Fetter Lane in the room they used to meet at in Fetter Lane having what they
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.520]   called a love feast.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.000]   And there they had been together for hours.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.440]   And then this is what he says.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   About three o'clock in the morning as we were continuing instant in prayer the power
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.280]   of God came mightily upon us.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:08.360]   Inasmuch that many cried out for exceeding joy and many fell to the ground.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.520]   As soon as we were recovered a little from the awe and the amazement at the presence
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:20.240]   of his majesty we broke out with one voice.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.300]   We praise thee O God.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.200]   We acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.840]   They began to sing the tedium which you and I sang just now.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.460]   But you see the difference.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.280]   They didn't sing it because at a given point in the service it was given out as a number
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.640]   or something to do.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.000]   As soon as we were recovered a little from the awe and amazement at the presence of his
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   majesty we broke out with one voice.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.200]   We praise thee O God.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.780]   We acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.120]   They knew that they were in his presence.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:11.960]   As he puts it you see as we were continuing instant in prayer the power of God came mightily
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.960]   upon us.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   Now there are people you see who not only know nothing about that but even argue against
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   it.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.520]   They say as long as you're a Christian you've given your whole life to God.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.240]   You don't look for anything further you just go on serving God.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.040]   You don't worry about any experience.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.840]   Oh what a tragedy.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.960]   This is the object of all knowledge.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   If your theology doesn't bring you to something like this it's of very little value to you
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.760]   or anything else you may have.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.080]   All your diligence, all your assiduity in these matters, all your concern it's of no
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.080]   value.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.120]   This, this is what we are meant to come to.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   This is worship.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   You bow down.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   You're humbled.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   You're silenced.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:57.680]   You're filled with awe at the presence of his majesty and you can do nothing but adore
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   him.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.160]   Now that is true worship.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Now don't misunderstand me.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.640]   I'm not here to say stop praying therefore unless you've always experienced this.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.380]   No, no that would be quite wrong.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   We must go on praying.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.960]   We must do everything else.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.160]   But all I'm saying is this that the real danger confronting us all is to stop at what
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   we do.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.440]   To stop at the means of grace.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.040]   To stop at our own Bible reading, our own prayer, our own diligence.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.640]   Oh what a tragedy it is to stop at the means and fail to see that God has provided them
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.520]   for us in order to lead us on to this act of worship.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   The high water mark.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.000]   Go through your Bible.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Go through the biographies of the saints and you'll find that this is the highest point
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.200]   that any man can ever reach.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.840]   It is, you see, a foretaste of heavenliness.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.740]   This is a glimpse of the glory.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.560]   This is a touch of the everlasting.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.240]   This is the essence of true worship.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.840]   Oh don't merge this into something general.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   Don't miss this.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   Don't lose this.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.760]   The first thing we've got to realize is the essential character of worship and we must
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.600]   be content with nothing less than this.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.420]   It is right, it is our duty to pray.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:21.080]   But if you go through your life just saying your prayers without knowing anything of what
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:29.680]   it is to fall down before God, well I'm not saying it isn't Christian, but it's Christianity
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.160]   at its very lowest.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.760]   You're only just in the kingdom.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   And here are the riches.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.560]   Here are the glorious possibilities.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.880]   Our Lord died on the cross not merely that our sins might be forgiven, but as Peter puts
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:51.240]   it, he died, he gave himself for us that he might bring us to God.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:58.840]   Or as Hebrews 10, 19 puts it, "Having boldness therefore, brethren, to enter into the holiest
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.600]   of all by the blood of Jesus."
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   What's your thinking about the blood of Jesus?
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:11.000]   Do you stop at forgiveness or do you realize that this blood brings you into the presence,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.280]   into the holiest of all?
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.480]   And there you realize the presence and you worship him, you bow down before him.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.440]   Well as I say, there it is in individual experiences and a revival, the great revivals in the history
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   of the church.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.200]   Ah, but wonderful records of this very thing.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   You read about people who've been Christians for years and good people, but suddenly the
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.000]   revival comes, the spirit of God is poured out.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.200]   And they're overwhelmed as Wesley was.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.120]   If ever there was a man who was non-emotional, it was John Wesley.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.840]   Hard-headed as it were, intellectual, the scholar.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.440]   As far as you can imagine a man to be from emotionalism.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.040]   But listen to what John Wesley has to say about himself on that occasion.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.400]   And this is the thing I say that happens in revival.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.600]   Here are people and suddenly the power of God, the glory of God is made manifest.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.080]   And the result is as he describes it sometimes they literally fall to the floor, overwhelmed.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.720]   They feel they're nobody, they feel they're nothing.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.520]   They feel doubtful as to whether they've ever been Christians at all.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   They doubt whether they've ever really prayed, they've never really worshipped.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.520]   They've been taking things from God, they've been using Christ just to soothe their consciences,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.320]   they've been interested only in the first principles of the gospel of Christ.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.920]   But now they know.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.960]   And that is revival.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.920]   The sense of the glory of God and there's nothing to do but to fall before him and to
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:58.120]   adore him in wondering adoration and worship and praise.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.760]   Well there is something of a definition of what is meant by worship.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.200]   I'm concerned to show the uniqueness of this act and that we must be content with nothing
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   less.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.400]   Don't listen to people who say to you, "Oh you're a Christian, you've given your life
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.880]   to God, you just go on serving, don't worry."
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.760]   Oh my dear friend, this is what you're offered.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.520]   If you're not anxious to obtain this, if you're not thirsting for this, if you're not longing
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.480]   for this, well then I say all your understanding has missed the point.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   You're misinterpreting the scriptures and the great Christian tradition.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.600]   Very well then, how are we to come to this point?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:45.120]   Well the second principle that I find here is this, that we must submit ourselves entirely
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.880]   to the teaching of the Bible concerning this matter.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   Now our Lord puts it like this.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.960]   He turns to the woman and he says, "Ye worship ye know not what.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.840]   We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jew."
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.480]   Now that's the most important statement from every standpoint.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.800]   What it means in its essence is this.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.760]   These Samaritans as you know, they only had the five books of Moses.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.040]   That's the whole they had of the Old Testament.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.880]   They hadn't got the prophets and their teaching, they hadn't got the book of Psalms, just the
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.800]   Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, and no more.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.440]   Now our Lord is including that partly in his statement here.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.160]   And of course they'd even narrowed the five books of Moses down to the mechanics, this
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.320]   mountain and the particular ritual that they believed in and so on.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.760]   And here was this dispute as to whether you should worship here or there, whether you
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.680]   should stand or kneel, or you know, the interest that is so common today in postures and in
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.360]   ceremony and ritual and mere externals of religion, oh the tragedy of it all.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.960]   "No, no," says our Lord, "you don't know, you don't understand.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.120]   We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jew."
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:12.840]   That being interpreted for us means this, that we don't start with our ideas of worship.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   That's the danger.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.480]   We don't take men's ideas of worship.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:22.760]   The history of the church shows us so plainly that as the centuries pass, men always try
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.720]   to add to worship and they work up a system.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.800]   And that is why you see, when you look at something like the Roman Catholic Church of
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.600]   today and compare it and contrast it with the Christian church as you see here in the
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.000]   New Testament, you feel you're in two entirely different worlds.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.520]   Well, where have they got all that they do from?
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.600]   Well, they've added it, they've borrowed.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.280]   They borrowed from the Old Testament things that they should have left behind, even according
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.480]   to the teaching of the Scripture, but they borrowed from the mystery religions.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.440]   Whenever they went to a country, they took over.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.320]   They believed it was the right thing to do.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.280]   They incorporated into the act of Christian worship and praise and so on, the various
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.680]   things that these pagans were already doing, this kind of syncretism.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.760]   And so you elaborate and elaborate and elaborate it, and all the attention is paid to the externals
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.560]   and the trappings and the vital and the real thing are never known and are never experienced
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.240]   at all.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.600]   So we've got to turn away from that.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.320]   You can have textbooks which will teach you, they claim, how to worship.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.520]   And there are people who are experts in liturgies and things of that kind and litanies and so
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.560]   on, and they can teach you.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.200]   And it's very beautiful and very wonderful, they say, but the question is, does it lead
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   to worship?
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.800]   What are you being moved by?
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.200]   Are you being moved by the stained glass windows?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.280]   Are you being moved by the beauty of the diction or the exact precision of the arrangement
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   of the service?
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.600]   You can be moved aesthetically.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.240]   And we often fool ourselves, we think that's a spiritual experience, but it isn't.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.280]   This and this alone is true worship.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.600]   So I say we must go back and receive our instructions from the Bible itself.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.200]   Now let me put it like this to you.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:20.320]   Look at the trouble God took, if I may so put it, in instructing Moses as to worship.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.960]   I know there it was chiefly external, but it's all symbolic and it's all meant to convey
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.800]   to us the real essential spirit.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.040]   That's why our Lord says, "The hour cometh and now is," when it's not going to be either
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.880]   there or even in Jerusalem.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:46.520]   Not even in Jerusalem, because it is something that is done in spirit and in truth.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.800]   But you see there is this instruction given simply to convey to us the idea that our own
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   thoughts concerning this are quite inadequate and we must be instructed by God himself as
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   to how we are to worship.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.560]   Now there is an incident in the Old Testament that surely ought to fix this in our minds
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.160]   once and forever.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.920]   Do you remember the story about what is called the rebellion of Korah?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.400]   There were three men in the camp of Israel, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.480]   They were very prominent princes and they were very able men, but they became jealous
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.680]   of Moses and Aaron.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.360]   They said, "Who are these two men who are to get unto themselves the right to dictate
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.760]   to us as to how we should worship God?
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   We know as well as they do how God is to be worshipped."
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.520]   So they set themselves up and they called a public meeting and they addressed the crowd
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.960]   and the people were very ready to listen to them and to agree with them.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.900]   People are always ready to listen to new ideas on worship and so on, always after some novelty
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.760]   and after some addition.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.960]   And they persuaded the people.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   The rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.840]   They said, "This is how we should worship, not the way that these other men tell you
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.120]   that you must always do."
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.320]   Well, you remember what happened.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.400]   God punished Korah, Dathan, and Abiram in the most terrible manner and all the people
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   that had agreed with them.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.320]   The ground opened and they were swallowed up and disappeared.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.600]   But God didn't leave it at that.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.920]   He called Moses and said, "I want this to be fixed and established in the minds and
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.560]   the hearts of this people as long as they live and all their descendants after them."
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:36.640]   And so, you remember, he told him to get the twelve princes of the tribes of Israel and
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.600]   each one, the prince, was to bring a rod with him and each man was to write his name upon
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   the rod.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.760]   Then they were to hand them to Moses and Moses was to put them in the tabernacle.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.560]   And God said, "Now leave them in the tabernacle overnight and go in in the morning and look
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.760]   at the rods.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.080]   You'll find that one of them will have commenced to bud.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   Pick it out.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.960]   Write your name on it for that is the name of the man who is teaching the truth as I
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.800]   have it and as I've given it."
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.720]   And they did this.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.760]   And Moses went into the tabernacle the following morning.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.240]   He saw one of the rods had budded.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   He pulled it out.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   The name, Aaron.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.040]   Aaron's rod that budded.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.780]   And God said to Moses, "Take that and put it in the ark of the covenant so that it may
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.360]   be a permanent memorial to the children of Israel concerning this matter."
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   What matter?
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.720]   Well, just this very question of worship.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.960]   It is God who teaches us how to worship.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.720]   It is God who appoints the high priest.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   Not men.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.320]   They may be very able, clever men like Horadeth and Abiram.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.520]   Doesn't matter.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.320]   It is God who is to be worshipped and he tells us how.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.960]   And we mustn't deviate from the teaching.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:54.720]   So we mustn't be deluded by these appeals to beauty and so on and order and arrangement.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   No, no.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.320]   It's a matter of spirit and of truth.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.920]   And God has instructed us and his son has instructed us.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.260]   You see him here.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.000]   You see him worshipping God.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.340]   Of course, his whole life was lived for God.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.360]   But you find that he arose a great while before dawn and went up onto a mountain to pray.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.440]   He'd go apart from the people in order that he might have quiet and silence and pray and
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.960]   adore and worship God.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.560]   Our Lord constantly did this.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.100]   And he teaches us how to do the same thing.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.080]   So I say we need the instructions that our Lord gave to the woman of Samaria at this
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   point.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.840]   "You don't know what you worship.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.400]   We know what we worship.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.800]   For salvation is of the Jews.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:45.680]   We must look to him and listen to him and be led by him and by him alone."
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.400]   The moment we deviate from that, we've already gone astray.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.040]   Well, now, there are the main matters taught here, and I'm confining myself to this record
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   only.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.800]   There are the main ideas with regard to worship.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.600]   What about the true ideas of God?
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.080]   You see, you can't separate these two.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.800]   They go together.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.200]   As we think of God, so we will worship.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.760]   So our Lord gives this woman instruction also with regard to God.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.560]   He says, "You don't know.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.480]   You think you're worshipping God.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.880]   You're not.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.280]   You're worshipping something created by your forefathers."
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:31.120]   And oh, what a terrible thing it is to realize how often we've been guilty of the same thing.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.880]   Do we know whom we worship?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.240]   Who is our God?
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   What is our God?
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.400]   Have you faced this question?
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.320]   You see, you can go through life dropping down on your knees, saying your prayers, without
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:51.080]   ever having thought of whom you were worshipping and to whom you were praying.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.400]   There's nothing more vital than this.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.120]   For our ideas of God, as we saw last Sunday morning, are so wrong, they're so false.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.320]   We confine them to buildings.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:07.620]   We think of him as mere force, mere power, the ground of all being, and all that the
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.040]   modern philosophers, even in Christian pulpits, are teaching about God.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.200]   It's such an utter travesty.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.880]   That's why the church is as she is.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.480]   No, no, we've got to take our teaching from the Lord himself, and here it is.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:30.200]   The authorized translation, "God is a spirit," but the better translation is, "God is spirit."
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.480]   You see, the contrast between this localizing, this mountain, Jerusalem, particular buildings.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.800]   No, no, says our Lord, get rid of that.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:46.240]   God is spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:53.640]   Now, this, you see, was something that the early Christians, the apostles and other teachers,
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.200]   had a great fight about, even with the Jews.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.800]   The Jews had gone astray on this matter.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   Take, for instance, the martyr Stephen.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.120]   This is how Stephen puts it.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.520]   The record is in his great address to the Sanhedrin in the seventh chapter of the book
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.120]   Let me read to you from verse 47 onwards.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.720]   But Solomon built him a house.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.360]   How be it?
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:24.760]   The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hens, as saith the prophet.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.840]   Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.200]   What house will ye build me, saith the Lord?
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.440]   Or what is the place of my rest?
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.960]   Hath not my hand made all these things?
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:43.240]   God, you see, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hens.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.080]   And Paul has to say exactly the same thing when he arrives in Athens.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.280]   Here they are with their temples all over the place.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.200]   He says, I see you are too religious, too superstitious, says this translation.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.840]   It means too religious, worshipping these various gods.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.160]   And so the apostle puts it to them in these words.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.360]   He says, As I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.920]   the unknown God.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:16.760]   Then exactly like our Lord to the woman of Samaria, whom therefore you ignorantly worship,
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.000]   Him declare I unto you.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.480]   He's the apostle, he's sent, the sent apostle, given the revelation, given the message, he
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   declares.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.440]   He doesn't argue, he doesn't philosophise, he declares.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.920]   And he's had experience of this living God through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.360]   Whom therefore you ignorantly worship.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   And oh, beloved people, let's examine ourselves.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.560]   Are we worshipping ignorantly, or do we know the God whom we worship?
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.920]   Him declare I unto you.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.320]   And then he goes on and puts it like this.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:57.760]   God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.600]   dwelleth not in temples made with hens.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.920]   Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he giveth
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.520]   to all life and breath and all things, etc.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.400]   Well now there is the great principle.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   God is spirit.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.440]   God is the living God.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:28.160]   He saw unlike the pagan gods, they made their gods out of gold and silver and wood, and
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.760]   they had to carry their gods and put them on pedestals and bow down and worship.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   But they were doing everything, their gods were dead.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.040]   As the psalmist ridicules it in various places, they have eyes, your gods have eyes, but they
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   see not.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   Ears have them, but they cannot speak.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.480]   Feet have them, but they cannot move.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.920]   You have to carry your gods about, but that's not God, the living God.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.240]   God is spirit.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.800]   And he is one who is only present.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.720]   You can't confine God to this mountain or to Jerusalem.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.720]   Why?
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.960]   Well because God is everywhere.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.480]   Listen to the psalmist putting this in his own way in this glorious manner that the psalmist
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   do these things.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.800]   Let me read to you some of these verses from Psalm 139.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:25.440]   Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   there.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.960]   If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.800]   shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.840]   If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me," even the night shall be light about me.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.360]   Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:57.440]   The darkness and the light are both alike to thee, for thou hast possessed my reins.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.640]   Now here is what our Lord is teaching God.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.200]   He is spirit and he is everywhere.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.560]   He is taking his head from his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.760]   of him with whom we have to do.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.440]   Oh, my language is inadequate.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.400]   Even the Bible is inadequate.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.560]   It can only give us glimpses and pictures of the glory of God, filling the universe.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:30.000]   The universe he made is over all, reigning and ruling over all.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.120]   Our God is a consuming fire.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:42.400]   God is spirit, and his might and his power are illimitable.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.360]   He is the living God, the Father of all spirits.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.840]   God is spirit.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.040]   God is.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.120]   Everything else has come into being and into existence only as the result of his great
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.600]   and holy will and the work of his power.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.920]   But you know we must not stop at that.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.000]   If we left it at that, we would all be filled with terror and alarm.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   God is spirit.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.400]   God conceived of it.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.320]   But thank God our Lord went on to say something further to this woman.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:28.800]   God is spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.840]   But do not forget that he also said this.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:42.560]   The hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   truth.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.400]   For the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.000]   And this of course is the special revelation that has come through our blessed Lord and
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.480]   Savior.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:00.200]   In the Old Testament you get the prophets almost getting there to this idea, "As a
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.880]   father pitieth his children."
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.320]   But they don't get any further.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:10.640]   It is only with our Lord that you get the fullness of this teaching concerning God as
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   our Father.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.440]   God is spirit, but we can't conceive of that.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.080]   But when I'm told that God is Father, I know that that eternal spirit is personal.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   Personal.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:30.040]   You've read these notorious books that have come out in the last few years that are
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   militating against the idea that God is personal.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.320]   That's why they don't pray of course, and that's why they know nothing about worship.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:44.160]   God to them is some abstraction, some philosophic X, some absolute, but God isn't.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.280]   God is spirit and not localized, but God is Father.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   He is personal.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.760]   A father is personal.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.320]   Our Lord taught us to pray, didn't he?
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.400]   He didn't tell us to pray to, "O eternal spirit."
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   No, no.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.800]   Our Father.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.360]   But lest we go astray because we use the word Father, which art in heaven.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.260]   You see, there are two errors here always.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:15.320]   We banish God into some infinite distance and we have no communion with him.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.640]   Or, on the other hand, we become too familiar with him.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.880]   But our Lord, you see, has put it perfectly.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.960]   Our Father, yes, but which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:33.680]   There is the perfect balance that is ever the characteristic of his teaching.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:40.600]   You remember again he said, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.120]   Think of me, he says, when you pray to God.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.680]   The Father is like me.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.960]   "Whosoever hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.440]   Then there is that beautiful phrase of the Apostle Paul, which ought to thrill our hearts
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   to the depths.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:00.600]   He talks about the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.880]   That's the idea of fatherhood.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.960]   The Father and the Son are like one another.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   And we have the glimpses of Jesus and, "Ah, that's the Father.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.480]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   What does this mean?
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.000]   Well, this is the wonderful thing.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.760]   This is a part of this great offer of life, which is life indeed, eternal life.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.080]   We are not merely forgiven, I say, but we've been adopted into the family of God.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.320]   We have received the adoption of sons.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.760]   And so we must ever remember that this great God, the Father of all spirits, God who is
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:43.920]   spirit, the everlasting creator, the God of glory, is one who, according to the counsel
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:50.760]   of his own will, and it baffles us and amazes us, has set his heart and his love upon us.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.600]   And before the very foundation and creation of the world, he knew you and he has chosen
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.520]   you and he's called you out of darkness into light.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   Why?
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.680]   Well, that you might receive the adoption of sons.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.200]   You're not merely forgiven, you're adopted into the family of heaven.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   You're a child.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.680]   You're a son of God.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.560]   And he's concerned about you and he knows all about you.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.880]   That hymn we sang at the beginning puts it so well.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:26.440]   Center and soul of every sphere, yet to each loving heart.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.440]   How near.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.600]   Do you realize that when you pray or when you worship?
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.920]   You see, before you begin to utter a sound, realize who God is.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.200]   Check this principle of recollection.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:45.800]   You must stop, you must think what you're doing, and then you remember who God is.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Center and soul of every sphere.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.480]   And you feel I can't do anything.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.240]   Then you remember, yet to each loving heart.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.520]   How near.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.080]   The very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.980]   We should never go into the presence of God without remembering all this rich teaching
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.400]   that is given here to us.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.680]   Let me give you one more before I close.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.280]   It's in the sixth chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.760]   Where again this matter is being dealt with.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.080]   Wherefore, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.400]   But before that even, what agreement of the temple of God with idols?
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.640]   For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.280]   I will dwell in them and I'll walk in them and I will be their God.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.120]   And they shall be my people.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.520]   Wherefore, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.400]   Doesn't matter how small the number is.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.840]   Come out from among them.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   Be ye separate.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:55.000]   Touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.920]   And you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.880]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews caps it all in the eleventh chapter in the sixteenth
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:18.160]   verse and he says, "Wherefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God."
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.040]   The personal, the father, the one who loves you with an everlasting love, the one who
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.720]   is interested in you.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:31.840]   And Peter ends it all by saying, "Casting all your care upon him."
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.960]   Who?
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.440]   The Spirit, the eternal Spirit, the Father of spirits, the Father of lights, with whom
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.880]   is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.480]   Yes, that's all true of him.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.360]   But you can't cast your cares.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.760]   You've come into this service overwhelmed with grief or sorrow or shame or disappointment.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.160]   Life has been harsh and cruel.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.960]   The devil has tempted you and you're full of cares and anxiety.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.280]   You've come in burden.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:12.400]   Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:24.840]   God is spirit, but God is my Father in and through my blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.680]   These my dear friends are the preliminaries to worship.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.440]   And until we are right about these things, we shall know very little about the well of
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:39.040]   water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.520]   God grant that this particular hindrance, wrong ideas about worship, wrong ideas about
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:50.000]   God in the light of the teaching we've seen may have been removed.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.440]   And we now shall realize the presence of God and know something about that experience that
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.120]   those men had in Fetter Lane.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:08.560]   We praise, we worship thee, O God.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.440]   Amen.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
