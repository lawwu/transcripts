[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   One of the biggest problems I see that happens when people write really boring stuff,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.100]   especially within the context of a company, is they're writing with like a big committee.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.180]   So someone's like, well, what about this? What about this? And then you get this like weird
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.340]   congealed idea where instead I'm like, okay, pause. What are we sending this in? And they're
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.840]   like, this is going to be at the top of our newsletter for a company for all of our employees
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.820]   to read. I'm like, okay, so let's keep it just two, three paragraphs at most. Let's try to include
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.040]   an image that's interesting and let's try to make it something that can help them. And then it could
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.560]   be something about like, here's how to get the most out of your 401k with XYZ company. Here's how to get
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.680]   the best healthcare from XYZ company. Here's the wins that we had at XYZ company that you can tell
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.980]   your family that we did. And what happens is we start spitballing ideas and everyone goes like,
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.840]   oh, I know that that one's really interesting. Everyone asks about that all the time. Then I'm
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.060]   like, that's the concept that we're going to go after, right?
