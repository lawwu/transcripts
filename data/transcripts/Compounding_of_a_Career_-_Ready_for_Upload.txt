[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.440]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Josh Rascheitz. I'm your host.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.120]   This is a special edition of the show. This show was pre-recorded so that it would be here for you
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   while I am traveling during the last two weeks of September. I hope you enjoy it. If this is your
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.720]   first time listening to the show, please feel free to check out the archives from prior to September 15
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.480]   to see the more normal ebb and flow of the show or feel free to check back after October. But I do
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   hope you enjoy this content today. Today I want to share with you briefly an article that I read
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.240]   and just have some food for thought about the value of the compounding nature of everything.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.240]   And this is a subject that I want to explore in detail in future shows. Today I'm just going to
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.560]   share with you one example because it really made me think and I really enjoyed this article that
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.240]   I'm going to read to you. I want to give a hat tip to James Clear, who was the writer who first
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.640]   turned me on to this article. He wrote an article called "How to Read More," the simple system I'm
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.640]   using to read 30 plus books per year. If you're interested in reading his article, it's at
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.080]   jamesclear.com/read-more. But the introduction to his book, excuse me, to his article, had these
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.360]   three paragraphs in it. "Warren Buffett, the man commonly referred to as the greatest investor of
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800]   the 20th century, was standing in front of 165 wide-eyed students from Columbia University.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.000]   One of the students raised his hand and asked Buffett for his thoughts on the best way to
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   prepare for an investing career. After thinking for a moment, Buffett pulled out a stack of papers
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.280]   and trade reports he had brought with him and said, 'Read 500 pages like this every day. That's
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.880]   how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.040]   not many of you will do it.' Buffett estimates that 80 percent of his working hours are spent
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.800]   reading or thinking. It's enough to make you ask, 'Am I reading enough books?'" And James's
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.360]   article goes on from there. Well, I followed the link through, and I'm going to read to you the
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.640]   article that this came from, because this is a really interesting story, and it comes from the
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   Omaha newspaper found at omaha.com, and the title of the article is called "Investors Earn Handsome
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   Paychecks by Handling Buffett's Business." Before I read the article, though, I want to just simply
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.440]   emphasize to you the point that Buffett made, is that knowledge is like compound interest. It works
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.080]   like compound interest, except I believe it probably is far easier to get going for you than
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   compound interest. I think a lot about compounding, because I notice that many things compound.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   If you plant—I'm getting ready to plant some new avocado trees on my property—and
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   if you plant an avocado tree, that avocado tree will produce avocados for you for the rest of
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.920]   your life, or an apple tree, or whatever it is in your climate. I don't know where you live.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   But it compounds. Flowers compound on a rose bush. Knowledge compounds over time.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.480]   But you've got to get it started working for you. So just consider, is there a way that you can get
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   things compounding for you in every area of life? I'm not prepared enough today to go into more
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.800]   details on that subject, but I do want you to just consider it and think about it, because I really
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   feel that's a helpful concept to apply to life and simply say, "What can I compound?" I'm going to
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.200]   read to you this news article. And I'm doing it because oftentimes if you're listening to a podcast,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.240]   you're probably listening in a context where it's difficult for you to read. So instead of just
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.560]   saying, "Go read the article," I'm actually going to read it to you. But listen to the path of
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.280]   knowledge and consider the lessons that you can learn about good investment, good investment
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   strategies, and actually what serious investors are like. They're kind of freaks of nature.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   And that said in a very admiring way. This article again is entitled, "Investors Earn
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.600]   Handsome Paychecks by Handling Buffett's Business," by Steve Jordan, World Herald staff writer.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.160]   Warren Buffett's decision to hire two investment lieutenants is paying off for Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.240]   and it's paying off for the two younger money managers too. Todd Combs, 42, and Ted Weschler,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.880]   51, are expected to receive bonuses exceeding $50 million each based on their investment results in
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.360]   2012, evidence that they and Buffett made the right choices when they connected. Notice that
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.280]   they are receiving bonuses in excess of $50 million each. Now, how did they get there?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.800]   Listen to how. Weschler and Combs had admired Buffett long before meeting him,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.320]   and both actively sought connections that led to their hiring.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   Both actively sought connections that led to their hiring. Also, in an interview for the book,
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.920]   Buffett said hiring Combs and Weschler happened because of, quote, "a lot of good luck." Quote,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   "Like Woody Allen said, 95% of it is just showing up," he said. "That's what happened with Berkshire.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.680]   That's what happened with the people. And once you get them, you've got them for decades to come.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   And people do want to join us." Buffett hired Combs in 2010 and Weschler in 2011 as part of
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.800]   Berkshire's succession plan, which calls for splitting his job into three parts, a non-executive
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.320]   chairman, a CEO to handle acquisitions and the care of executives who run Berkshire-owned businesses,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   and a small group to invest Berkshire's money. Today, Combs and Weschler each manage about $5
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.640]   billion out of Berkshire Hathaway's $88 billion in investments. Their pay package is no surprise.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.040]   Both were high-income investment managers on their own before joining Berkshire. Buffett has said
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.640]   they would be paid salaries of about 0.1% of the money they manage, which would be $5 million a
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   year based on a $5 billion portfolio. They also receive, quote, "performance pay" of 10% of the
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.920]   amount their investments grow beyond gains by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 publicly traded
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   stocks averaged over several years. In his latest report to shareholders, Buffett said investments
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   by Weschler and Combs in 2012 were more than 10 percentage points higher than the 16% returns by
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.000]   the S&P 500. "They left me in the dust as well," Buffett wrote. If each managed $5 billion and had
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.360]   26% returns, their performance pay would be $50 million, with one-third paid in 2013, one-third
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   in 2014, and one-third in 2015. Part of their pay also depends on the other's investing success.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.480]   That kind of compensation wasn't on Combs' radar when he first saw Buffett in person.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.960]   He was among 165 students in a Columbia University investing class.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   Combs didn't meet Buffett that day, but says, "I still remember it like it was yesterday."
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.520]   One of the students asked what he could do now to prepare for an investing career.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.600]   Buffett thought for a few seconds and then reached for the stack of reports,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240]   trade publications, and other papers he had brought with him.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.400]   "Read 500 pages like this every day," said Buffett, or words to that effect. "That's how
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:41.040]   knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.200]   not many of you will do it." Remarkably, Combs began doing just that, keeping track of how many
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.800]   pages and what he read each day. Eventually, finding and reading productive material became
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.440]   second nature, a habit. As he began his investing career, he would read even more, hitting 600,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.520]   750, even 1,000 pages a day. Combs discovered that Buffett's formula worked, giving him more
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.720]   knowledge that helped him with what became his primary job, seeking the truth about potential
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.000]   investments. After graduating, Combs worked as a bank regulator and in the pricing department
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.960]   of Progressive Insurance, and five years later, he began running Castle Point Capital,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.120]   a private investment fund in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he lived. His road to
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.360]   Omaha began when he met a money manager from Australia who was going to California to see
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire and a confidant of Buffett's. Combs remembers thinking,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.720]   "I'd like to meet Charlie someday." Not long afterward, Combs was headed to California and
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.120]   called Munger's office, figuring it was pretty unlikely that he would get to see Munger.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.440]   To his surprise, Munger offered to meet him at the California Club for breakfast.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   I'm going to interrupt for a moment. Notice that successful people, quote-unquote,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.720]   are often much more available than you might think. "I was terrified," Combs said. He had
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.520]   attended two of Berkshire's annual shareholder meetings in Omaha and knew that Munger often gave
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:14.560]   blunt assessments of people and businesses. "But we really hit it off," Combs said.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.080]   "He was the most warm, gentle man." The two talked for hours and Munger offered to get together
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.520]   again. Combs quickly arranged to return to California. Eventually, Munger told him,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.480]   "I really think Warren would like to meet you." Combs, of course, needed no persuasion,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.720]   and in the fall of 2010 he was invited to Buffett's office. He arrived at 10 a.m., met people and
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.440]   talked, went with Buffett for a two-hour lunch at Piccolo's Restaurant, and returned to the office.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.880]   "We just talked and talked and talked," Combs said. "I'll never forget it. It doesn't take
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.000]   a rocket scientist to know you've met someone very special. It's really hard to describe."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.240]   Eventually, Buffett began talking about his plan to hire a money manager. Combs—this is true,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.160]   he insists—started thinking about another person he could recommend, but Buffett had another idea.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.440]   He said, "Well, I think we're kind of thinking of you."
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   "Flabbergasted would be an understatement," Combs said. As the stunned Combs listened,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.200]   Buffett talked about compensation and suggested they both think about the offer.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   Combs returned home and talked with his wife, April, about the job and Omaha,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.840]   then accepted Buffett's offer. By then, Ted Weschler had already met Warren Buffett,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.560]   although the two had not talked about a job. With his own record of success in hand,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.600]   Weschler pursued the idea of working for Buffett, in the process donating $5,252,722
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:47.040]   to one of Buffett's favorite charities. Richard J. Weschler—Ted is his nickname—didn't expect to be
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.840]   working for an Omaha company when he came to town several years ago to attend an annual meeting of
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.960]   Berkshire's shareholders. On that visit, he blended in with thousands of others who had come to hear
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.800]   Buffett. The Buffalo, New York native first heard about Buffett's investing style in 1979,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.200]   when he was at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, the same college
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.800]   Buffett attended for two years before graduating from the University of Nebraska. A friend
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.760]   introduced Weschler to Buffett's writings. "From then on, I kept my eye open for anything that had
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.120]   to do with him. It was on my list that at some point I wanted to meet the guy. He had such an
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   impact on my life from afar. He really is very generous in teaching others things that he learned
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.000]   through living his life." After college, Weschler worked for W.R. Grace Company, a Maryland chemical
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.720]   company. He handled investments in New York City for six years before he and a colleague set up a
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.120]   private equity firm, Quad C Management Inc., in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1989. "The move out
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   of the city was for a reason," he said. "That was one of the real takeaways for me in all of the
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.720]   reading that I did over the years about Warren, how important it was to stay away from the noise."
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.760]   In 2000, Weschler formed his own investment fund, Peninsula Capital Advisors, LLC, managed from
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.600]   Charlottesville with a researcher and an assistant. "It was really more of a library. We really kept
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.880]   outside noise out of the place. I certainly shaped Peninsula based on what Warren had done with
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.240]   Berkshire." For example, he didn't employ a stock trader, figuring that a trader would have an
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.680]   incentive to buy and sell stocks rather than help make longer-range decisions. The fund, with about
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.480]   60 investors, turned out Buffett-like results. An investor who put $100 into the Peninsula fund when
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.400]   it opened on January 14, 2000, would have been left with a stock portfolio worth $1,134.66
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:47.680]   when it closed on December 9, 2011. During that same period, the Standard & Poor's index of 500
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:56.000]   stocks gained 6.72%, meaning Weschler's investors did 153 times better than the overall stock market.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.720]   At some point, an annual online auction caught Weschler's eye. Since 1993, Buffett had been
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.200]   raising money for the Glide Foundation, an anti-poverty group in San Francisco,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.560]   by having lunch with the highest bidders. Weschler already was giving money to charities,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.960]   including the Charlottesville Free Clinic, the University of Virginia's Children's Hospital
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.720]   Building Fund, the Building Goodness Foundation, Children, Youth, and Family Services, and St. Ann's
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.640]   Bellfield School in Charlottesville. Three years ago, Weschler's business took him to San Francisco,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.520]   and he made an appointment to see Glide first-hand. "I wanted to know more," he said.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.600]   "They were terrific. They invited me in, and I ended up spending half a day at Glide. I met Glide
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.200]   pastor Cecil Williams. I was just blown away by how thoughtfully and how carefully Glide really
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.080]   helps the otherwise hopeless. That gave me the comfort that this was not only an opportunity to
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.600]   potentially visit with Warren, but also in many ways more significantly to help out a really
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.880]   worthwhile charity." Armed with confidence in Glide's work and a checkbook built up by his
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:10.720]   investment success, Weschler's bid of $2,626,311 won the 2010 auction. At his request, Glide and
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   Buffett kept his name secret. "After I won, Warren called," Weschler said. "He was happy to come to
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.800]   Charlottesville or to meet at a widely known steakhouse in New York City that would donate
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.080]   a luncheon for eight. I suggested, 'No, actually, it would be better for me if it would work for me
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.360]   to come out to Omaha, see the office, and instead of lunch, make it dinner.' When we actually got
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.400]   together, the only condition was that we not do it in a public forum." Buffett readily agreed,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.560]   and two or three weeks later, Weschler came to Omaha for dinner at Piccolo's.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.400]   The two got along handily, Weschler said. It was very natural and conversational. He spent an hour
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   or more at the office, with Buffett introducing him to staff members and showing him some of the
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:15:02.800]   memorabilia on the walls. "I was interested in his story," Weschler said. "We've got similar
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.320]   backgrounds, both like business as kids, had done all sorts of active investing in companies.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.040]   I wanted to see his environment. People's environments are very telling to me, to come
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.280]   back to his workplace and see how he functions." In 2011, he won the auction again and came to
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.360]   Omaha a second time for dinner. After that, Buffett offered him the job, and Weschler accepted.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Have you ever thought about buying a job for yourself? Interesting, huh? Soon after,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.240]   Weschler was at a horse show where one of his two daughters was competing when a neighbor asked,
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.760]   "Are you the Ted Weschler who was just hired by Warren Buffett?" "That's me," Weschler answered.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.320]   "Well," the neighbor said, "my mother-in-law is a good friend of Buffett's." Turns out she was
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.480]   talking about Dr. Carol Engel, a former Omahaan and widow of Dr. Bill Engel, one of Buffett's
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:58.240]   earliest investors and a pal who shared Buffett's love of model trains in the 1950s and who helped
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.480]   him recruit doctors as early investors. A remarkable coincidence, but it was no coincidence
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.440]   that Buffett and Weschler could work together. As a kid, Weschler was practically obsessed with
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.720]   sports, but before long he realized he could channel that obsession into numbers and money,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.760]   both subjects that also appealed to Buffett. "With Warren, it's terrific," Weschler said.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.920]   "It really is all about the people you work with. To be able to kick ideas around with
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.520]   somebody like Warren, that's pretty spectacular. I'm passionate about investing." If you're
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.800]   passionate about electrical engineering and that was what really motivated you and made you jump
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.160]   out of bed every morning and you had a chance to work alongside Thomas Edison, how could you say
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:47.840]   no to that? And that's the article. Hope you enjoyed that. I just saw so many lessons for success
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.960]   in that and such an interesting, interesting story. That's it for today, but consider today,
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.480]   how can you put compounding to work in your life?
