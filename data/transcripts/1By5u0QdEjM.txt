[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Why does God withhold good things from us, his children?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's a perennial question, it's older than Psalm 73 and it comes in today from an anonymous
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.920]   woman who lives in Brooklyn.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.160]   Pastor John, hello, I'm a 26-year-old Christian woman, been saved for 9 years and am single.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.080]   I know the Bible says that no good thing does God withhold from those who walk uprightly,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.700]   Psalm 84, 11, but I feel like God is withholding marriage from me.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.760]   How do I fight for joy and keep my desire for marriage in proper perspective as I wait?
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.120]   Well, since I wrote a whole book on how to fight for joy, even by that title, let me
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.080]   focus on the second part of this question, which I really think is the main thing.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.960]   How do I keep my desire for marriage as a single person who would like to be married?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.920]   How do I keep my desire for marriage in proper perspective?
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.960]   Because that will then turn around and answer the other part.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.840]   And here's my answer.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.360]   Number one, the desire for marriage is in proper perspective when it is a desire for
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.680]   marriage for Christ's sake.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.960]   Saint Augustine prayed, "He loves thee too little, O God, who loves anything together
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   with thee which he loves not for thy sake."
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.040]   He knew from the Bible that it is not wrong to desire food or drink or clothes or friend
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.400]   or knowledge or health or safety or marriage.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's not wrong to desire that.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.080]   And he wrestled with the question, "When do these legitimate desires become sin?"
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.200]   And his answer was, "When they're not for Christ's sake."
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.320]   And that may sound, I know the kind of person who would say, "That sounds ridiculously
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960]   hyper-spiritual to me."
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   Right.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.120]   I want pizza for Christ's sake.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.440]   I want a glass of water for Christ's sake.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400]   I want sex for Christ's sake.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.720]   I want a friend for Christ's sake, blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   So, all you hyper-spiritual people.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.960]   If you think Augustine sounds hyper-spiritual because you're supposed to do everything for
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.920]   God's sake, you're not criticizing me or Augustine.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.280]   You're criticizing God and the Bible.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.200]   Because it was the inspired apostle, not Augustine, who said, "Whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus."
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.200]   Desire pizza in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.440]   Desire a glass of water in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.280]   Desire sex in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.200]   Desire marriage in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.160]   Or he says it this way in 1 Corinthians 10.31, "Whether you eat or drink or whatever you
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.920]   do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.720]   So my first answer is the desire for marriage is in proper perspective when it is a desire
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.200]   for marriage for Christ's sake.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.400]   Number two, the desire for marriage is in proper perspective when it is a desire of
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.440]   faith, a desire carried and shaped and sustained by faith.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   The Bible says we're to walk by faith, 2 Corinthians 5.7.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.080]   Live by faith, Galatians 2.20.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.320]   Obey by faith, Hebrews 11.8.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.960]   Which I take to include all the acts of the heart and the body, let it all be by faith,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.280]   because not to is to sin, Romans 14.23.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.040]   Whatever's not from faith is sin.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   So desiring marriage by faith would mean let the desire be embedded in the confidence that
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.640]   God did not spare his own Son but gave him up for you and will, according to this rock
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.720]   solid logic of Romans 8.32, will give you all things with him, all things that you need
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   to glorify him and to do his will, which is implied in the context because you might get
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.500]   killed in doing it.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.480]   And that's what I think Romans 8.28 means and Matthew 6.33 means and Psalm 84.11 means,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.280]   the Lord God is a sun and shield, the Lord bestows favor and honor.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.280]   Faith lays hold on God's promises and believes them, which keeps all of our desires in proper
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.560]   perspective.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.280]   Number three, the desire for marriage is in proper perspective when the sorrow of not
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.480]   having it does not sour into cynicism and bitterness.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.780]   I think sorrow at the loss of innocent desires is not sin, not unless the sorrow overwhelms
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.020]   godly joy and sours into cynicism and bitterness and drags a single person to isolation and
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.160]   sin rather than friendship and service.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.440]   Paul spoke of his many sorrows, Romans 9.2, 2 Corinthians 6.10.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.520]   It's not wrong to sorrow, but it is wrong not to rejoice and not to live for others
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.120]   and to become absorbed in cynicism and bitterness and self-pity.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.180]   Number four, the desire for marriage is in proper perspective when it does not diminish
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.540]   zeal to glorify God with the freedom of singleness.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.940]   Paul was just as vulnerable to loneliness as anyone.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.540]   He said in 1 Thessalonians 3.1, "When I could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   behind alone in Athens."
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540]   And we sent Timothy.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.300]   You can hear in that he hated to be alone.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.820]   He loved partnership.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   He loved friendship.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.700]   He loved people, needed people.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.780]   But he wished everyone could have the freedom of singleness for ministry that he had.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.860]   He knew that that wasn't God's will for everybody, but he does reveal the possibilities of singleness
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.760]   that he loved.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.300]   Number five, I've got two more.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:31.980]   The desire for marriage is in proper perspective when it is not intensified by unrealistic
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.700]   notions that marriage is the key to happiness.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.780]   In other words, it's not wrong to dream about the kinds of happiness a person may have in
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:50.500]   marriage, but don't let your desire intensify because you idealize marriage as heaven on
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.900]   earth.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:59.860]   Not only is marriage not heaven on earth, it's not even heaven in heaven because it
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.100]   won't be there.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.240]   In the resurrection, they are neither marrying nor giving in marriage, Matthew 22, 30.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.420]   So let your desire for marriage be tempered and kept in proper perspective by this.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:22.580]   Marriage is a temporary covenant, just as full of sorrows as singleness is, and pointing
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.940]   to a heavenly covenant, that single and married we enjoy.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:34.380]   And lastly, number six, the desire for marriage will be kept in proper perspective best when
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.260]   you're part of a loving Bible-preaching church.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.100]   That is a family that will last forever.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   Amen.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.100]   That's a great episode.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.980]   And this episode is number 1303 in the archive, which means we've surpassed 1300 total episodes
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.100]   in the history of this little podcast.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.100]   Incredible.

[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:13.100]   Well, speaking of brides and marriage and waiting, does Jesus celebrate polygamy in
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.220]   the parable of the ten virgins?
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.320]   They all seem to be waiting for the groom and there's no mention of a bride.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.500]   Are all ten the brides themselves?
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.780]   It's an interesting Bible question.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.780]   Next up on Friday.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.260]   We'll see you then.
