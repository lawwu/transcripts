[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   There's going to be a mixture of tax hikes and slower spending
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.820]   growth, especially hurting the poor.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.840]   And that's how the U S is going to close its fiscal gap.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.400]   I don't know particularly what paths other countries are going to go through,
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.020]   but the U S has this basically this one tool, this one superpower sitting, sitting
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.280]   in the room that it hasn't used yet.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.480]   And it's, oh, it's a VAT, right?
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.080]   So the U S could dramatically increase its tax revenue through either an
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.680]   overt or disguised value added tax.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.340]   And that would raise a ton of money, just like it raises in Europe.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.360]   And that would, that's the easy way to close the U S fiscal gap.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.640]   We probably won't even have to get to that.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.180]   Just making Medicaid worse slowly over the long run, maybe making
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.820]   Medicare worse over the long run.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.120]   That by itself would close a lot of this fiscal gap.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.220]   So basically I think they'll balance the long run budget on the kind of the
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.840]   backs of the poor and the middle-class.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.780]   That's probably the most likely outcome.
