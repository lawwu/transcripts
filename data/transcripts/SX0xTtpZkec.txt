[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I should like to call your attention this evening to that incident in the life of King
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   Jehoiakim of Judah, the account of which we read at the beginning in the book of the Prophet
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.320]   Jeremiah, chapter 36.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.480]   And perhaps taking again verses 2 and 3 in particular, take the role of a book and write
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.560]   therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel and against Judah and
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.040]   against all the nations from the day I speak unto thee from the days of Josiah even unto
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   this day.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.920]   It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I propose to do unto them,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.000]   that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   their sin.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.760]   But, of course, I want to take with you the entire incident as you observed from the reading
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   at the beginning.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.840]   It is a whole and a unit in and of itself.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.920]   Now I am calling attention to this incident in order that we may continue what we have
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.600]   been doing now for a number of Sunday evenings.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.280]   And what we have been doing is to consider how one is to live in a world such as this.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.680]   We are trying to consider together why the world is as it is and what we can do about
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   it.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.960]   That is our controlling theme.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.360]   That is always the theme of the Bible.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.040]   The Bible is a book about life and about living.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.840]   It is the most practical book in the world.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.880]   It is not something remote.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.080]   It is not just a story.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.960]   This is a very practical book about life, daily life and living.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.520]   Now then, we are considering this, I say, and we have already been looking at various
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.280]   ways in which people are confronting the situation that faces them at this present hour.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:26.320]   This day of crisis, this day of calamity, this day which is so pregnant with terrible
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   possibilities.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.160]   Some, we have seen, are just refusing to look at it at all.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.280]   They are just contracting out of it, turning their backs on it, having their good time,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.440]   just going off and imagining that somehow everything is going to be all right.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.400]   Well, we saw the futility of that.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   But then last Sunday night we were looking at those who, while they would denounce that
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   utterly futile way of those people, are themselves in equal error because here are people who
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360]   are trying to solve the problem themselves by doing this or that or the other, putting
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.560]   their confidence in their own wisdom, in their own might and strength, in their money, in
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680]   their wealth.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.320]   We saw again the utter futility to which that leads also.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Anything that man relies on will certainly fail him.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.120]   The Bible is full of that kind of story.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.400]   These children of Israel were always relying on these other things.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.160]   They often relied on Egypt and other countries.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   It never paid them.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   It always brought them disaster.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.040]   Whatever it is that we rely on will certainly let us down, sooner or later.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.920]   When you come up against the ultimate, we saw that none of the things that we have as
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.800]   human beings in and of ourselves can possibly save us.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:07.440]   But now here is the extraordinary thing, that while mankind in this way has spent the centuries
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.840]   in trying this and turning to that, and adopting this expedient and then putting its hope in
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.000]   that one, always to fail, while all this has been going on, here confronting the human
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.640]   race has been this word of God, with its pronouncement upon the whole problem, its indication of
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.760]   the one and only way of escape.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   Now this is the thing, that throughout the centuries this message has been there, confronting
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:54.520]   mankind, showing it the cause of its ills, showing it the way of escape.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.440]   It's been there the whole time.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.880]   But this is the question.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.480]   What has been mankind's reaction to it?
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.440]   What has been mankind's response to it?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.560]   Throughout the running centuries this word has been there.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.360]   It's an old book, the oldest book in the world.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.720]   There it's been, facing the human race.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.960]   But here's the question.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   What have they done about it?
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200]   What's been their response to it?
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.040]   Come, let's be quite up-to-date and modern with the world as it is tonight.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   Here is this book, still facing us, with still the same old message.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.280]   So I put it in modern terms and I ask, what is the response, what is the reaction of the
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.600]   world tonight, in its dire predicament, to this message of the word of God?
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.520]   Well, no, it is because this chapter deals with that very question, that very matter,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.200]   that I am directing your attention to it.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.680]   Because I'm afraid it's but too obvious, isn't it, that the response and the reaction of
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   men and women today to the word of God is precisely that which is described in this
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.120]   very chapter.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.560]   Now let's look at it.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.680]   Let's look back at a piece of history.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.640]   To see this modern attitude typified and represented so perfectly, and let's see what that attitude
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   led to.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   It's a great advantage to be able to look back at history and to see how certain theories
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.880]   and ideas, when they are put into practice, how they rarely work out.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.560]   Here is a case in point.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   Let's look back.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   What do we find?
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.480]   Well, here's the story.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:01.040]   Jeremiah was the last of a long succession of prophets, men whom God had raised up to
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.560]   address in particular his own people, the children of Israel.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.760]   The message wasn't confined to them.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.400]   There was a message often to other nations as well.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.520]   Now Jeremiah, I say, was the last of this long succession.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   God had been speaking to his people for a number of years.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.360]   But now here comes the very last in this great series.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   In other words, Jeremiah was addressing the children of Israel at a point of very great
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.600]   and serious crisis.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.080]   A very powerful nation had arisen, the Chaldeans, the Babylonians.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.400]   They were conquering everybody.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.920]   They had got a great army, and they were threatening to come to attack and to destroy Israel, to
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.200]   capture the country, take away the people as slaves, and use them in their slave market.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.160]   That was the position.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.920]   In other words, the whole state and condition of Israel had never been so desperate, so
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.760]   hopeless as it was just at this time when Jeremiah was speaking.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.000]   They rarely were facing the end.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.640]   They were facing nothing short of calamity.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:31.720]   Now it was in those very circumstances that Jeremiah was sent to address this nation.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.560]   And he came with this message.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.440]   And he held it before.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.720]   By the time that we are dealing with in this story, he had been doing so for twenty-two
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.320]   years.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.280]   He pressed it upon them in every way that he could think of.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.680]   But here is the question.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   What was the response?
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.880]   Well, you remember the details that we are given in the story.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.520]   Jeremiah dictated this message that he had been delivering over the twenty-two years
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   to this scribe of his barrack.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.840]   The barrack went and read it to certain people, and they were frightened.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   They were alarmed.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   They said, "We must let the king know at once."
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.480]   So they went and they told the king about this.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.260]   And the king said, "I would rather like to see that row."
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.440]   So he sent one of his men to fetch the row.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.200]   And he came, and there was the king seated near a fire.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.040]   There was a fire on the hearth, and the king was seated there with the courtiers and the
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   princes.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.760]   And this man, Jehudai, begins to read out of this book, this scroll, containing the
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.660]   prophecy of Jeremiah.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:49.200]   But you remember what we are told, that after he had read two or three pages, the king said,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   "Let me have the row."
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   And he took his penknife and he cut off the pages, threw them into the fire, and burned
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   them.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.680]   "Go on," he said, "the men read a few more pages.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   Let me have the row."
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.600]   He cut them off again with his penknife, threw them into the fire, and it went on until he
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:14.320]   had destroyed and had burned completely the entire book, the whole message.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.160]   That was his reaction.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   Now I say it is because modern men are doing the same thing in a different way, that I
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.560]   am calling your attention to this incident.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.960]   Here I see a perfect portrayal of the modern world.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   I needn't waste your time in describing the circumstances.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.480]   We are on the edge of an abyss, there is no question about that.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:49.320]   The world has never been in such an alarming position as it is tonight.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   And here is this message still speaking to it and confronting it.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   But what is the response?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.640]   Very well, let us look at it together.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.520]   The first thing, obviously, therefore, that we have to do is to consider the message.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   What is the message?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:11.840]   What was the message that led this king, Jehia Kim, to cut it out and throw it into the fire
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.600]   and to burn it?
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.200]   What is this message that is confronting the world this evening?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.760]   Well fortunately for us, it is all summarized here more than once.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.320]   Here is the message that Jeremiah, I say, had been delivering now for twenty-two years.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   What is it?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.200]   Well, we are told in these first verses, "Take thee a roll of a book and write therein all
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.120]   the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.320]   the nations, from the days of Josiah even unto this day.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:53.560]   It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil that I purpose to do unto them,
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:01.040]   that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquities and
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   their sin."
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.440]   It is repeated in verse seven.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:11.680]   It may be they will present their supplications before the Lord and will return every one
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.600]   from his evil way.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.960]   For great is the anger and the fury of the Lord that the Lord hath pronounced against
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   this people.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.920]   What does all this mean?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.040]   Let me put it to you under a number of headings.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.440]   It is quite clear.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.760]   It is perfectly simple.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.600]   There is no difficulty at all about it.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.560]   This is God's message to this world this evening, first and foremost.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.000]   It is a message which condemns sin and iniquity.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.360]   That is the first thing about it.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.460]   This was the cause of all their trouble.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:59.680]   They were in their difficulties, they were threatened with this attack and this overwhelming
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:05.360]   disaster because of their sin and of their iniquity.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.800]   That is why it is a message which condemns them.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.720]   Here you see the children of Israel, the people of God.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   Why are they in this trouble?
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.160]   There is only one answer.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.080]   It was because of their sin, their iniquity.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   What does that mean?
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   Well, it is this.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.840]   It was because they had turned their backs upon God.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.080]   They had done so deliberately.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.920]   They had disobeyed God.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.760]   They were no longer living their lives according to his law and according to his rules and
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.220]   regulations.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.640]   They had deliberately turned away from that, brushed it aside, and were now living as they
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.320]   wanted to live and as they thought that life should be lived.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.880]   That is the meaning of sin and of iniquity.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.000]   It is disobedience of God.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.400]   It is rebellion against God.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.800]   It is the breaking of God's law.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.760]   It is the transgression of God's holy will and what he has told us about how life is
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   to be lived.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.320]   They had done that and they had done it quite deliberately.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.800]   And the message that God gives his servant to give to them is a message which condemns
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   them.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   It points out to them that it is all wrong, that there is nothing to be said for it, that
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.880]   it is an evil way of living in and of itself.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.020]   But it did not stop at that.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.860]   The message is not merely a condemnation for wrong living and disobedience of God and iniquity
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.520]   and sin.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   It is accompanied by a threat, a threat of punishment.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.600]   It tells us, "Great is the anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   this people."
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.160]   Take the role of a book and writer in all the words that I have spoken unto thee against
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.740]   Israel and against Judah and against all these nations.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:19.160]   It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.240]   Now, my dear friends, is this clear to us?
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.000]   I know we are living in an age which does not believe this, but I am not concerned about
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   that.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.920]   I am concerned to tell you what God's message is.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:39.120]   God not only condemns sin and tells us to stop sinning, God gives us the warning that
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.560]   if we do not, we shall be punished.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.920]   He has done that from the very beginning of history.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.720]   It is here in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.560]   Man was put in a place called paradise.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   He was told quite plainly, "As long as you go on living according to my law, you will
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.880]   stay here.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:05.400]   The moment you break that law, you shall be put out, and you will no longer go on living,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.920]   thus just taking the fruit and eating it.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.560]   The ground will be cursed.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.000]   You will earn your bread by the sweat of your brow.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   You will be in perpetual conflict with evil and sin and Satan."
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.040]   God told them all that.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.240]   He has always done so.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.000]   Now, you read this book from beginning to end, and you will find that this is invariable,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.520]   that God not only condemns evil ways, he announces that he is going to punish them, that there
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.680]   is always going to be retribution.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   This is something that is experienced partly in this life and in this world, but over and
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:54.880]   above that there is this great proclamation in the whole of the Bible that all men and
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:01.280]   women who have ever lived in this world will stand before God in a final judgment, and
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:08.800]   that all who have persisted in sin and iniquity and rebellion against God will be punished
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.080]   with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.240]   That is the message.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.400]   It was given here, it is given everywhere in the Bible.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   It is the message of the Christian Church.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:31.080]   God condemns sin, God threatens punishment for this sin and for this iniquity.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.840]   But thank God he does not stop at that.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:43.640]   He sends his messengers, these prophets, not merely to announce that there is to be punishment,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:51.560]   but to call men and women to repent, to see their error and their folly and to acknowledge
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.280]   it and to leave it and to return to God.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.160]   Did you notice these terms?
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   Listen to the Almighty God using such language.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   "It may be that the house of Israel will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.320]   them that they may return every man from his evil way."
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.000]   In other words, God sends the condemnation of sin and iniquity and the threat of this
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.840]   terrible punishment in order to call men and women back to himself, not merely to pronounce
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:30.240]   destruction but to save them, to get them to realize what they are doing and what they
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.560]   so richly deserve and what is coming to them, and while there is still time, to call them
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.000]   to repent.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   What does repent mean?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.120]   Well, repentance means what I have been saying.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.680]   It means you think again.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.600]   It means you change your mind.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   It means you say, "Well, I see I have been a fool.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.000]   I have been all wrong.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I have been foolish.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.360]   I have brought all this upon myself."
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.000]   And you turn to God and you confess it and acknowledge it and you ask him to have pity
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.960]   and compassion and mercy upon you, promising him that if he does, you will amend your ways,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.160]   you will turn right round, you will give yourself to him, you will live to his glory, you will
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.360]   live to keep his laws and to do all you can to be well-pleasing in his sight.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.200]   Repentance and a returning unto God.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.800]   That is why God raised these prophets.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.760]   He could have destroyed these people at the beginning, but he raised these prophets to
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:33.040]   plead with them, to enlighten them, to warn them, and to call upon them to come back and
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.280]   to return and to repent.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.680]   Now here it is in the Old Testament, but you see in the New Testament, isn't it much more
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.400]   obvious?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.560]   Even before the Son of God ever began his public ministry, you get the ministry of
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.440]   John the Baptist, the forerunner.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.200]   What was the message given to him?
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.760]   Well he preached, we are told, a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.480]   John's great message was repentance.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.440]   He warned the people, "Flee," he said, "from the wrath to come."
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.840]   He told them the position, he pleaded with them to repent, to renew their minds, to come
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.200]   back to God.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.800]   He says, "God is going to forgive you.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.640]   There is one coming after me who is going to bring the great salvation.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.920]   I am preparing the way for him."
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   Repentance.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.240]   It is a call back to repentance.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.280]   But you see, it doesn't even stop at that.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.160]   There is this gracious promise, "It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.080]   evil which I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:50.680]   that in order that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.960]   That's what God wants to do.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.960]   He wants to forgive.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   Go and speak to them.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.280]   Go and write in a book that it may be read to them, all these words that I've given to
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280]   you.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.160]   It may be that they'll see it, that they'll repent and come back, that I may forgive them.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.120]   You see, the condition of forgiveness is repentance, acknowledgement of sin, and a returning unto
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   the Lord.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.920]   Now that's the message.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.320]   It is the message of this gospel this evening.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.720]   As we stand on the brink of such terrible possibilities, as we are in the midst of life
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.240]   as it were, in death, here is the message of this gospel this evening.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Awaken.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.360]   Realize the position while there is still time.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   Repent.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.320]   Acknowledge your sin.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.560]   Confess it to God.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.480]   Come back.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.400]   Turn to him and he'll tell you that he's made a way of forgiveness in his only begotten
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.880]   Son, that he sent him into the world to die for sins, that we might be forgiven.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.080]   Believe on him and you are forgiven, that I may forgive them.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.200]   Here is the message.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.520]   It was the message then.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.000]   It is the message now.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.880]   Well, now, here's the question.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.680]   Let's see how this king reacted to that message.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   That's the message.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.120]   How did he react to it and his princes with him?
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.160]   I've already reminded you.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:27.120]   He took it and he cut it with his penknife and threw it into the fire that was burning
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.920]   on the hearth.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.520]   I say that men and women are still doing the same thing.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.520]   That doesn't mean that they're literally taking Bibles and tearing them up and throwing
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520]   them into the fire.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.100]   Some people even do that.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.640]   But my dear friend, you can do what this king did without doing that.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.160]   There are many ways of treating this message of God in exactly the same way as regards
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.000]   principle.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.040]   What it means is this, of course, that you utterly ignore it, that you pay no attention
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.680]   to it.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.320]   You destroy this message quite as much by ignoring it as you do by literally throwing
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.000]   it into a fire.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.320]   If you go on living exactly as you have been, taking no notice of this, you're in the
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.920]   same position as King Jehoiakim.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.200]   If you don't turn back to God and have your life controlled by him, you're in exactly
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.900]   the position of this man and his princes.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.800]   You notice the way he did it?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.560]   You notice the scorn?
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560]   You notice the contempt?
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:35.400]   "Give me that royal," he says, pulls out his penknife, cuts it off, throws it into
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   the fire.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.240]   That's what I think of that.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.400]   And you can see the jeering and hear the laughter of the princes and the courtiers.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.080]   They thought this was very clever.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.320]   He ridicules it, he spits upon it as it were, he hurls his contempt upon it, he laughs at
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:00.800]   it, he destroys it, he finishes it.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:09.520]   The question, my dear friend, is this, what's your reaction to this book?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.560]   Is your life based on this teaching?
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.960]   Is this the message that is controlling you and your whole outlook?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.720]   As you face life today and as you look to tomorrow and as you think of the possibilities
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.680]   that may be there, what's your life based upon?
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.840]   How are you facing it?
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.800]   This is how this man faced it.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.960]   This is how so many are facing it today.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.640]   They're laughing at this book.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.480]   They're ridiculing it, out of date, finished, rubbish.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.760]   They have no use for it.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.720]   They treat it blasphemously.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.900]   They say the great philosophers don't believe in it any longer.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.400]   And they follow these men, these men who write their books saying why they're not Christians
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   and so on.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   They have no use for the Bible.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.000]   They don't believe in it as the word of God.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.880]   And the masses of people are following them.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   They're not interested.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   They pay no attention.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.840]   They are virtually throwing it into the fire.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.000]   And they think they're clever in doing so.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.280]   It's done with scorn.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.520]   It's done with derision.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.040]   It's regarded as a book that's full of fairy tales, something that belongs to the primitive
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.840]   state of mankind.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.640]   We know so much better.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   We can judge it.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.840]   That's the attitude, the same old attitude of scorn and derision and unholy laughter
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:30.720]   that characterized this King Jehoiachim as he cuts it and throws it contemptuously into
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   the fire.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.080]   But no, this is what I'm concerned about.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.680]   Why do men react like that?
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.200]   Why did this King do that, you think?
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.640]   That's the question.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.480]   Because his reasons are still the same reasons.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.340]   I'm saying this every Sunday night for human race doesn't change at all.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.200]   This King Jehoiachim is a very modern man indeed.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.720]   He belongs to contemporary society.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.280]   His whole attitude to this is exactly the attitude, as I say, of the modern man.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   Why do they do it?
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   What are the reasons?
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.480]   Well, they're quite obvious.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.280]   One thing we can be quite clear about, it's got nothing whatsoever to do with intellect.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   Nothing at all.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   "Ah, but you see, that's a sweeping statement.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   Can you prove it?"
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.280]   Yes, I can, quite simply.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:32.520]   I've got two proofs which are adequate in and of themselves without deducing any others.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.680]   There's one reason.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.840]   The feeling that he displayed proves that it wasn't his intellect.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.080]   You see, you may read a book.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.720]   If you don't agree with it, you don't have necessity to throw it into the fire, do you?
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.640]   If you throw it into the fire, you show that there's feeling there.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.760]   You're governed by feeling, not by reason.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.920]   The man who's governed by reason and intellect and thought, he reads the book and he gives
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.200]   it a fair chance and he considers it and he says, "Well, yes, I see that case and it's
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   well presented and well argued, but I'm not convinced.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.880]   I'll put that on one side.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.120]   I'll put it on the shelf there in my library.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.560]   I'd like to have a look at it again sometime."
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.760]   Now that's how a reasonable man does, but King Jehoiachin didn't do that.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.680]   Pen knife, cut it up, throw it into the fire.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.320]   That's the modern man, isn't it?
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.360]   You see, there's too much feeling here for it to be intellect.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.560]   The man's governed by, I must call it, hatred.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   He hates the thing.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.800]   Well, a man who's guilty of hatred isn't the man who's being governed by reason.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.720]   He's not being governed by intellect and by thought.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.320]   No, no, there's something deeper.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.440]   There's passion here.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   There's contempt.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   There's hatred.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.080]   Now, you've already left the realm of intellect and understanding.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.360]   There's one argument, but I've got another.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:02.000]   It can't be a matter of intellect for this reason, that men of equal intellect and greater
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.640]   intellect than King Jehoiachin and his like believe it.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.240]   What about that?
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   If you could prove to me that the only people who've ever believed this message have been
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.480]   ignoramuses or fools, you'd be in a strong position.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.120]   But actually you're in this position that some of the greatest brains and minds the
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.440]   world has ever known have believed this, and still do.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.840]   Not only that, there are instances of men who once didn't believe it and then came
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   to believe it.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.440]   But they haven't gone mad.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.600]   They've got the same brain, same intellect, same everything.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.800]   You see, it's got nothing to do with intellect at all.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.840]   And the Bible always tells us that.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.280]   Man likes to think it's his knowledge, it's intellect, it's understanding.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.920]   It's got nothing to do with it.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.160]   It's nothing but this prejudice that leads to this contempt and hatred.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.080]   It's a moral problem, not an intellectual problem.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.440]   Well what was the cause of his doing this?
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.960]   What is the cause why men and women still do it?
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.360]   Well you know, it isn't intellect.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.040]   It's first of all, pride.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   Pride.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.680]   Pride of intellect.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.160]   And there's all the difference in the world between intellect and being proud of it.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.280]   Intellect's all right, but when a man's proud of it, he's all wrong.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.400]   Pride of intellect.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.320]   But it isn't only pride of intellect, it's pride in general.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.200]   What was the matter with this man, this king?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.600]   Well it was this, you see.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.560]   He disliked this idea of any superior authority.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.480]   He's a king.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.640]   He's not going to be dictated to.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.320]   He doesn't need any superior authority.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.560]   And he resents any suggestion that he does need it.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.720]   Now this is the essence of modern men's rejection of the Bible.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.280]   He says that he's been gifted with reason.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.080]   He doesn't want some authoritative book telling him how to live and what to do.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.600]   He knows that.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.440]   In other words, you see, the second reason, the second way in which this pride shows itself
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   is this.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.720]   That a man has got this supreme confidence in himself.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.000]   I don't want to go over this again.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.440]   I dealt with it last Sunday night.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.360]   He's confident in his wisdom, in his knowledge, in his understanding, in his ability to order
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.200]   his own life in the right way and to order his whole world in the right way.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.240]   And when he's confronted by a message which says, "Now listen to this," his reaction is,
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.600]   "I'm not going to listen to it.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.840]   Why should I listen to it?
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   I know.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   I'm capable."
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.720]   And of course the thing that pride is hurt still more, when the message comes to him
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:49.520]   and tells him quite plainly and in an unvarnished manner that all that he's been thinking and
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   doing is quite wrong, that he's a fool, that he's working against his own best interests
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.880]   and that he's put himself into this position of suffering which is going to lead to final
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   calamity.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.240]   That's the trouble about this book.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   It's a book that condemns us.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.920]   There is a book that comes to every one of us and says, "You've gone wrong.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.360]   You've gone astray.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.760]   You've been a fool.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.320]   You've brought your troubles upon yourself.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.920]   There's worse coming to you."
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.080]   The natural man, he resents it and he hates it.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.840]   The very suggestion that he's wrong, there's nothing he hates more.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.720]   But the message condemns us, condemns every one of us.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:44.680]   And this is the thing that man resents, that he's wrong, that he doesn't know what's
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:50.000]   best for him, that he can't succeed himself, that he refuses to believe this message that
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   he's helpless, that he's so helpless that he needs to be born again, that he needs a
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   new nature.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.760]   He says it's insulting, it's positively insulting to say that we as we are today,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.040]   that we can't do something, that we've got to become as little children.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.440]   He says he's out upon the suggestion.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.400]   It's his pride that's hurt.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.080]   But this is the message of the Bible.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.320]   It comes to us and tells us not only that we're all fools and all failures, it tells
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:21.520]   us that we are such fools and failures and are in such a state that we cannot put ourselves
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   right.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.400]   It needs the action of Almighty God to put us right.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   And we hate it.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.240]   Of course, they're ready to believe this message as long as it holds out a program
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   for them.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.600]   It's Christ and the Sermon on the Mount, an ethical program which we are going to carry
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   out.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.320]   But you see, that's a complete misinterpretation of the whole thing.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.560]   When it tells us we've got to become poor in spirit, which means that you admit you
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.920]   can do nothing, they don't like it.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   That's the cause of the trouble.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   Pride, hurt pride.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   This king resents it.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:01.680]   I'm not going to be condemned by this prophet, this man who's condemning me and my life
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.120]   and what I've done and said and who's threatening these things.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   It's impossible.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   It's arrogance.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   It's cheek.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.200]   And so he tears it up and throws it into the fire.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.640]   His pride is hurt.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.840]   And that's one of the main reasons still why people don't listen to this message.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.240]   Instead of patting us on the back and telling us how wonderful we are, he tells us that
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:32.800]   we are born in sin and shaped in iniquity, that we are a mass of corruption, that the
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   things we do are bad enough, but the things we think of and the things we enjoy in imagination
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   are even worse.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.000]   Instead of patting us on the back and telling us how wonderful we are, he tells us that
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.560]   we are born in sin and shaped in iniquity, that we are a mass of corruption, that the
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.640]   things we do are bad enough, but the things we think of and the things we enjoy in imagination
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.520]   are even worse.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.880]   That there's no goodness at all.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   That's the message.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.240]   And the modern man hates it.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   And that's why he tears it up and dismisses it with his contempt and arrogance.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.840]   But there's something in addition to the pride.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.160]   There is a depravity in men also, a natural depravity that makes him do this.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.360]   Why did this king resent this message so much?
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.640]   Well, you see, this is it.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.240]   It condemns the life he was living.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.520]   And he liked the life he was living.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.480]   Here's a king of Judah who should have been living a life according to God's Ten Commandments,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.520]   but this man didn't think that that was the sort of life to live.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.040]   The life he was living was a life in which he had a number of wives and concubines, in
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.520]   which he drank and gave reign to his sex and all his impulses and desires.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.480]   He lived to please himself and to gratify his baser instincts.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.600]   That was the kind of life he enjoyed.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   And here comes a message condemning it.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.760]   Our Lord said this, didn't he?
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:15.440]   He said, "This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, but men loved
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.240]   darkness rather than light."
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.520]   Loved it, not only believed in it, but loved in it, gloated in it.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.040]   And the world is still doing the same tonight.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.480]   You know, the trouble about the Bible is not your great intellect, my friend, it's that
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.000]   it condemns your life.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.760]   It tells you that you've not got to live this life of just giving way to lusts and
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.800]   desires and passions.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.840]   It condemns all that, but you love that, you like it, this is what you want.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:52.440]   And the modern man hates it because it condemns his debased and unworthy life and living.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.880]   Or put it the other way around, he disliked this message not only because it condemned
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:04.960]   what he was doing, but because he disliked also what it asked him to do.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:14.320]   Ten commandments, moral law, living a life of serving God, loving God with all your heart
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:21.840]   and mind and soul and strength, loving your neighbor as yourself, what a life.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.040]   Look at it, says the modern man, reading your Bible, what a life.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.840]   Praying, praying with others, what a life.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.760]   Stopping all that you enjoy and that you want to do, living this narrow, straight-laced
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   life.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   "Ah," they say, "they hate it.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.720]   That's why they get into a passion.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.440]   This is a book that calls you to live a life of holiness, a life of worship of God, a life
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.120]   of truth and justice and righteousness, a life of honor, a life that means that your
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.840]   word is your bond and that you don't go into another man's married life and wreck it and
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.400]   give misery to his little children."
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.800]   He doesn't want to live that sort of life.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.320]   He wants to do what he wants to do and what he likes to do.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.160]   The thing of the moment, whatever the consequences, he hates what's, he hates being condemned,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.560]   he hates being called to this life of holiness.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.880]   Well, our Lord has said it all.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:22.620]   They not only love darkness, but they hate the light, hatred of light.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.040]   And it's true, my dear friend.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.840]   What's your attitude towards this life of God?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.460]   Would you like to live with Jesus Christ always and live as he lived?
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.840]   Would you like that sort of life?
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:45.800]   An end to all the lustful living and a life of denial of self, self-control, discipline,
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:52.600]   temperance, cleanliness, purity, holiness, worshipping God, studying his word.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.760]   How do you react to it?
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:05.320]   Man by nature is depraved and he loves the darkness and he hates the light of God.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.280]   That's why he burns the book.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.600]   His whole nature is against it.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:16.760]   But you notice in addition to that there is this foolhardiness and bravado, this arrogant
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.240]   defiance of God.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.960]   Here they are with everything going wrong, everything had gone wrong in Israel.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   Their army was weak, they hadn't got money.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.800]   Here's the powerful enemy coming and still in spite of that, you see, throw the book
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.280]   into the fire, Rome is burning but Nero goes on fiddling.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   "Yes," says our Lord again, "as they were in the days of Noah, even so shall they be
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.720]   at the end of this age.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:56.440]   They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until the
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:03.960]   flood came and carried them all away on the brink of disaster.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.320]   Carry on, roll out the barrels, have a good time.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:17.040]   Yes, as I'm pointing out Sunday by Sunday, you look at your newspaper, left-hand columns,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   crisis.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.880]   Fifty megaton bomb to be let off.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.360]   There it is, the whole world is in this convulsion.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:33.480]   The other side, ah, a marriage so-called.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.200]   Chopping and changing wives, living the life of lust.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.000]   Yes, on the brink of the inferno.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.360]   Carry on.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.800]   The flood's about to come, doesn't matter.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:52.840]   Marrying and giving in marriage, eating and drinking, planting and sowing, until the flood
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.360]   came and carried them all away.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.000]   The bravado of this man, and can't you see it in the modern world?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.580]   Why can't people even be serious if they can't become Christian?
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.000]   Why doesn't the whole world suddenly become sober in its awful moment of crisis?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.080]   No, no, the bravado of it all.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.200]   Blaspheme God, curse Christ, laugh at Christianity.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:24.800]   Though the whole world, I say, is on the verge of going up in flames.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.880]   These are the causes of burning the book.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:34.280]   In other words, I can sum it all up in this, it's a hatred of God.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:39.840]   The natural mind, says the apostle Paul in Romans 8, 7, is enmity against God, is not
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.040]   subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.880]   The trouble is, my friend, that you as you are, are a hater of God.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.040]   You hate the thought of him, you wish it could be proved there isn't a God.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.840]   Hatred of God, that was the trouble in this man's heart.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.720]   It's the trouble in every man's heart by nature.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.080]   Don't tell me that you do a lot of good, don't say you say your prayers, that's not what
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   I'm asking you.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.080]   Do you really know this God?
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.440]   Is your life surrendered to him?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.100]   Are you living for his glory?
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:17.320]   If not, you're a hater of God, because he asks for a totalitarian allegiance.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.840]   That's why the man burned the book.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   But come, let me come to my fourth and most solemn comment on this incident.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   The folly and the futility of what this king did and what the modern man is doing, the
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.560]   folly and the futility of it, listen.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.200]   Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah after that the king had burned the row and
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.080]   the words which Barak wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah saying, "Take thee again another
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.480]   row and write in it all the former words that were in the first row which Jehoiakim the
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.000]   king of Judah burned."
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.600]   Then Jeremiah took another row and gave it to Barak the scribe, the son of Neriah, who
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.160]   wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim, king
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:16.120]   of Judah, had burned in the fire, and they were added besides unto them many like words.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   What does it mean?
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.000]   Let me put it in principle.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.880]   You can burn the book.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.280]   You can, as you think, destroy it.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.760]   You can reject the word of the Lord.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:40.440]   But by so doing you change nothing at all.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.560]   You have achieved precisely nothing.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.720]   Oh, the king thought he was very clever.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.160]   The princes roared with laughter.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   They were not a bit afraid.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.800]   They thought it was a huge joke.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.480]   This was really a very clever thing to do, this prophet Jeremiah, this miserable man
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:01.040]   who was always prophesying these pessimistic things, this Jeremiah, this constant Jeremiah.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.040]   This was marvelous.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   That's the way to treat him.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Throw it into the fire.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.600]   But it hasn't, you see.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   It all comes back.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.840]   It's all still there.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:20.040]   This foolish king, by doing what he did, achieved nothing.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.200]   And the modern man who rejects the word of this book again does precisely nothing.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   Why?
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.720]   Well, for this reason.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.680]   God remains ever always the same.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.240]   You can say you don't believe in him.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.440]   You can say that you're never going to listen to this sort of thing again.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.560]   My dear friend, you don't make the slightest difference to the situation.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.200]   God is not affected by your opinions nor by mine.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.720]   God is from eternity to eternity.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.440]   Did you notice this striking word?
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:58.200]   "Thou shalt say to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, 'Thus saith the Lord, thou hast burned this
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.400]   rule saying, why hast thou written therein saying, 'The king of Babylon shall certainly
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.280]   come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from hence men and beasts.'
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:18.040]   Therefore, thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim, king of Judah."
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.320]   You see, he thought because he was a king he could do this sort of thing.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   He forgets that the Lord is his Lord, he's above him.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.160]   You see, kings are not on top.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.840]   There is a king of kings.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   There is a Lord of lords.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.760]   Over and above men and all his greatness and his ability is the everlasting God.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.120]   And do what you will, you don't change him.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:46.720]   "He is the father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of darkness."
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.360]   God doesn't change.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.040]   And not only does God not change, his word doesn't change.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.000]   The man's got rid of it, but it's back again.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.160]   There it is speaking to him once more.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:07.600]   "Yes, heaven and earth says our Lord shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.120]   When these bonds have been let off and this universe of ours is nothing, the word of the
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.920]   Lord will still be there.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:21.440]   All flesh is as grass and all the goodliness of men is the flower of grass.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.080]   The grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth and fadeth away.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:35.200]   But the word of the Lord endureth forever and ever and ever.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.880]   When all man's glory is gone and it's going rapidly before our eyes and it's all going
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:47.560]   to go, the word of the Lord endureth and abideth forever."
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.640]   You can't get rid of it.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.240]   You can burn it, you can do this and that, it comes back.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.000]   It's God's word, it's a living word, it's an abiding word, and you'll never get rid
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   of it.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.040]   It'll always be there facing you.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.160]   What a futile thing to do.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:11.240]   My dear friend, facts abide and we can't get rid of them.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.960]   And the facts you see are these.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:20.920]   Evil and sin always lead to trouble.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.400]   If you believe the world, you're a fool.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.560]   The world says, "Don't listen to such nonsense.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   Come my way.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.960]   I'll give you a wonderful life.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.360]   Come, there's nothing in it.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.360]   There's no danger.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   Come along.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   Do this with me.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.720]   There'll be no trouble."
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   Won't there?
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:41.960]   The Bible says from the beginning that the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:50.240]   The Bible also teaches, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   And isn't it true?
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.680]   Haven't you proved it true already?
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.720]   You do evil, you'll bear the consequences, you're bound to.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   You can't help it.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.960]   You'll have remorse, if nothing else.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.400]   You'll have an accusing conscience.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.900]   You'll be unhappy.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.560]   And it'll lead to endless consequences.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   Why our papers are full of them now.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.560]   Look at these problems that are coming back into life again because people don't believe
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   this world.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.400]   Look what's happening to our adolescents.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.920]   Look at the doctors and what they're saying about all this terrible new problem that's
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   arising.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.600]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.000]   What a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   This is an absolute rule.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.480]   It's always been true.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.800]   It's still true.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.440]   You can't change facts by saying you don't believe them.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.840]   You burn your Bible, but the fact remains.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.100]   Put your finger into the fire, you'll be burned.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.520]   You lose something.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:43.160]   You lose some purity, chastity, something that's more precious than life itself.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.800]   It's inevitable you can't help it.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.560]   You can't change facts.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.640]   Do what you like.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.000]   And then, of course, there is the great fact of death.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.120]   What fools we are.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.160]   If we'd got an endless lease on life, well, I could understand men playing with this word.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.880]   But you know, we are here today and gone tomorrow.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.760]   In the midst of life, we are in death.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.960]   And yet here we are, fools.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.440]   You've got to meet that fact of death, my friend.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.960]   How are you going to meet it?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   Do you know?
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.320]   Does your modern world help you?
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.960]   And the answer is, it doesn't.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.760]   You know it doesn't.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.920]   And by saying that you don't want to be reminded of death, that it'll come soon enough without
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.040]   being reminded, well, how does it help you?
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.660]   Because it's bound to come, and you don't know when.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.560]   And then beyond it is God and the judgment.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:44.160]   You see, this Bible, this book, teaches this.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:52.260]   That this world in which you and I live is coming to an end.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.320]   That this world is a world which is under the condemnation of God.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.080]   God's not going to let this world go on like this.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.480]   He didn't make the world as it is now.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.240]   He made a perfect world.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.040]   And He's going to see to it that that perfect world is going to be restored.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.840]   And He's going to do that by sending His Son back again into this world.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   He's going to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.360]   He is going to punish all evil and all who've lived for evil.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.720]   He's going to punish all sin and all who've been sinners.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.360]   He's going to punish all those who haven't believed in His Son and haven't repented and
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.980]   believed this word of reconciliation.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.040]   He has announced that He's going to do that.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.760]   I don't know when He's going to do it.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.080]   I don't know how.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.320]   I don't know the place of these atomic bombs in all this.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   God may use them, He may not use them.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.160]   But whether He does or not, He is going to end this world.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.840]   There is going to be the destruction of evil.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.080]   And every one of us will stand before God in the judgment.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   And the thing that will decide our eternal destiny is this.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.720]   Have we been reconciled to God in Christ or have we not?
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.880]   If we haven't, we go to everlasting destruction.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:14.960]   Now, you and I can do what we like about that message.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:20.280]   We can burn our Bibles as Jehia Kim burned the world, but it won't make the slightest
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.360]   difference.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.420]   In other words, I want to end on this note with you.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.080]   This man was utterly foolish and what he did was futile for this reason, that what God
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:44.400]   has said always comes to pass, never fails.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.240]   Our God is a God, says Paul to Titus, who cannot lie.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.960]   What God says, God does.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.600]   He has always done it.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.040]   I have already given you what happened in the Garden of Eden.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:02.320]   He told the men, "The day thou sinnest, thou shalt die, you will be driven out."
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.000]   And he was.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.680]   Look at this case.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.280]   Do you know that what Jeremiah said to this King Jehia Kim literally and actually did
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   come to pass?
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   Indeed it did.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.160]   This is sheer history.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.200]   What God said, God did.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.160]   See it in the case of Cain.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.960]   See it before the flood.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:33.240]   For a hundred and twenty years, Noah pleaded with the people to repent and to stop sinning
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.400]   and to turn back to God, saying that a terrible calamity was coming.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:45.440]   They laughed him to scorn, but it came.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:54.880]   John the Baptist and our Lord Jesus Christ himself warned their own generation of Jews
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:02.120]   that if they did not repent and turn to God and believe in Christ as the Messiah, that
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:07.160]   the city of Jerusalem would be destroyed, it would be conquered by an enemy and razed
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   to the ground, and that the nation of Israel would be cast out amongst the nations of the
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.160]   world.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:22.160]   They said it, and in A.D. 70 it literally came to pass.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:30.680]   What God says must come to pass, for God is God, and he is eternal, and his word is eternal.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.960]   But here is a man who defies all this.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.760]   He stands up against God.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.160]   "Oh, the unutterable folly," I say.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.640]   Why not recognize the inevitability of what God is saying to us?
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.920]   "What is the matter with this man?"
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.840]   "Well, this man," I say again, "is a fool."
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.840]   What is he doing?
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.960]   He is pitting himself against the Almighty and the everlasting God, and all he is doing
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.640]   is to add to his troubles.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:57.720]   For not only were all the previous words written in the book, and they were added besides
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:04.920]   unto them many like words, it is even worse than it was before, because he has rejected
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:10.120]   the message of God on top of all he has done before, and that is the position of all who
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.720]   reject this gospel.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:24.280]   My dear friends, shall I plead with you as I close?
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.960]   My reason for preaching is the same reason that we are given here.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:36.120]   God said to Jeremiah, "It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil, that they
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:43.760]   may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.780]   Why should this king have listened to the message?
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.040]   Why should all of us listen to this message?
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.640]   Here is the answer.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.120]   It is God's message, not man's.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:02.440]   The ruler of the earth, the one in whose hands we are, every one of us, and from whom we
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   cannot escape.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.520]   It is God's message.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:10.360]   But take another reason, the essential rightness of the message.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.720]   What is there against the message of this book?
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.400]   Tell me, what is your criticism of the Ten Commandments?
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   What is wrong with them?
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.960]   What is wrong with being told not to kill, not to steal, not to bear false witness, not
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.960]   to commit adultery?
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.320]   What is wrong in it?
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.920]   What is wrong with that way of living?
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.360]   Can't you see this?
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.360]   If only everybody in the world lived tonight according to the Ten Commandments and the
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.840]   Sermon on the Mount, there would be no crisis, there would be no danger, there would be none
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.040]   of these horrible moral problems.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:45.800]   If only everybody in the world believed this message, which is so right and true and holy
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.200]   and righteous, the world would be perfect.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.040]   There is nothing wrong with it.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.280]   It is essentially right.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:56.440]   Oh, what a reason for believing it and accepting it.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.000]   But listen to what it offers.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.400]   It offers you forgiveness and pardon.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:11.480]   It may be that they will return, that I may forgive their iniquity and sin.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.280]   Oh, my dear friend, had you realized that?
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.160]   Here is a message that comes to you and tells you, though you have sinned against God and
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:26.760]   deserve nothing but punishment and suffering and hell, if you repent and believe in Christ,
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.800]   your sins and iniquities will be forgiven.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.280]   They will be blotted out.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.560]   He will remember them no more.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.400]   He will cast them into the sea of his forgetfulness.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:40.680]   As far as the East is from the West, so far has God removed our iniquities from us.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.280]   He is offering you that, just as you are.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.560]   He doesn't ask you suddenly to live a wonderful life and prove that you are a good man.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.240]   He offers it to you here and now, for nothing.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.680]   Christ died that we might be forgiven.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:56:01.280]   The free offer of forgiveness and salvation, that you become a child of God and an heir
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:09.360]   of eternal bliss, and to receive all the untold blessings of God that baffle the imagination,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.720]   all that is offered.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:21.920]   It is, I say, what makes the case of a man like Jehiachim finally utterly inexcusable.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:28.480]   If the message were merely one of condemnation, if the message were merely one of threatening
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:35.760]   of doom and disaster, well, there would be some excuse for him.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.480]   But the message goes on to offer pardon, free pardon.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:49.240]   It tells us that God so loved us and the world that he gave his only begotten Son to death
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:55.080]   for us, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:06.400]   God, my dear friend, would have you as his Son and an heir and a joint heir with Christ,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   and will shower his blessings.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.720]   That is what he is offering.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:18.880]   Is it possible that anybody, having looked at the case of this King Jehiachim, having
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:26.920]   seen his unutterable folly and the futility of what he does, anyone who has heard the
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   gracious offer and invitation of God in Christ to come, to be forgiven, to be washed, to
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:44.520]   be cleansed, to be given a new nature and an everlasting hope, surely, having looked
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:52.640]   at it objectively in this other person, surely no one can imitate his folly.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.240]   You cannot get rid of your relationship to God.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:04.680]   Very well, then, recognize it, acknowledge it, turn back, confess your sin, turn to him,
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:09.000]   tell him all about it, plead for pardon, and he will give it to you.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.320]   He will freely forgive you.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:20.280]   And when the calamity comes to the world, as it will come, you need have no fear.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.680]   You will be already saved.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:34.240]   You will be already safe in the arms of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:45.720]   May God open all our eyes to our position and our predicament, and to the amazing offer
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:57.760]   of God's grace and God's love, may we see it, ere it be too late.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.880]   Amen.
