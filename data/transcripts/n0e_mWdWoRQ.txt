[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Yeah, these are outdated. Now, this was at the time to break the all-time touchdown record.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I think Breeze and Brady have broken that record several times since then.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Oh, really?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   But at the time, Brett Favre had the all-time touchdown record,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   and so that pass was to break it.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   But what I liked about it is that we won the game.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You know, we weren't doing anything just to try to build a record, right?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Did that get tipped?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Kind of a close game.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   No, I threw a lot of wobbly passes, Mike.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Oh, did you?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   It just looked like they got tipped, but I appreciate you asking that.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   No, so that was cool.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Yeah, it was still in the second quarter, so we broke the record
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and kind of got that over with and went on to win the game.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But I love quarterbacks.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Yeah, they played keep-away with me from the football afterwards.
