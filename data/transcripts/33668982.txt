[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.520]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.760]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.600]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.520]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.520]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.200]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.920]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.440]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.720]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.400]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.120]   about a topic that grew dearer to my heart
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.640]   as my years of tutoring went on.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.160]   We're gonna talk about the science fair project today,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   and I can remember when that was not
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.160]   my favorite topic of discussion.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.240]   And I can remember the years of shepherding my own students
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.000]   through the process and sometimes loving it
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.880]   and sometimes ruining the day we ever got started with it.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.240]   But I have a very encouraging guest,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   one who has lots of answers to share,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   and Emily Martin has come to be the guest today.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.200]   Emily is the academic advisor
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   who gives all manner of good counsel and advice
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   to parents and directors for challenges A, B, and 1.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.400]   And Emily is gonna help walk us through
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   the beauties and delights of the science fair project.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.840]   Emily, thank you so much for agreeing to come on today.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.700]   - Well, thank you for having me.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.520]   - I think that this is gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.120]   Let me ask you this.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   Were you a science-loving kid growing up?
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.160]   - So I would say I've always had an interest in science.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   - Oh, cool.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.560]   - But I can't say that I've always understood science.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   - Okay, now see, that is a really great distinction.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.080]   So you as a child were interested in science things
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040]   or in asking questions maybe and knowing why,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.360]   but you didn't always feel like you totally got it?
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.240]   - Right, yeah.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   So I enjoyed always watching "The Magic School Bus"
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   or I would always be interested in science in school,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.560]   but it was the why things are the way they are
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.120]   were always difficult for me to fully understand.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.520]   - Right, right.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   I remember that I loved to read.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.680]   And so I like to read all kinds of stuff
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   and I liked to read science books
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.200]   and I liked to think about experiments
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000]   and I liked to know why things happened.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.960]   But you know what?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.160]   I think as a child,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.600]   it was for a very narrow spectrum of things.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.000]   Like I was really interested in the things
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   I was interested in and not so much about the things
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.480]   that had never dawned on me
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.920]   or had never piqued my interest.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.320]   So I don't know if I would say that I myself
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.760]   was a big science person,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   but I do remember my kids really loving to experiment,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.720]   especially when they were little,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.280]   they were always asking me,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.520]   "What would happen if we did this?"
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.440]   And I would say, "Well, I mean, I don't know."
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.120]   "Well, can we try it?"
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.280]   You know, and my knee-jerk reaction was,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.440]   "No, of course not, that's gonna make a mess
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.000]   or it's gonna use up something in my kitchen
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.720]   or we're gonna spill something
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.920]   or you're gonna get dirty
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.400]   or that's gonna take a long time
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.200]   or I have to go buy something."
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   But then I would stop myself.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680]   As a homeschooling mom, I would stop and say,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   "Okay, let's see how far we can chase their curiosity."
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.000]   And so I can remember doing experiments on buoyancy
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760]   when my daughter was five
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.600]   and it all started because she wanted to know,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.880]   will this rock float in my bathtub
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.560]   and what about my Polly Pocket?
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   And so I let them chase their curiosity.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.640]   Were your kids curious when they were little?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.040]   - Yes, they were.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.480]   I remember doing a lot of experiments
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.840]   during the winter time.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.080]   - Oh.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   - If I put a cup of water outside, will it freeze?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.920]   - Yeah.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   - Yeah, a lot of that.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.520]   Yeah, especially my boys.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.440]   My boys were always very, very curious.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.240]   Got all sorts of things, especially space.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.120]   And we got my son a telescope at the age of six.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.760]   So, and we stayed up late one night
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.640]   so he can look at the moon through the telescope.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.960]   And my daughter just the other day
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.160]   found a bunch of beakers that we have.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.760]   And I currently direct Challenge One
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.920]   and we have to have those
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.160]   for a lot of the Challenge One experiments.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   - Right.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.480]   - And so I'd taken them home and had to wash them out.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.520]   They were all over the counter.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.440]   Well, she decided, she's 10.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.760]   She's like, "I'm going to grab these beakers
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   and I'm going to do a space project."
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   And they were all over the floor.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.360]   And she was checking the temperature of water
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.840]   and mixing things up in these beakers.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.320]   And there were probably six of them
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.080]   all over my kitchen floor.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.920]   - Oh my word.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.600]   - And that was one of those moments I had to hold back
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   and say, "Don't worry about the mess.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.440]   It's about the curiosity."
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.280]   - Yeah.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.560]   Well, and she was learning to use some of the tools
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   that a scientist uses.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.280]   That's what I was going to ask you.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.400]   How is it, how can we help our children,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.440]   even our little kids, our younger kids,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.280]   think like a scientist?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.400]   And what is it that we can do at home
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.320]   without a curriculum or without a textbook necessarily
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   to help our kids think like a scientist?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.480]   - I love this question because I found myself,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.080]   even as a young mom, before we started CEC,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.160]   instead of giving my children the answers,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.880]   I asked them more questions.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.600]   So for example, they would say,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.720]   "Mom, what would happen if I picked this flower?"
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.080]   And so, "Well, okay, let's think about it.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   What are the parts of the flower?"
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.480]   And they might say, "Well, petals and leaves
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   and a stem and roots."
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.760]   Like, "Yep, that's right."
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   "Okay, so now what happens when you pick that flower?
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.360]   What parts of the flower do you have now?"
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.240]   And they might say, "The petals and the leaves and the stem."
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.840]   "Okay, so what do we know about the roots?"
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.400]   "Oh, the roots help give it water.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.120]   It helps suck up the water and it gives it its food, right?"
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.560]   And, "Okay, so if you pick a flower
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.000]   and the roots are not on it anymore,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.080]   then what do you think might happen to the flower?"
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.320]   And they'd say, "Oh, it can't get the food anymore
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.360]   and it might die."
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.400]   "Well, there you go.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.160]   So what happens when you pick a flower?"
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.080]   "Oh, well, it'll eventually die."
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.480]   And so, it's asking more questions
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.720]   instead of giving the answers.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.440]   You help them think through that whole process.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.720]   - That's great.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600]   I mean, and that is so easy.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.200]   And people are gonna listen to this podcast, Emily,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.280]   and think, "Oh, well, that is so obvious."
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   You just keep asking them questions
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.200]   and you just keep going deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.400]   And it is so obvious, but we don't do it sometimes.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.880]   Or we think that we really need a science book
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   or a science unit study or some kind of curriculum
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.920]   in order to help our children think like a scientist.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.320]   But your example is perfect.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   And it reminds me of a story that I heard one time
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.680]   of a really famous scientist,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.280]   and I can't remember who it was,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.720]   who was going around,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.960]   he was visiting some factories in England.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.120]   And this was like, I think back in the '40s and the '50s.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   And so he was visiting
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.600]   and he was going through just the assembly line,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.080]   just the "regular people."
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.480]   So he was a high-muckety-muck scientist
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.200]   and he was coming to look at their production line.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.880]   And he stopped to talk to a lady
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.280]   who just looked so bored by what she was doing.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.920]   And he was always so interested, he said,
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.600]   in everything around him
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.840]   that he didn't understand how anybody could be so bored.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.320]   And so he stopped to talk to her and he said,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.440]   "Well, are you not interested in what you're doing?"
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   And she said, "Well, no."
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.320]   And he said, "Well, why not?
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.640]   You should always be interested in what you're doing."
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   And she said something to the effect
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.280]   that all I do all day is stand on this brick floor
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.560]   and make my part of this product.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.080]   That's all I do.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.400]   And he said, "Well..."
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   And she said, "And my feet hurt."
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.960]   And he said, "Well, why do you think your feet hurt?"
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.680]   And she said, "Because I stand on bricks all day."
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   And so he said, "Well, what kind of brick?"
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   And she looked at him funny and she's like,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.280]   "Well, I don't know, it's just brick."
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.080]   And so he said, "Well, why don't you find out about the brick?"
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   And he went on down the line
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.960]   and she was just left standing there thinking about the brick.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.640]   But when she went home,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.600]   she discovered she was still thinking about the brick.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   So she went to the library and read about brick
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.880]   and found out that there are lots of different kinds of brick
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.680]   and the amount of support it gives to your feet
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.080]   and the porousness of the brick,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   it's all related to what the brick is made of.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.720]   So she kept studying, what is the brick made of?
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.560]   And he came back through the factory
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.040]   and said, "Well, what..."
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.640]   She looked a little more interested and she said,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.280]   "I found out all about brick
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.240]   and now I guess I've gone as far as I can go."
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.520]   And he said, "No, what's under the brick?"
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.280]   And she's like, "Oh my word."
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.120]   But she dug out the brick
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.400]   and she found this certain kind of dirt
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.960]   and there were ants under it.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.760]   Long story short, she continued to ask questions
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.360]   and continued to study.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.920]   And in 15 years, she had become the foremost expert
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.280]   on some certain kind of ant
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.720]   in the entire country of England.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.560]   - Oh, wow.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.400]   - All from just asking a question
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.280]   and going deeper and staying curious.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.120]   And so I love what you said.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.720]   We just ask our kids questions
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.400]   and that helps them to think like a scientist,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   exploring and reading and even what you said, using tools.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.120]   Get your kids some beakers and some eyedroppers
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.560]   and maybe some calipers and some simple machines
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.960]   and some thermometers.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   Just give them the tools of a scientist and let them play.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.080]   I love that.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.600]   - Yeah, and like I said,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.280]   my kids love doing the wintertime experiments.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   And so it's, okay, well, what's the temperature outside?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.560]   What's the low tonight?
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.280]   And all right, if you wanna see when,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.520]   if the water freezes, go for it.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.200]   Then the next morning, well, oh, it didn't freeze.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.560]   Okay, well, what's the freezing temperature of water?
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.240]   And asking them, oh, well, it's 32 degrees.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.720]   Okay, what was the low last night?
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.400]   Well, it was only 43.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.200]   So do you think we have a reason?
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.040]   No, things like that, asking the questions.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   - I love it, I love it.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.920]   Now, lots of families jumped on this podcast
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.320]   because they're challenge A families
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.160]   and they are jumping into the science fair now.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   So for those families who are dipping their toes
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.480]   into the science fair,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.120]   can the science fair become a family affair?
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   I know we talk a lot about the one room schoolhouse
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.680]   and moms trying to educate all of their children,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.720]   even though they're doing different things at the same time.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.800]   How can families pull all of their kids
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.200]   into the science fair,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.040]   even if only one of the students is a challenge A student?
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.280]   - Yeah, so I will use my son for an example.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.600]   He went through challenge A a few years ago
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   and his experiment was to see what type of bridge
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.800]   can hold the most weight.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.720]   And so we researched the different designs of bridges
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   and you built these bridges out of popsicle sticks
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.040]   and Elmer's glue.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.920]   It was really basic.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.840]   And so in that case, we ended up, I think,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.040]   using somewhere around 900 popsicle sticks
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.880]   for this experiment. - Wow.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.080]   - Because you have to test it more than once.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.920]   - Oh, that's true, that is very true.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.560]   - And so we built three different bridges twice.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.840]   So we went up six bridges.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.280]   And so during that process,
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.680]   my other two younger children
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   got in on helping us glue the popsicle sticks together.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.320]   We kind of had an assembly line situation set up.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.680]   And then when it came to testing,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.080]   we had to put weight on these bridges
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.120]   to see how much weight they could hold.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.520]   And so my husband was in the garage with my son
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.640]   and they were working together to weigh all of these
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.040]   or put the weights on the bridges.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.480]   And we had another person who was the photographer
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.840]   so we could have pictures of the whole thing and video.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.080]   And so in that case,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.600]   our whole family got involved in this project.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.680]   I know another family who,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.600]   they wanted to test hand sanitizers
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   and the ones that were most effective.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.800]   So everybody got a turn to stick their dirty hands
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   on Petri dishes. (laughing)
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.640]   And especially ones where you have plants.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.040]   You can always have kids go and water the plant.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.000]   We need to fill the water to this line
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.200]   and put it on the plant.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.720]   And so I think there are definitely ways
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.600]   to get the whole family involved.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.080]   One of my friend's daughters
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.160]   is going to test the fluffiness of buttercream.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.240]   So I can imagine a lot of helpers
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.680]   eating that buttercream ice cream.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   - Yes, I'm sure she'll have plenty of volunteers for that.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.200]   I know that when one of my daughters
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.760]   was doing the science fair project,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.160]   she was into more of the testing
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.080]   and the tabulating the results.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.600]   She wasn't as into making her science fair board
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.680]   and the presentation aspect of that
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.000]   and knowing what colors and what shapes and all that.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   But her younger sister was really into
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.840]   what colors will pop and what are good combinations
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   and what will make things stand out
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.480]   and what other colors or situations
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.840]   would make information recede.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.680]   And so that was one way that the younger sibling
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.560]   was able to help the older
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.280]   simply by virtue of what they were interested in.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   I think it definitely can turn into a whole family affair
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.240]   very easily, especially when you have a project
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.160]   that the whole family is excited about.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.840]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   - And picking a topic, and we're gonna get to that,
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.200]   actually, maybe we should just go back up a little bit
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.880]   and actually talk about the science fair.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.760]   What are the parts of the science fair project?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   - Yes, okay, so I have divided in true CC form
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.880]   our parts into three sections.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.240]   So I think you have your invention,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.440]   your arrangement, and the elocution.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.760]   So the invention is your ideas.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.480]   You know, like what, like you need to, of course,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.640]   start with a great idea,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.800]   something that you are excited about,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.200]   because it's a project that your student
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.320]   is going to be working with for, you know,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.440]   two to three months.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.000]   So a good idea, and the problem.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.360]   So every science, every good science fair project
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.200]   has a problem.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.840]   Like, what is this problem that we're working with?
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.640]   And what question arises from this problem?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.280]   So for the case of my son
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.920]   and what bridge can hold the most weight?
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.200]   I mean, that was his question.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.440]   The problem is we have bridges all over the world
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.360]   and what is the best design for these bridges?
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.880]   And then your background research,
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.800]   let's gather the information and figure out,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.200]   what do I need to know to move forward with my project?
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.600]   - Right, right.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   - And then that brings us into the arrangement.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   Okay, what are the steps of this experiment?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   So that's a procedure.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.400]   So you're gonna, you know, work out the procedure
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.800]   and what is your plan of action,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.000]   followed by materials and safety considerations.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.560]   And so that's your whole plan.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.760]   That's how you're arranging your experiment.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.000]   You're gathering everything you need
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.960]   in order to execute the experiment.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.200]   So that'd be your elocution.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.840]   It's actually doing the experiment
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.000]   and observing the results,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.960]   writing them down in your lab journal,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.440]   taking really, really good notes.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.320]   And of course, keeping up with your research plan.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.520]   - Yes.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.400]   - So, and that's a whole other ball game
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.880]   that I could go into if you would like.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.240]   - Yeah, I want us to get to that
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.920]   because I know that, you know,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.880]   there are certain things in the challenge program
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.560]   that give parents pause.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.600]   And a lot of times it's those things
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   that we've never done ourselves
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.440]   or we didn't do well ourselves, you know,
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.480]   like mock trial or a senior thesis
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.640]   or the science fair project.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   And so if we never really got into science as a student
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.600]   or if our parents didn't push us
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.920]   to be involved in a local science fair,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.960]   or we never had to do it for a class,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.760]   then a lot of us as parents are kind of left floundering.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   And we want to do our best by our students,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.640]   but we don't really know.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.400]   I mean, we do know that it starts with an idea, okay?
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   And that is, you're right, Emily,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.360]   that is what students have to do first is to pick a topic.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.640]   So let's walk through it.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.200]   We'll walk through all those pieces
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.480]   because some of them are more obvious than others.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.560]   So, all right, what do students do first?
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.120]   You said, we got to start with an idea.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.160]   And I love that you remind us that it needs to be something
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.080]   that our student is excited about
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.120]   because they are going to spend
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.640]   a sizable amount of time on this.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.320]   So the first, yeah, of course they have their idea.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.560]   And once they have that idea,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.560]   they want to get their lab journal.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.920]   The lab journal is such an important piece to this puzzle.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   I like to think of it as the place for like the brain dump.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   It's every idea that they have,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.560]   every question they have,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.160]   all needs to go into the lab journal.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.520]   And so there are, of course, questions.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.200]   There's a way to set up the lab journal
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.960]   that their director will instruct them on how to do that.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.720]   But the first thing they'll do in that lab journal
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.040]   is to write out their research problem.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.560]   So what is the problem that they have?
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.640]   And then take that and form their question.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.160]   So once they get that done,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.000]   they're simultaneously going to be working
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.080]   on their research plan.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.800]   The research plan and the journal differ
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.440]   in that the research plan is an actual typed document
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.480]   that they'll keep,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.400]   and that that will then later transfer
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.320]   into their research paper
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.880]   that they will present to the judges later.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.480]   So as they're working through their lab journal,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.320]   they're gonna end up putting those same pieces
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   of their journal onto their Word document.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.800]   But I always say it's really great
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.120]   for the parents to look at the lab journal
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.960]   and have it approved.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.440]   Anything that they have in that lab journal,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.520]   give it the green light before they go
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.240]   and type it up on their research plan,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.160]   or they're just gonna have to go back and redo
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.000]   if the parent--
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.600]   - So for instance, if it calls for,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.360]   I know this has happened to me before.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.200]   We used to do Science Fair in Challenge B
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.240]   that I taught, tutored for years and years.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.000]   And I would always have kids who wanted
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   to design these really intricate experiments.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.880]   And they called for all these hard to get ingredients.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.080]   And so I always reminded my kids,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.440]   look, here's the truth.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's probably not gonna work well
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.160]   the first time you do it.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.680]   And you're gonna have to do this probably at least twice,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   maybe more than that.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.160]   You need to ask your mom and dad,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.120]   these are expensive ingredients
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.200]   and you can't just get it at the neighborhood Walmart.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.680]   So you need to be sure that it's okay with mom and dad
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.480]   that you're laying out this kind of expense
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.040]   and time to get this.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   Is that the kind of thing that you think parents
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.760]   need to check behind?
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.360]   - Absolutely, yes.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.880]   And following the parameters of no humans or pets.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.840]   - Right.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.600]   - So that's always a big consideration as well.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.760]   So yeah, and even as they're working through
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   the whole steps, double checking the problem.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   Is this the right problem we're trying to solve?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.560]   Is this the right question to ask?
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.640]   Yeah, I think parents need to be involved definitely
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.480]   in every step of the way,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.000]   just to make sure that the students are staying on track
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.600]   because we are still dealing with 12 year olds.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.160]   - Right, right.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.960]   - We think of challenges,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.520]   oh, you've graduated into this upper level.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.400]   But then when you really think on it,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   well, these guys are still 12, 13 years old.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.840]   They're still in the learning process.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.320]   - Yes, and there are some things they don't have
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.120]   a realistic idea about.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.120]   Timetables is one of those.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.840]   They think that everything can be completed
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.120]   in one weekend, one Saturday.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.360]   Oh, it's only gonna take me a week to really do this.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.960]   So I can wait until a week and a half before it's done.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.360]   They don't realize that,
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.160]   oh, you mean mom can't just drop everything
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.360]   at the drop of a hat and help just me
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.720]   finish this by tomorrow?
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.760]   And so they're not realistic.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   - And if they are using their friends
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.160]   as subjects of the experiment,
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.840]   I mean, somebody else's mom's gonna have to bring them
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.720]   to your house.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.600]   And it's just the kind of thing
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   that doesn't naturally occur to Challenge A students.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.680]   - Right, yep.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.480]   Yeah, and so after they get that research question
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.280]   formulated and written correctly,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   then they'll start on their background research.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   All their research will go in their journal.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.480]   So any website they visit, any book they open,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.880]   any expert they may talk to,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.800]   it all gets recorded into that lab journal
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.520]   and making sure they have a great,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.040]   their bibliography because citing those sources
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.640]   is a really important step
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.560]   to keep it ethical and professional.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.960]   - This is great.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.680]   - Yeah, all that'll go in the lab journal.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.800]   And then again, once that's mom-approved or dad-approved,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.120]   then it gets put into that research plan
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.120]   that they're keeping track of.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.320]   - I love, one thing that you said,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.280]   I really wanna stop and camp out on
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.200]   because this is something that gets glossed over
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.400]   and our kids won't necessarily think about this.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.720]   You mentioned gathering their research
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.440]   and that all the notes that you take
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   from all of your sources go in your lab journal,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.000]   keep track of everything there.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.800]   But one thing you said really made my ears perk up
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.840]   because we don't often think about interviewing people
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.440]   as part of the research that our student could do
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.480]   for their science fair project.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.840]   I mean, in my era, I looked at books,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.360]   I mean, I went to the library
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.880]   to do almost all of my research
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.080]   'cause my family was not a homeschool family
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.200]   and we didn't have all these resources at home.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.240]   So a lot of times I went to the library
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.800]   and so I could look for online things,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   I could look for magazine or journal articles
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.960]   and books and all that stuff.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.840]   It never, I'm pretty sure that it never occurred to me
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.600]   to go and do an interview as a way to research.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   So talk about that, what kind of community resources
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.960]   might students find to interview?
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   - Yeah, so I had a student in challenge A a few years ago
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.680]   who wanted to see what was the best type of manure
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.480]   to grow plants.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.080]   And so- - Oh my word.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.200]   - Yes. - That is too fun.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.040]   - He's a really great, like very agricultural minded student.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.280]   And so, for example, one of his,
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   one of his research could have been talking
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.560]   to maybe the local agriculture teacher
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.200]   at the school or college nearby.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.360]   If you have a student wanting to do something with germs,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.960]   they could speak to a local doctor or microbiologist
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.800]   if they have maybe a university in the area.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:16.240]   I had another student wanting to grow mold on hamburgers
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.360]   to see which one grew the most mold.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.200]   And so, maybe speaking to somebody in the food industry
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.720]   might be a good start. - Right, right.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.480]   It's always fun to start making a list with your student
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.200]   of different people that you could ask questions of
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.760]   or different places to go.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.120]   If you have local community college
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.320]   or another kind of college,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   if you have industries in your town,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   most businesses, if you approach them,
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.480]   I mean, ahead of time,
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.680]   if you don't need the interview today or tomorrow,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.120]   they are way more willing to set up an interview
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   for your student to talk to some kind of expert in the field.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.760]   It's great.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.480]   Parents and students,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.800]   I can remember when my girls were 12,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.920]   I mean, they thought that pretty much
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   that I didn't know as much as they had hoped that I would.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.680]   And students forget that their parents have friends
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.960]   and that their parents have colleagues
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.560]   and that their parents have connections
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.240]   to people in the community.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.160]   So, moms and dads who are listening to this podcast,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.240]   remind your student that you can help them
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.000]   find people in the know
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.480]   that could be an interview resource for them.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.840]   That's really good.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.360]   That's just one of the ways
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.000]   that parents can be involved though, Emily.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.400]   How can parents be involved with the science fair,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.440]   but also give us some caution,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.240]   how involved should parents be?
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   - Yeah, that is a really tricky one, right?
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.640]   Because we know our students are learning
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   to be individuals and they're learning,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.800]   they're taking on that ownership, right?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.680]   That ownership, knowledge A.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.640]   But at the same time,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.600]   we also acknowledge, "Oh, but they still need my help."
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.080]   So, yeah, so we can offer encouraging words to them,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.040]   of course, like, "Okay, well, you can do this.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.960]   You're doing a great job, keep going."
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.200]   But beyond that, it's, I think,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.120]   I think probably the most difficult part of science fair
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.480]   is really that beginning stage, that invention stage,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.240]   where they're still wrestling with,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.080]   "What do I really wanna focus on?
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.040]   What is my big idea of my project?"
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.480]   And so the parent can say,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.400]   "Okay, well, how does this relate to that?"
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.640]   Okay, so going back to the bridge example,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.760]   "How does weight relate to structure?"
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.080]   And of course, most everybody,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.320]   even a two-year-old knows,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.520]   "If I put my foot on this, it's gonna break."
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.480]   So, okay, well, they got that.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.040]   Okay, so then what happens if?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.240]   So what happens if there's too much weight on this bridge?
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.320]   And then, okay, yeah,
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.760]   and so they start wrestling with those ideas.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.280]   And so, and if they need more motivation,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.600]   you know, think through ideas,
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.320]   you can say, you go back to the definitions.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.200]   "Okay, well, what is the definition of weight?"
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.240]   Or, "What is the definition of this?"
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.680]   And that really helps them start thinking
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.240]   about the basic ideas behind their question
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.440]   and what do they really need to define
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.920]   in order to draw that question out,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.040]   the big idea question
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.320]   for their overall science fair experiment.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.160]   - That's good.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   So generally, refining questions are good.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.880]   The things that help students sort of put the pieces,
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.840]   so connecting questions that will help the student
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.080]   put together pieces of information that they might have
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   or wonders that they have that will help them connect.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.680]   'Cause here's the thing, parents,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.160]   you might not have studied science in a long time,
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.800]   and you might think you have no interest
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.760]   in doing a science fair project personally,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.720]   but you still are a grownup and you have context.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   You have way more context in the world
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.200]   than your 12-year-old does.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.160]   And so you know how things might fit together.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   You are able to identify relationships that might exist,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.080]   and you're not necessarily, like Emily said,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.880]   telling your student what to do,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   but you're asking them questions that will prompt them
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.720]   to make the connections necessary to design,
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.360]   to ask a good question and design a good experiment.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.200]   - Right.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.280]   And then more practically too,
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.760]   it comes to gluing things on the board, right?
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.240]   - Yes, okay.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.440]   - So, all right.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.080]   Well, they found this really great picture
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.680]   or they printed off this really great picture or whatever.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.400]   So, okay, I can help cut it and glue it on the board.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.920]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.280]   - You know, and learning the skills of,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.640]   okay, well, you need a table to reflect your data.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.240]   So let me help on the computer.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.560]   Let me show you how to make a table in Microsoft Word.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.680]   - Yes, yes, good.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.840]   Although I will tell you,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.680]   my kids could run circles around me
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.240]   on most of the computer stuff.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.360]   But there are gonna be things,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.720]   like if your student is gonna construct something,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.560]   maybe they're not used to using the power tools
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.440]   by themselves.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   And so that's the kind of help that parents can be,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.880]   driving them somewhere to find supplies
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.720]   or helping them brainstorm an alternate supply
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.280]   that might not be easily procurable.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.120]   - Right, or yeah, getting on the computer.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.360]   Okay, well, how much is this gonna cost?
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.720]   And let's set a budget.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.640]   - Yes.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.600]   - This might be a little more expensive.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.000]   My son was looking at a project.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   He's like, well, mom,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.480]   we're gonna need this type of thermometer
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.760]   and this type of heat lamps.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.520]   And, you know, it sounds like a lot of stuff to buy.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.920]   I'm like, well, yeah, you're right.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.400]   So we need to think about this.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.000]   You know, how are we gonna,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.840]   let's think about our budget and what type of experiment,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.200]   how big can we go on this experiment?
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.040]   - That's really true.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   They sometimes need help in thinking past the immediate,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.480]   make this thing and ask this question,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.160]   what else is involved?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.200]   And so that's really good.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.200]   So let me ask you this, Emily,
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.480]   what are some of the common pitfalls
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.000]   that befall our students?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.120]   What are some common pitfalls to avoid?
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   - Yes, well, so the first one that I am seeing
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.800]   and my family is currently struggling with it right now
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.000]   is coming up with the idea.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.840]   - Oh yeah.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.760]   - I had, you know, my oldest was gung ho about the,
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.400]   yes, let's do science fair.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.120]   He had, you know, five ideas.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.520]   My middle is a much more relaxed kind of kid.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.040]   And he's like, I don't know.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.080]   I don't know what I want to do.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.920]   - Yes.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.760]   - Talking your student through,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   okay, what are your interests?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.920]   And I asked, okay, so when you're,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.320]   when you watch something on YouTube
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.120]   and you find something really interesting,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.920]   what subject matter is that?
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.800]   You know, let's try and narrow this down.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.280]   Another pitfall would be, of course, procrastination.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.200]   They, right now they're thinking it's October, November.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.040]   I don't, this isn't due until January.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.880]   - Oh my word.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.120]   - They forget about Christmas break in there
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.280]   and how they want to do nothing but sit on the couch
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.600]   and drink hot cocoa for two.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.680]   - Yes, or go out and play or watch a movie
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.640]   or do anything that doesn't have anything
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.840]   to do with science fair.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.680]   - Exactly.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.720]   - Travel, travel for family.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.680]   - Exactly.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.720]   And they don't think about the fact that,
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:15.280]   yes, it might only take you 45 minutes
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.080]   to put your board together.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.360]   But that's if you've done all the research
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.080]   and if you've typed up all the results
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.720]   and if you have all the supplies
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.000]   and if you are a fast cutter
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.080]   and if you have a plan, a design plan,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   otherwise it takes you way more than 45 minutes.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:36.920]   - Yeah.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.440]   And something else I've seen too is they start on a project
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.360]   and once they get to the actual experimentation
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.320]   or the background research part,
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.360]   so we're talking a couple of weeks into the project,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.400]   they realized I don't understand
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.040]   what is going on with this project.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.880]   - Oh, yes.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.080]   - I don't understand enough to move forward.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.760]   And so it's making sure at the beginning
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   that your student has a clear understanding of the science,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.120]   not and I'm not saying understand every single aspect
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.960]   of physics or chemistry,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.760]   but enough that they can intelligently speak to a judge
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.560]   on the process and why that happened.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.240]   And so getting too deep into a project
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.680]   where they have to scrap it and start new
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.800]   halfway through December.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.120]   So I've seen that happen.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.720]   - Oh, gosh.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.640]   Okay.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.960]   That is really good advice.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.040]   So what you're basically saying is
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.320]   our students can't just pick something
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   that seems really flashy and exciting to them
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   if they either don't understand the basic science behind it
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.480]   or aren't willing to dig into it to understand it.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.920]   - Yeah.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.960]   In this case, it was a chemistry.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.280]   It was chemistry related.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.720]   And it was mixing this chemical with that chemical.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.360]   And when you do this, this is the reaction that happens.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.560]   And now that he's older, he probably understands it.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.880]   But as a 12 year old Challenge A student,
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.640]   it was way too much.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.360]   And he goes, I don't understand what's happening with this.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.040]   So okay, let's scrap it and try something new.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.880]   - Yeah.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.720]   - Yeah.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.520]   - Parents are very able.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.680]   Parents, your wisdom is very valuable.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.880]   You're not necessarily pouring cold water on your student.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.160]   You're helping your student to consider
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.880]   all the ramifications of their choice.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.240]   Especially if it's something that you know
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   the student doesn't know a lot about in the beginning.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.920]   That doesn't automatically disqualify that as a choice.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   But if your student is not a great self-starter,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.240]   if they are not going to be willing to spend time
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.720]   delving more deeply into the subject,
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.160]   if you have a very busy holiday season coming up,
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.480]   if you don't want to dig in and go elbow deep
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.160]   in this knowledge yourself,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   those are all at least pink flags, if not red flags.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.400]   Those are pink flags to choosing a different project.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.720]   - Right, yeah.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.480]   And that, yeah, so we've already touched
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.760]   on the procrastination.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.120]   And then I think another pitfall is kind of getting bogged
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.760]   down into the minor things.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.600]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.680]   - Like, what color am I going to do my board?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.520]   Or, you know, what's the best arrangement or setup?
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.600]   And so those are not really the things
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.280]   that you need to spend your time on,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.120]   or worry about.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.480]   And that, you know, while having a nice display is,
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.720]   it is important, it's not, you know,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.920]   where you want to butt heads.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.200]   - Yes, exactly, exactly, exactly.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.240]   Okay, so what do I do?
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.800]   I'm a parent, and my student is really
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.080]   not very interested in science.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.960]   And, you know, they would be so thrilled if I said,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.840]   "Yeah, we're just not going to do the science fair.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.520]   Nobody in our family's really into science."
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   Why is the science fair still a really important part
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.760]   of the Challenge A experience?
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.080]   And I want you to answer that,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.520]   but then also give us some good ideas
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.400]   about encouraging students to find something to love
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.600]   about the project.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.400]   - Yeah, so I think, you know, if you have a student
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.160]   who is just not into science fair at all,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.280]   there are so many really just basic experiments
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.760]   that could be done.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.960]   Because I think that the process is what,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.480]   is the goal of science fair.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.080]   It's not the actual experiment.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   It's the learning process is the goal
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.360]   that we have for our students.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.600]   So they can do something as simple as,
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.240]   let me test to make sure water does boil
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.960]   at this particular degree,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.880]   or water doesn't freeze at this one.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.120]   It can be as simple as that.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.440]   But it teaches them to, for one thing,
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   follow through with a project start to finish.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.360]   And I think that follow through that,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.520]   "Hey, I started this with an idea
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.160]   and now look at what I have accomplished."
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.240]   And that gives them such a, that sense of ownership, right?
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.000]   That Challenge A, you know, theme is ownership.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.200]   And so it teaches them, you know,
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.840]   to look at the details of something.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.880]   And I think for some students, it really,
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.200]   it takes that one little bit of curiosity
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.400]   they had on that subject.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.200]   And it really fans that flame.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.920]   And it could turn into something a lot bigger down the road
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   that they may not have nurtured at all until science fair.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.280]   So, you know, you might have like a budding, you know,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.920]   chemist that you would never have known
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.240]   had they not, you know,
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   really dug into that one little project that they did
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.920]   that was chemistry related, you know,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.120]   when they were, you know, 12 years old.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.560]   I just, I so much appreciate several things
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   that you just said that I think it's really beneficial
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.520]   for us as parents to stop and take a deep breath
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.200]   and think about.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   You said that the process is actually more important
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.120]   than the project.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.440]   I think that's really important for us to hear
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   that you are teaching your student
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.680]   about the scientific method.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.120]   You are teaching them how to think well
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.160]   and how to think clearly
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   and how to design a process to answer a question.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:45.840]   That is an awesome ability to inculcate in a child
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.680]   from the time they're 12.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.160]   That's a skill that's gonna pay dividends forever in life.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.520]   - Yeah, and I think that's so important that they,
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.960]   and it teaches them also that time management,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.160]   that that's a really important skill,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.280]   that this is a project that goes on for a couple of months
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.240]   and learning how to take a big picture idea
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.960]   and break it into bite-sized pieces is a life skill.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.800]   - Yes.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   - And they get to do it under the guidance of their parents
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.640]   and with the help of their peers along the way
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   that, you know, they're all working in it together.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.400]   They're all going through the same process.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.720]   And so it really teaches them that,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.000]   okay, this big picture can be broken up into small pieces
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.560]   and let me figure out how to manage my time appropriately.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.640]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.360]   That is great.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.280]   That's a good encouragement for us
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.560]   reluctant science fair parents as well.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.520]   So let me ask you one more really practical question
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.920]   and then I wanna ask you one big,
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.080]   let's go out thinking about this kind of question.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.840]   Here's the practical question.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.600]   Where can parents and students go
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.280]   to find ideas for science fair projects?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   - Yeah, so there's a great website called Science Buddies.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.120]   - Oh, yes.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.960]   - And they have a lot of good ideas
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.280]   and they break it up into a category or like area of science
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.600]   whether it's chemistry, physics, culinary sciences,
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.920]   all sorts of, they break it down into sciences
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.280]   I didn't know were a thing.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.120]   - What?
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.240]   - And also age, grade level
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.440]   and addition to a difficulty level as well.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.280]   So if you have one of those kids that are just like,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.080]   "Meh, I don't wanna do this, mom, why are you making me?"
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.200]   Maybe click on one of the easier ones.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.040]   - Yes, yes.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.520]   - So a student who is like,
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.480]   "Okay, I plan on graduating high school at 15
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.400]   "and starting college at 15 and a half."
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.640]   Then maybe the hard one.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.400]   - Right, right.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.600]   - So that's a really great website.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.720]   But in addition to, I mean,
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.400]   we have such wonderful technology these days.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.160]   I think even if you just Google search
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.920]   seventh grade science project ideas,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.160]   you can get tons of results.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.520]   But I think asking your student the questions,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.280]   okay, what do you find interesting?
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:18.120]   If you were to maybe watch an episode of the Mythbusters,
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.040]   talk about a great show to watch about scientific method,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.840]   by the way, it's amazing.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   My children have learned a lot watching that.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.080]   - Yeah.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.240]   - But it's like, which experiments do they do
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.120]   that you would like to find something similar?
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.080]   Is it more of their chemistry related things
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   or more of their physics related things?
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.840]   Do they have a wide variety?
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.280]   So I've asked my student that,
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   the one who's just hasn't quite settled on an idea yet.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.600]   So we're still on that journey.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.200]   - Yeah, yeah, well, see, that's good to know.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.880]   So everybody, we're all feeling the same pain.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.000]   We all are searching for the project
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.520]   that will pique our students' interest,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.840]   that won't break our family bank,
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.120]   that will keep us all sane.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.800]   I know my daughter did a science fair project
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.160]   about plants and music,
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   and we got really tired of the musical selections.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.960]   She was playing to these two sets of plants.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.200]   You have to count the cost as a family.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.080]   But that's great.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.000]   Thank you for that practical advice.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.440]   And here's my big philosophical, leave us thinking today.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   How does the science fair help us as families
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.480]   incorporate wonder into our homeschooling?
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.360]   - I think it sparks the curiosity.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.120]   It leaves your whole family,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.680]   if you're discussing, okay,
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.040]   what science fair topic am I going to do this year?
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.560]   Or even my daughter,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.480]   who was still in her second year of essential,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.040]   she's already thinking ahead to her challenge A year.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.720]   So as we're sitting around the dinner table
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.360]   thinking about science fair ideas,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   it's giving us all, hey, I wonder what would happen if.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.200]   - I love that.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.600]   - And it's a great discussion for the whole family
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.160]   and to get the bells turning,
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.560]   the wheels turning in our heads
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.840]   and the questions that we're asking.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.360]   And it's a great way to leave us all
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.120]   feeling a little more curious.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.000]   - Yes.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.160]   - I think it's our students have the availability
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.240]   to research far more than I think future
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.560]   or past generations ever have
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.080]   because of the internet and the technology.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.960]   So I think they have the ability
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.640]   to have their questions answered.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.000]   But the science fair really,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.800]   I think just sparks that curiosity.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.080]   - That's really good.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   That is really good.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.720]   And I did see that.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.440]   And so I can attest you are right about that.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.560]   It will start your family on the journey
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.320]   of asking questions together
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.720]   and encourage them to explore together.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.280]   That's really good, Emily.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.000]   Well, listeners, if you are exploring
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.960]   more than just the science fair,
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.480]   if you are a listener who wonders
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.760]   about classical education or families,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   if you have neighbors or relatives or church friends
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.360]   who are wondering what it is that you do
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.000]   when you homeschool your kids
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.720]   and what is classical conversations anyway,
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.240]   you might be a candidate or know a candidate
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.000]   for a community day.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.560]   You might have somebody
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.880]   who would like to come to an open house.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.760]   You can observe a classical conversations community day
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.720]   in action when you come and visit.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.600]   And during that open house,
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.440]   parents and children alike will get some hands-on experience
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.400]   with homeschooling and community.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.960]   Who knows, you may even visit a community
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   who is in the midst of the science fair project
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.880]   and you will get to hear some of the ways
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   that students encourage and refine one another's ideas
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.240]   on community day.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.520]   You can see firsthand what CC Community Day is all about.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.420]   If you wanna find an open house near you,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:24.420]   go to classicalconversations.com/events/
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:32.640]   That's classicalconversations.com/events/
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.240]   Families, I hope that you have been as blessed
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.640]   by the conversation today as I have.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.160]   Emily, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.960]   and your experience about the science fair with us.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.440]   I really appreciate it.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.680]   - Well, thank you for having me.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.840]   I had a great time.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.000]   - So go, families, go and ask good questions
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.080]   and do good experiments and don't blow up the kitchen.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.040]   And I'll see you next week.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.880]   Bye-bye.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.160]   (music fades)
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
