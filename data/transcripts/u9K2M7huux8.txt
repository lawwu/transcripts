[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Well, 2022 has begun, and the start of a new year
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.640]   is always a great time to consider our habits,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.960]   specifically which new habits we wanna start.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.360]   And of course, it's a great time to ask,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.360]   how can God's word abide in me more deeply?
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.280]   What can I do?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.600]   How can I improve here?
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.800]   And the answer, or one of the answers,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.200]   is found in a sermon clip
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.160]   taken from John Piper's sermon,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.760]   If My Words Abide in You, a sermon title,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.560]   taken from Jesus's phrase in John 15, seven.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.640]   The sermon was preached on January 4, 2009,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.040]   13 years ago yesterday.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.200]   It has the new year in view, actually,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.920]   as you will hear in a moment
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   as we jump into the end of that 2009 sermon.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.640]   Here's Pastor John now,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   and he is here talking about Bible holsters.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.960]   Yeah, like a holster for your Bible.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.240]   It'll make sense in a second.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.080]   Have a listen.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.480]   - The Holy Spirit awakens through the word,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   transforms through the word.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.720]   1 Peter 1, 23,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.880]   born again by the Spirit through the living and abiding word.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.360]   John 17, 17, sanctify them in the truth.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.080]   Your word is truth.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.000]   So new birth and sanctification are the work of God,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.160]   not any other way than by the word.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.560]   The word is huge.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.200]   So you need to ask, well, how then does it work?
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.760]   This is the word.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.080]   So, gonna make a little harness,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.520]   sort of like a pistol, the FBI.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.640]   Gonna wear this all day on my heart,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.320]   and I'm gonna walk around.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.520]   Will God sanctify this to me
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   and transform me because I have, I'm carrying it here?
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.760]   What's the answer?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.000]   The answer is no.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.520]   The answer is no.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.480]   Sorry about that.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.600]   We'll talk afterwards.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   You probably have a really good idea in your head
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   what you meant.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.240]   The answer is no,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   because God created you with a brain.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120]   He didn't have to.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   He created you with a consciousness.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   He created you with a will and emotions and thought.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   And the way he ordains for Christ to be magnified
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.960]   through his word is for there to be a connection created
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.760]   with these words and this brain,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.640]   and then this will and this heart.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.160]   If you just try to do this and never read it,
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.560]   never read it, so there's no connection
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.680]   between the meaning of these words and your brain,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.040]   it has zero effect in your life.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.200]   Meditate on the law of the Lord day and night
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.960]   is because a connection is established.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   And by the connection of the meaning of God
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.680]   in his holy word and my construction of that meaning
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   in my brain and its effect on my will and my heart,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.600]   I'm changed by the Holy Spirit's using all that
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   seemingly natural process for our change.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   So my answer to what's all this got to do
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.480]   with memorizing the scripture is this.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.720]   When we memorize the scripture,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.080]   we make that connection between this and this and this
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.680]   more constant, more deep, and more transforming.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   I'll venture this, realistically, nothing can replace it.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   Nothing can replace it, Bible memory,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   in doing what it was designed to do,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.840]   in forging a connection between this and this and this.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.720]   This and this and this.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.520]   Closing testimony from Noel and me.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.080]   On December 21st, we celebrated
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   our 40th wedding anniversary.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   We went away for two days and among other things,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   we read, this is funny, Psalm 40
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.760]   and Isaiah 40.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.280]   We talked.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.240]   We talked about the year and the years.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.640]   So the anniversaries are four, right?
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.800]   Past and future, taking stock,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   regretting, repenting, resolving.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.800]   And we thought back how many times we had sat at a lunch,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   say at Eddington's or Famous Dave's or Leanne's,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   or Leanne Chin or Jimmy John's, this is our style.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.760]   How many times we did our date lunch on Monday
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.680]   and we sat across from each other
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   and rehearsed for a half an hour the pain of the years
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.560]   and the reasons for discouragement now
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.040]   and never once quoted any scripture at all.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   And then we read in Psalm 40, verse five
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   and we paused and we said, we've never done this before.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   We are going to make a verse, our year marriage verse.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.560]   We've never had a year, if we have, I've forgotten it.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.040]   A year marriage verse.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.440]   Psalm 40, verse five.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.560]   We're working on memorizing it and for some reason,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.480]   I'm finding it a tough verse to memorize.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.280]   You have multiplied, O Lord, my God,
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.840]   None can compare with you.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.480]   I will proclaim and tell of them,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.440]   when, yet when I tell of, thank you.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.800]   Say it again.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.440]   Yet they are more than can be told.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.840]   Now, here's the relevance.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.680]   The number of the wondrous deeds of God is uncountable.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.880]   The number of his thoughts toward our marriage,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.040]   his thoughts as our father toward us,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.520]   our children, our grandchildren, our marriage,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.800]   the number of those thoughts is beyond counting.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.400]   And as a husband, now this is a little tiny exhortation
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.200]   here to the men, I believe those lunchtimes
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.840]   of God's silence is my fault.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.880]   The number one responsibility of a husband
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   is to lead with the word of God.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.520]   And when a thousand reasons are being accumulated
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.880]   and moped over for why we are sad,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.240]   it's my job to rise and call down
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.160]   some of the wondrous deeds of God,
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.760]   some of the thoughts of God and proclaim them
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.360]   and tell of them.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.240]   That's what we decided we would do.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.400]   So you can ask us in June or July,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.840]   how's Psalm 40 verse five going?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.200]   Because I went to my little Apple computer
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.960]   and I entered it as a daily reminder
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   for every Monday at 11 a.m.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.800]   In the year.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   You will sink folks, you'll sink in your marriage,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120]   you'll sink in your parenting,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.600]   you'll sink in your singleness,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.960]   you'll sink in your studies if you're a student,
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.880]   you will sink if you only listen to the voices
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.800]   of the circumstances that are giving you problems.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.960]   'Cause they speak so loud
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.680]   and they have nothing good to say.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.720]   And God has, this is a very thick book.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.400]   He has so many wondrous deeds
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.680]   and so many thoughts towards his children,
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.320]   hundreds and hundreds of thoughts towards his children.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.720]   I will proclaim and tell of them,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.640]   yet they are more than can be told.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:26.200]   Well, that's my testimony and our marriage testimony.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   May the Lord make his word dwell richly this year.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.120]   - So good, hearing Noel's voice in this clip
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.000]   is just priceless, I love that.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   This one was sent in from Andrew,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.520]   a listener in Salt Lake City.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.280]   He writes, quote, "I love this clip
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.220]   "as it ties together both scripture, memory, and meditation
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.160]   "and it ties together leading and encouraging your wife
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.800]   "as a husband, amen."
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   Thank you, Andrew.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.480]   And it also ties in the new year too,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.340]   as you heard there at the very end.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.700]   So good, this sermon is titled,
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.440]   "If My Words Abide in You,"
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.320]   Jesus' phrase from John 15, seven.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.240]   It was preached 13 years ago yesterday, on January 4, 2009.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.480]   The full sermon is on DesiringGod's site, as always.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.640]   Thanks for listening.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.760]   Most of our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.400]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons stand out to you
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.680]   and we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.020]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.880]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.360]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.800]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.440]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.100]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:46.400]   Well, why does God hide himself from believers?
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.580]   It's a question we've touched on on the podcast,
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.140]   but we need to address it head on.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.400]   Why does God hide himself from believers?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.240]   We're gonna ask that question next time
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.320]   when Pastor John is back in studio with me on Friday.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.280]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.440]   (upbeat music)
