[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.760]   the Gospel according to St. John in the eighth chapter and in the twelfth verse.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.680]   The twelfth verse in the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:27.280]   Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.160]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:44.680]   Then said Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.480]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.640]   Those who attend here regularly will remember that we began a consideration of this great
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.720]   and mighty statement last Sunday evening.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.080]   I indicated that I was constrained to call attention to it because it is one of those
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.920]   great sayings which, as it were, in and of themselves, give us a summary of the Gospel,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.800]   call attention on the very surface to the salient features and the essential tenets
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.120]   of this, our Christian faith.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   And I indicated further that I am calling attention to it because of the tragic confusion
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.240]   that is so obvious at the present time with regard to the whole meaning of this term "Christian"
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.360]   and as to what the Christian Gospel really is.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.720]   There is nothing that is so obvious about every realm and department of life at the
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.600]   present hour as this whole element of confusion.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.840]   But it is most tragic when there should be confusion with regard to what is really the
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.100]   message of the Christian Church.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.440]   What is the Christian Church to do here in the world?
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.080]   Well, I am here to suggest and to indeed assert, and assert as strongly as I can, that the
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.720]   business of the Gospel and of the preaching of the Church is to hold men and women face
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   to face with this blessed person who said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.800]   The world needs light.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   It does not need your opinions nor mine on politics or international problems or sociological
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   problems.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.240]   We can all give our opinions as everybody else is doing.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.920]   The uniqueness of the Christian Church lies in this, that she has a message to give and
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   to proclaim which none other can give.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.580]   It is a unique message, and it is because we are reminded of that in a striking and
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.840]   in a very forcible manner in this verse that I am calling attention to it.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.080]   Now it is a very grand and a very big statement.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040]   We were only able to touch upon it and deal with it very generally last Sunday evening,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.400]   and we shall not be able to complete it this evening.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   We can simply take stands and look at different aspects of it, and thereby together receive
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.280]   the truth that it enunciates.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.360]   But at any rate, let us remember this.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.240]   Let me repeat this, and I am going to repeat it, God willing, every Sunday night as I deal
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.200]   with this great text.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.720]   It is Christ himself that matters.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.240]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.320]   We have not got a philosophy here.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.240]   We are dealing with a person, and this person is even more important than his teaching.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.320]   There have been many who have borrowed bits of his teaching, but they have never become
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.680]   Christian.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.920]   You can like many things in the sermon and the mountain and in other places without being
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.040]   a Christian.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.000]   What makes a man a Christian is his relationship to this person.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.720]   If we do not know him, our Christian ideas will never save us, nor anybody else.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.920]   It is the person that matters here, "I."
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.560]   Here is one who is always talking about himself.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   Why?
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.960]   Well, because the message is about him.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   And if we are not clear about him, nothing else will matter at all.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.600]   And not only that, you remember, he tells us that it is he alone, "I and I alone."
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:30.360]   That is the real translation of this verse, "I and I alone am the light of the world."
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.200]   And I think I was able to demonstrate that he is entitled to make this statement.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.560]   Greek philosophy had said it is everything before he ever came into this world, but it
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.800]   did not help.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   Roman civilization had exhausted itself; it did not solve the problem.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.520]   All this had happened before he ever came.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   So he stands up and he says, "It is not surprising.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.880]   There is no light anywhere except in me."
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   Now I was constrained to show you last Sunday night how this is true about him if you take
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.880]   the world in general, the whole world situation, as it is this evening.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.280]   And thank God we have got a message here about that.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.040]   It is only the Christian who can understand history.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.400]   It is only the Christian who understands the modern position of the world.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.680]   Everybody else is obviously dumbfounded.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.800]   Statesmen are bewildered.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.200]   The philosophers do not understand it.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.680]   They thought the twentieth century was going to be the greatest century that the world
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.560]   had ever known.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.000]   Everything developing and advancing, knowledge increasing, travel becoming easier.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.040]   Why this twentieth century was to be one of unmixed bliss and happiness and peace.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.120]   The world was to be made paradise once more.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.560]   And yet look at it.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   Look at it tonight.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.880]   No, no, there is no understanding of the times in which we are living except in the light
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.440]   of this person and his message.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.880]   And there is no hope for the future apart from him.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.840]   But here there is a blessed hope.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.200]   He is not finished with this world.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   He will come again and he will rout his every enemy and set up his kingdom.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.300]   And it shall stretch from shore to shore and nothing can prevent the fulfillment of his
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   plan and his purpose.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.720]   Very well, there it is in general.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.960]   But now we have got to descend from the general to the particular.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.760]   Because here we are, we are in this world and we are living in it and we are involved
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.120]   in everything that is happening in it.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.720]   And somebody says, "Well, have you no personal message for me?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.000]   Have you nothing to say to the individual?"
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.080]   Well, thank God I have.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Listen.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.840]   Then speak Jesus again unto them saying, "I am the light of the world."
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:58.600]   Then thank God, he that followeth me, the individual.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   Thank God for a message that reminds us on this day of crowds that God is concerned about
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.800]   the individual.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.360]   This is a world of crowds, isn't it?
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.120]   We are all thinking in the mass and in crowds and in great numbers.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.080]   Thank God for a message that tells me that I matter and that I count.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   He.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   He.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.800]   You see, the message of this gospel is essentially primarily personal, individual.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   And oh, the tragedy that the Church is always talking about politics and about countries
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   and the individual is forgotten.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   And the trouble is in every country that there are so few Christian individuals.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.520]   We don't want to Christianize society, it can't be done.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.160]   What is necessary is that you should add to the number of individual Christians in society.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160]   Then they'll begin to exert their influence.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.800]   Here's the great tragedy of the hour, it seems to me, in the Church as well as in the
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   world.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.640]   That everybody's dealing with this question in a general manner and it avails nothing.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.520]   The statistics are proving that the denominations are going down year by year, one after another.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.480]   Of course, the individual's forgotten.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.320]   And we're all making our great and pompous statements on generalities.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.640]   But here says our Lord, "I am the light of the world."
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:27.840]   Yes, but he, he, the individual, the individual matters, the individual counts.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.240]   Very well, I say, let's come and consider his position and what our Lord has to say
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   with respect to him.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.600]   For it's very clear, isn't it, that there is something tragically wrong.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.720]   Why are we all as individuals as we are?
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.440]   What's the matter with mankind?
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.840]   What's the matter with the race?
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:03.560]   Why are people in such a terrible state and condition that they just have to crowd together
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.680]   to look at nothing, for that's what they're doing, isn't it, today?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.200]   They simply want to see where the crowd was.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.240]   In other words, they're looking at nothing.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.920]   Now what's the matter with people?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.440]   Why do they do this?
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.560]   What's gone wrong with human nature?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.880]   That men and women spend their days and their times in this extraordinary manner, that's
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.120]   the problem that's confronting us.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.520]   It's a very desperate, it's a very solemn, it's a very serious subject.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.800]   And here, of course, is the answer.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.200]   There is only one answer to all this.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.260]   It's the answer that's given in this book from beginning to end.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.240]   It's the answer in this great word that we're looking at tonight.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.760]   Once more it is true to say, he and he alone gives us the light on this matter, on this
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.040]   problem.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.280]   He gives it very clearly.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.880]   And he alone gives it.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.720]   Well what is it?
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.040]   What is the matter?
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.480]   What's the matter with men and women?
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   What's the matter with our society?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.160]   Well I mustn't keep you this evening with the negatives.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   I could do so, because you see they're constantly being put before us.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.560]   The serious thinkers who are not Christians are very concerned, indeed alarmed, about
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   the present state of affairs.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.920]   And they're trying to explain it, trying to deal with the problem.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.340]   So I must just refer in passing to what they're saying.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.860]   Some of them would have us believe, you see, that this is just what they would call a kind
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.360]   of evolutionary lag, that the great process is going on, but that now and again you get
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.840]   this sort of delay, this kind of lag.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.160]   We mustn't be impatient therefore.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.320]   We must realize that man has only just emerged out of the backwoods, and he has a good deal
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.240]   of his bestial past still clinging to him and hanging upon him, and that therefore we
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.000]   must give time.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.200]   Well I mustn't wear you with a refutation of such notions and such ideas, because the
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.080]   very people who hold that are constantly boasting about our great advance and superiority over
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   all who've gone before us, and so on, and how we are rising and developing and improving
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.800]   and so much better than all who've preceded us, I say, well you can't have it both ways.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.000]   But the question is surely at the present time, is there any evidence at all of this
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.180]   advance and development?
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.360]   Can we say that the conditions socially and morally and so on in this country today are
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   better than they were twenty or thirty or forty or fifty years ago?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   What of all these new problems that are rising suddenly?
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:58.160]   The juvenile delinquency and the violence and the theft and the robbery, and all these
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.040]   things that are appearing in our papers.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   No, no, we are aware of a new and an acute moral problem.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.600]   A rot has set in, there's no question about that.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.640]   And the question is, what's it due to?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.760]   It isn't a mere lag, you see, it isn't a failure in the pace of the development of
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   the human race.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.520]   There is a clear retrogression at the moment, and that is the problem that we are confronting.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.080]   So the evolutionary lag doesn't explain it.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.200]   And then others would try to explain it in terms of circumstances and surroundings and
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.320]   conditions and things of that kind.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.740]   This of course is a very old explanation.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:41.640]   You know a hundred years ago the theory was, and they used to propound it with great solemnity,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:49.360]   that the moral state and condition of the people was largely due to their economic circumstances.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   It's a well-known theory.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.600]   They used to say poverty is the cause of crime.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:01.040]   They say you can't expect people to behave decently if they're living in penury and poverty,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.000]   poverty and housing conditions, and, well, the terrible long hours which they have to
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.380]   work.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.480]   Those were the arguments.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.600]   There were the matters of the people, working from early dawn to late at night, no time
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.480]   to read, too weary, not having education as they should have.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.200]   And as I say, living thus on this very line of poverty.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.840]   And we were told that if only we could get rid of these conditions, that the whole situation
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   would be transformed.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.320]   Well, of course, again I mustn't wear you or waste your time, but there was an obvious
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.140]   fallacy to that whole argument even then, a hundred years ago.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.520]   There was no need to wait for today to see how ridiculous it is.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.760]   It could be seen even then, and you could see it like this.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.920]   If sin and vice and crime had then been confined to the east end of London, well, then there
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.280]   would have been a good deal in their theory, in their hypothesis.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.960]   But of course, the actual fact was that exactly the same things were happening in the west
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.320]   end of London.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.120]   In the west end, of course, it was all done in evening dress, not in rags, but the same
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   things were done.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.840]   And you see, then you take this problem of drunkenness.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.440]   We were told it was due to this poverty and so on.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.640]   And yet, you see, if they'd only listened to their own language, they would have noticed
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.320]   that they said that a man was as drunk as a lord.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   Quite so.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.560]   You see, it was wrong even then.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.040]   If you'd only looked round then, you would have seen that you get exactly the same conduct
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.360]   and the same failure and the same breakdown in all classes of society.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.680]   You had the same conduct not only amongst these poor people and who were overworked
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.200]   and who had bad housing conditions.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   You had exactly the same thing in the members of the aristocracy, people who'd been to
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.240]   Oxford or to Cambridge.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.280]   Some of the greatest scandals at the end of the Victorian era were amongst your playwrights
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.640]   and members of the aristocracy and even higher up still, to appear in court over certain
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.000]   matters as you know.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.160]   No, no.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.000]   Even then it was obvious that this was not a matter of circumstances and surroundings
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and conditions.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.200]   But, of course, by today this argument has become quite ridiculous.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.480]   Because if you now read the reports of the meetings of the sociologists and the educationalists,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.240]   and they've been having their conferences recently at the Easter period, you will find
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.800]   that they have got up one after another and have said this.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.980]   They say, "Yes, here is this new moral problem, the recrudescence of things that we thought
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.200]   we'd swept away once and forever."
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.120]   And they say, "What's it due to?"
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.160]   And they say quite seriously and solemnly, "It's due to this.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.120]   The problem is due to the fact that these young people have got too much money."
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.800]   See, a hundred years ago it was because they were poor.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.000]   It's now because they've got too much money.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   What else?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.680]   And they say, "You see, our problem is the problem of leisure.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   That's the trouble.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.320]   People today are not working as hard as before.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.440]   The hours are much shorter and they've got this spare time and they obviously don't
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   know what to do with it."
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.920]   They say, "You know, our urgent problem is what to do with our leisure."
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.880]   A hundred years ago sin was entirely due to the fact that people worked too long and too
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.840]   hard and didn't have sufficient leisure.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.880]   Now the whole thing is due to leisure.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   The same problem.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   Well, there it is.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.640]   I needn't keep you.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:36.800]   I'm simply trying to show you how justified our Lord is when he says, "I, and I alone,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.560]   am the light of the world."
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.320]   You go through all the explanations, I could take you through them, one after another,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.800]   and you would find that it is exactly the same thing.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   No, no, you don't have the explanation of the problem there.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.200]   Well, what is it?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.560]   Here's the answer.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:10.600]   All these problems, all our problems, are due to one thing only, and that is man's
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.040]   wrong relationship to God.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:21.640]   Now that is the case of the whole Bible, from beginning to end.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   And I want to repeat it.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.160]   "Oh, Sir Somdry, you're oversimplifying it."
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.680]   I want to show you that I'm not oversimplifying it.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.920]   This is the literal, simple, actual truth and fact.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.880]   Every single problem that is confronting the ingenuity and the minds of men tonight, whether
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.800]   they're the statesmen or the philosophers or the people who are responsible for local
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.320]   government or your educationalists and sociologists or whatever it is, I say that it is the simplest
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:18:00.960]   thing in the world to prove in every single case that it is due to one thing only, man's
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:07.280]   wrong relationship to God.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.560]   That is the root cause of all our ills.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.240]   Indeed, let me put it like this.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:25.640]   The fundamental trouble is due to our ignorance, our darkness, with respect to God.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:35.680]   "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.720]   have the light of life."
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   What darkness?
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.320]   Oh, the darkness about God.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.840]   You know, if men and women only knew the truth about God, they wouldn't be as they are.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.520]   It is the trouble with every one of us.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.960]   You know, the trouble with the best Christian in this congregation at this moment is his
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.160]   ignorance of God.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.960]   It's the trouble with all of us, ignorance of God.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.160]   People say, "Now, what you need to do is to change your service, improve this or that."
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   No, no.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.320]   If only men and women knew God and had a consciousness of God, all these other things would soon
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.320]   be right.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:21.160]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these other things
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.200]   shall be added unto you."
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Knowledge of God.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.960]   Of course, that's the great theme of the Bible.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.800]   As I say, it's a book about God.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.880]   It's a book to bring us to a knowledge of God.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:42.320]   And this is men's primary and final need.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.640]   Are we aware of this?
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.000]   Well, let us look at society this evening.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.300]   Let's look at men and women.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   What do you find?
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.520]   Well, I see a group that doesn't believe in God at all, that denies his very existence.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.720]   There are men who are delivering their opinions upon the state of affairs in the world, talking
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.880]   to us about the need of abolishing the atomic bomb and so on, that it's immoral to use
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   it.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.920]   One of them was speaking the other day, and speaking very strongly.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.320]   He said this whole notion is immoral.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.960]   That was his term, immoral.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.240]   Now, what about the men who speak like that?
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.880]   Well, that particular man doesn't believe in the being of God.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.280]   There is no God to him.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.200]   It's not surprising, therefore, that his wife divorced him for adultery.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.000]   I pass that by.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.480]   But he talks about the thing being immoral, you see.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.600]   His soul, his righteous soul, is shocked at the thought of using an atomic bomb, a man
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.320]   who can spit upon his marriage vows and be guilty of adultery in a foul manner, and be
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.980]   condemned by a High Court judge for the way in which he'd manipulated it all.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.240]   But he talks about immoral.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   What's the trouble with him?
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.320]   The trouble with him is that he doesn't know God.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.240]   For if he knew God, he'd be silent without going any further.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.880]   He wouldn't use terms such as moral and immoral.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.040]   It's ignorance of God.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.520]   He doesn't believe in the being of God.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.000]   Well, of course, there's nothing new about this, you know.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.400]   There's nothing so pathetic to me as to meet people who rarely think that the hallmark
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.920]   of modernity is to say they don't believe in a God.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.840]   Because if you read your fourteenth psalm and the first verse, you will find that there
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.600]   were people like that in David's time.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.960]   Some three thousand years ago, David was able to say, "The fool hath said in his heart,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.000]   'There is no God.'"
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   They were saying it then.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   They are still saying it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Here are some, you see.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.320]   They look out at the problem of the world and affect a great interest in it.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.560]   But, of course, they don't help us and they can't help us.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   Why?
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.480]   Well, because they're wrong at the center, at the very source of the whole problem.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.280]   Men in his relationship to God, they don't believe in God at all.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.000]   There is no God, you see.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.440]   Let's get rid of all this religion, sob stuff, nonsense, dope of the people, and let's begin
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.520]   to use our minds and our understandings.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:16.120]   They don't believe in God at all.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.080]   But there are others who are in an equally powerless and helpless position, but they
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   don't deny the being of God.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.960]   In fact, they are seeking for God.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.320]   Here is the group that's represented in the Bible by people like the Greek philosophers.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.920]   They were seeking God, if happily they might seek after him and find him.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.880]   That was one of the most pathetic aspects of Greek civilization.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.800]   You remember Paul in Athens looking around the city?
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.840]   He was struck by the multiplicity of temples.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.360]   God of war, God of peace, God of love.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.040]   All these temples to the various gods and the people crowding in and offering up their
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   sacrifices.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.680]   The most extraordinary thing I found in the city was a temple with this extraordinary
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.160]   inscription of "to the unknown God."
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   What did that mean?
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.440]   Well, it meant this, you see.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.880]   They said, "We've covered all the gods, the God that causes war, the God that can give
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.760]   us peace, the God that controls love, and all these other things."
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.240]   And yet, having built the temples to all their gods, they had an uncomfortable feeling in
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.460]   them.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:36.560]   They said to themselves, "There still seems to be another God, and he seems to be the
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.680]   most powerful God of all.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   When we've pleased and placated all our gods, this other God seems to be acting and upsetting
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   everything.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   Who is he?"
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Well, they said, "We don't know."
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   "Well, let's put up a temple to him."
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.280]   "Well, to whom shall we say we're putting it up?"
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.520]   "Let's say to the unknown God."
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.720]   And they were trying to find him.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.320]   They were trying to seek him.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.220]   With all their thinking and philosophy, they made tremendous advances, but they never got
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.220]   there.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.220]   They never found him.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:11.300]   So the apostle Paul is able to say, quite literally, in truth, "The world, by wisdom,
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.820]   knew not God."
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.620]   They could talk about the absolute and the eternal.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:23.040]   They could manipulate their arguments, but it didn't bring them to a knowledge of God.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.060]   Even subsequent philosophers have just been repeating all this.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.340]   You see, the philosophers come along and they give their proofs of God.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   They say, "There is a result.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.580]   Well, there must be some cause."
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.060]   That's it.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.140]   Nothing happens without a cause.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.140]   "The pages of this Bible have been turned over."
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.700]   Yes, well, somebody must have done it.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.380]   The effect leads back to cause.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.980]   And they say, "If you go back and back and back, there must be an uncaused cause somewhere."
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.180]   That's God reasoning it out, you see.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.900]   The argument from creation, the argument from design.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.540]   Now, I'm not here to say that there is no value in these arguments.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.340]   I believe there is very real value in them.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.980]   But I am here to say this, that all of them together will never bring men to a knowledge
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   of God.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.300]   They can bring you to a knowledge of the absolute.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.980]   They can bring you to a knowledge of some great uncaused cause, some great original.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.260]   But that's not to know God.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.420]   And that, in the last analysis, you see, doesn't help you, because it leaves you yourself in
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:30.620]   control and you have to manipulate your categories and your concepts and your thoughts.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:36.220]   You are doing everything and you don't know this God whom you feel could help you if only
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:41.060]   you could find him and only come to a true knowledge of him.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.500]   And that is the position of so many in the world tonight.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.820]   They talk about God, but what is this God of theirs?
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.180]   Well, the way they put it is this, and it tells us all about their God.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.020]   The man says, "What I say is this, what I think is this."
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.020]   And his God is as he thinks.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.940]   And his God is one who is only love, nothing else.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.660]   He says, "I can't conceive of a God doing this or thinking that."
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.180]   And because he can't conceive of it, he says, "God doesn't."
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.580]   And he talks about God and about worshipping God.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.580]   What's he doing?
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.660]   He's doing nothing but worshipping his own thoughts.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.460]   He's worshipping some projection of his own feeling.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.820]   "You know, I have it in me," says the man, "I've got a fundamental feeling, you know,
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.900]   that there must be at the back somebody or something and he's like this and that."
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.620]   But that's all coming out of the man.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:41.660]   And men disagree and differ in their feelings and in their thoughts and in their projections.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:47.180]   In other words, my dear friends, we'll come back to this once more.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.940]   If you tonight are seeking for God, if you've got a feeling within you that the answer is
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:27:00.620]   in God after all, if you see the failure of every human ingenuity and every human organization,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.900]   and if you're beginning to say, "Why, the answer must be in God," and the question is,
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.900]   "How are we to know God?"
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:15.660]   Well, I say the first step you have to take is to realize that along this line of human
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:22.460]   effort and endeavor and human seeking, you will never succeed.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:28.260]   And to me, the tragic thing is that anybody ever tries to go along that road, if a man
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:34.060]   tells me that he in this way is trying to find God by means of his thinking and his
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.700]   philosophy, I know that that man is already wrong.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.700]   Why?
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:50.140]   Surely, he ought to start by saying this, "If God is God, well then obviously he is
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:56.260]   so altogether above me that my mind can't encompass him.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:04.740]   If I believe in God, in one who is above and outside and beyond everything, can I claim
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:11.340]   to understand and to determine the nature, character, and being and conduct of such a
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   God?"
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.900]   I say that a man who tells me that he's setting out with his own mind to discover
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:22.860]   and to know and to understand God is a man who's contradicting himself.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.820]   God is in heaven, we are on earth.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.500]   I mean by that that by definition, if you use the term God at all, you are thinking
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:37.220]   of someone who is altogether outside the reach and the ambit and the scope of the mind
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:55.820]   of man.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:05.740]   Because God is God and what he is, man's seeking and searching can never be enough.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.180]   If you want a second reason, it's this.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:17.540]   Along that line, you'll never know God because man is as he is, and he's not only finite,
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.740]   but he's sinful.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.820]   He doesn't understand himself, leave alone God.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.780]   He doesn't understand his world, leave alone God.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.420]   He doesn't understand his fellows, leave alone God.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.940]   By definition, the whole thing is impossible.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.500]   Very well then, you see it's because of this that our blessed Lord stood there before those
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:50.660]   people and said unto them again, "I, and I alone, am the light of the world.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:56.860]   I am," he says, "the only light upon God."
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.500]   My dear friend, if you and I are to know God, there's only one way.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.220]   God must reveal himself.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.300]   Man cannot arrive at him.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.940]   Can a man by searching find out God, says Job?
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940]   What a wonderful question.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.540]   Oh, that man had paid heed to his question.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.120]   There is a man at the dawn of history, you'd seen it, you see.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.380]   Can a man by searching find out God?
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   Of course he can't.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.180]   He'd be equal to God if he could.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   Quite right, says Paul.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.220]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.180]   Very well, is there no hope for us?
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   There is.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:39.260]   It was when the world by wisdom knew not God that it pleased God by the foolishness of
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.900]   the thing preached to save them that believe.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.900]   What does that mean?
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:49.720]   Here comes in this great idea, this great category, you see, of revelation.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.520]   By speculation you'll never know God.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.920]   There is only one way of knowing God, and that is that God should graciously be pleased
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   to reveal himself.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.380]   And the message of Christianity is that he's done that.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:09.520]   This is Christianity, to say that this everlasting and eternal God has been pleased to reveal
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:19.200]   himself, to show himself, to manifest himself, and supremely in this blessed person here
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:27.080]   called Jesus of Nazareth, who stood up and who said, "I and I alone am the light of
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.360]   the world."
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.080]   This is the message.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   What does it mean?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.320]   Well, you see, it means this.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.480]   God has revealed and manifested himself in many ways.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.200]   Yes, he is to be found in nature.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.680]   You can't explain nature apart from God.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.920]   You can't explain many of the most glorious things in life apart from God.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.640]   He has revealed himself in those ways, in history, in providence.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.440]   Oh, but we needn't stay there, we needn't stay or spend our time in the vestibule.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.240]   Let's enter into the very center, into the glorious chamber itself.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:10.920]   And there we are confronted by this person.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.480]   If you want to know God, says Jesus Christ, come to me.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.640]   I am the light.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.240]   I will give you the light about God.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.280]   Now then, you remember these passages we read at the beginning.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   I called your attention to them in order that we might underline what he says here.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.040]   He keeps on saying the same thing right through this Gospel of John.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.200]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:46.760]   The only begotten God, as some would translate it, that is in the bosom of the Father, he
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.280]   hath declared him.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.080]   Why did the Son of God come into this world?
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.600]   To reveal God.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.920]   To declare him.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.240]   To lead him out, as it were.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.440]   To manifest him.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.960]   To teach us about him.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.800]   He and he alone does this.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.120]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.280]   Be careful as you speak about God.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.320]   Poor Job had done a lot of talking about God, hadn't he?
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.360]   He'd been arguing with his friends, you see.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.160]   And they'd been engaged in a theological and religious discussion, as we all have done
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.760]   so many times and which we've enjoyed so much.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.080]   And we've said, "I say this, I think that," says the other man, "what God is like."
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.440]   And they've all been talking about God as Job, but God revealed himself to Job.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.560]   And what did Job do?
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.920]   He put his hand upon his mouth.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   He kept silent.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.560]   He felt he was a fool.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   He'd been talking about God.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.280]   He says, "I'd heard of thee with the hearing of the ear, but now mine eyes seeth thee."
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.380]   And he felt unworthy.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.840]   He became speechless.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   He dare not go further.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.440]   Why, oh, he'd now seen God.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.640]   In that sense of the vision, God manifested himself to him in a very dim way.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.560]   But here is the statement of our Lord himself in so many different manners.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.720]   "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.720]   And it's a simple fact.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.160]   Did you notice how he repeated all that to Nicodemus?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   And it's significant that it was to a man like Nicodemus that he said these things.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.600]   Nicodemus, you see, is a religious expert.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   He is a Pharisee.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.880]   He is a teacher in Israel.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.360]   He is a very learned man.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.040]   He is a very good man.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.800]   And yet it is to him our Lord says these things, "Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   not these things?
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:31.160]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know."
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.960]   You see, Nicodemus, you don't know.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.900]   You know a great deal more than the people.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.680]   But when you come to these matters, you don't know.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:47.400]   "I'm speaking," says Christ, "what we do know, and testify that which we have seen."
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   You haven't seen Nicodemus.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.280]   "If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   you of heavenly things?"
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:03.840]   Then listen, "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.000]   even the Son of Man that is in heaven."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.920]   What does he mean by all this?
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.880]   What he's saying is this, you see.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.080]   Nicodemus, stop trying to understand.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.200]   Stop trying to argue.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.480]   You don't know.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.960]   You haven't seen.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.640]   Nicodemus, you've never been able to ascend into heaven, have you?
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.920]   And to see God.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.560]   You can't give a report to me or to anybody else as to what things are really like there,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.620]   what God is like, what heaven is like.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.880]   But you know, Nicodemus, he says, "I can.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.920]   Man which is in heaven."
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.400]   Here is one, you see, who speaks with authority.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:02.520]   What I read about him is this, "The same was in the beginning with God," which some say
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:09.280]   should be translated like this, "The same was face to face with God."
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.740]   Oh, this is what makes his message unique.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.800]   That is why he's entitled to say that he and he alone is the light of the world, that he
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.440]   and he alone can give us light, the light that we need about God.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.320]   My dear friend, while you and I may speculate and listen to the authorities doing the same
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:31.000]   and be at the end where we were at the beginning, here is one who says, "Listen to me."
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Why?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.680]   "Well, because I have looked into the face of my Father.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   I know Him.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.720]   I have come from Him.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.520]   I am in His bosom at this moment, resting upon it.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.240]   I am with Him in heaven, though I am speaking on earth.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   Listen to me.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:52.960]   I am the light of the world, and there is no other."
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   That's what he's telling us.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.560]   It's not surprising that in the epistle to the Hebrews you find him put into a category
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.560]   on his own.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:10.800]   "God in the times past speak in divers manners, portions, parts to our fathers through the
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   prophets.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.040]   All right, it's of God, it's wonderful, thank God for it.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:25.080]   Believe it all, but don't say there, that in these last days spoken unto us in His Son,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.680]   who is the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person."
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.080]   "I am the light of the world," says this one.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:38.000]   "That's why I'm not interested in Hinduism or in Mohammedanism or in any otherism.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I don't want them.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.880]   Here is the brightness of the Father's glory.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   Here is the effulgence of the everlasting.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   Here is the Son.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.520]   Here is one who has looked into the face of God and comes and gives me a report.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   I want no other.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.040]   There is no other."
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.720]   That is why he said in the fourteenth chapter of this Gospel, according to St. John in verse
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.040]   six, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.160]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.620]   You can arrive at the absolute without Him, but you haven't arrived at a person.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.600]   You can arrive at your philosophic ex.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.960]   You can arrive at the great uncaused cause.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:22.920]   No man cometh to the Father but by me.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.720]   And it's a Father we need.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   We are lost.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   We are helpless.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.280]   We are forlorn.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.680]   And we need someone to enfold us in His blessed arms.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.960]   A Father.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.480]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.720]   But here is one who has come from Him, not only greater than the prophets, greater than
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.480]   Moses the lawgiver, greater than Aaron the great high priest, greater than the angels
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.080]   who are but ministering spirits.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   My dear friend, what the world needs to know tonight is this, that the Son of God has been
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.120]   into this world.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:07.280]   He has the answer to the problems, that God has sent down His own Son, His own likeness.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.120]   He and He alone can give us light about God.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   And this is the light the world needs this evening.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.960]   What is the light He gives us?
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.520]   Well, He tells us that God is the Creator.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.120]   There is a great deal here about the almighty power of God.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   This world has not evolved from nothing.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   No, no, in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and all that in them is.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.520]   God, the Creator.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.840]   This world has not been made by men, you know.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   Let's not be fooled, because men can make these bombs, let's not be fooled into thinking
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.520]   they can make a world.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.400]   No, no.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.840]   God made it all, men included.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:03.360]   There is no limit to His power, no limit to His might.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.560]   But you know those are not the only truths about God.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.800]   Look at the revelation that is given of His majesty, of His glory.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:20.080]   Watch the way in which this person who claims to be His Son speaks about Him.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.160]   Listen to Him as He tells us about the holiness of God.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:30.520]   When He prays He says, "Holy Father."
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.720]   Listen to Him again, He is teaching men to pray.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.920]   He says, "Our Father," and then lest you think that He is a modern indulgent father who winks
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.800]   at all that is wrong and says, "It doesn't matter, forget it all, everything is all right
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   at the end, no justice, no punishment."
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:51.920]   "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:41:00.440]   Holy, just, righteous.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:09.360]   That's what He tells us about God, that He is a God who hates sin, He is a God who hates
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.760]   rebellion, He is a God who hates everything that has made such havoc of His beautiful,
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   glorious universe that having made it He looked at it and said He saw it was good, it was
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.560]   called paradise.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:26.400]   God hates this other thing that has come in and has turned it into the shambles that you
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.320]   and I know.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.000]   God hates evil.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.680]   He is a holy God.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.320]   He is a righteous God.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.360]   He is a just God.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.920]   I am not speculating about the character and the attributes of God, I am simply telling
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.800]   you what has been revealed, what God has revealed about Himself, what the Son of God, this man
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.360]   who says, "I am the light of the world," what He says about the Father, the light He
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.520]   gives us on the Father, He has declared Him, He has looked into His face, He has come down
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.120]   to tell us about Him, He is in heaven.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Listen to Him.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.920]   That's what He tells you about God.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:10.660]   He tells you further that God is the judge of all the earth, and that the whole of mankind
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.920]   will have to appear before Him in judgment.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ who taught that, that He is a God who will punish transgression.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.360]   The moderns don't believe the Old Testament; Jesus Christ did believe it.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.200]   He said that not a jot or a tittle should pass from the law or the prophets until all
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.160]   should be fulfilled.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.720]   If you choose to listen to a man calling himself a Christian, who says he doesn't believe in
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.040]   the God of the Old Testament, well, I am sorry, I can't stop you, I can't help you.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:48.000]   I am simply here to tell you that this blessed person who says, "I know Him because I have
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   come from Him," he believed the Old Testament about God.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.400]   God will punish the transgressor.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.000]   God is of such a pure countenance that He cannot look upon sin.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.600]   The way of the transgressor is hard, He says.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.280]   He told men at the beginning that if he sinned, that dying he should die, and he did die.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.160]   It was God who turned men out of paradise.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.680]   It is God who gave the Ten Commandments, and all that has been added, that is added to
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.320]   them by the way of indication of punishment, that is to follow transgression.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.800]   This is all God, and Christ says, "I have not come to do away.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.480]   Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:38.280]   I came not to destroy, but to fulfill."
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.520]   That is what He tells us about God.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:50.560]   And surely this is the supreme need of the world this evening.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.720]   Men and women are living as if there were no God.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.960]   Each man is his own authority, does what he wants, does what he chooses.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.880]   If he wants a thing, why not?
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.960]   He does not see why he should not enter into another man's married life.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.400]   If he covets that man's wife, why should he not?
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.800]   If he wants it, why should he not have it?
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.440]   That is the argument, is it not, today?
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.880]   Are we not face to face with lawlessness, running right through life from top to bottom,
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.080]   people taking the law into their own hands, acting independently?
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.800]   What I want, that is right, and I must have it.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.760]   All our problems, you know, are due to the fact that men and women do not believe in
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   God.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:34.320]   It is because they do not believe in God, they do not observe His day, and they are
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.360]   turning a Sabbath into a fairground.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.280]   It is nothing but the fact that they do not believe in God.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.160]   You know, it is rather tragic, is it not?
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   Why are men and women seeking for some new excitement, some new thrill, something to
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.480]   look at, something to talk about?
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.840]   You know why it is?
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.680]   Because they have got nothing worth looking at, nothing to be interested in.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.360]   They do not know God.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.440]   See, they see nothing in this book.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   They do not know what it is to pray, and to talk to the living God, and to hear His answers,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.760]   and to have traffic with the eternal.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.160]   "Oh, I am not condemning these poor people.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   God forbid that anybody should misunderstand me.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.520]   What I am worried about is that my heart is not breaking more than it is for these poor
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.160]   people who are wandering aimlessly as sheep without a shepherd."
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   You know, their trouble is that they do not know about God, and they are seeking thrills
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   which they cannot find.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.920]   It is because they do not know God.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.000]   They do not know about Him even, and they do not know Him, and they do not know what
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   they are doing.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.920]   They do not know the fate that is awaiting them.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   They do not know where they are going.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.240]   It is this appalling ignorance of God.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.280]   It is the cause of all our troubles and problems.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.480]   If only everybody in the world knew tonight that he or she not only has got to die, but
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.440]   afterwards stand before this God in judgment.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:04.360]   If only men and women realized that, you know, the whole situation would be entirely changed.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   If we only knew that when we die we stand before that God, and our eternal destiny is
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.280]   determined by our relationship to Him and our obedience to Him.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.600]   Think of the things you would stop doing.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   Think of how your life would be changed.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.320]   Well, our Lord says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.640]   I alone can tell you the truth about God, and that is the truth about God.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.000]   And there He holds it before us.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.180]   But thank God He does not stop at that.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.080]   But let us be clear about this.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:43.160]   God is everlastingly just and holy and righteous.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.920]   God is a God of wrath against sin.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:55.200]   "I am the light of the world," He says, and He means this.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:01.440]   That is the truth about God, but it is not the whole truth about God.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.720]   "I am the light of the world.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.840]   I have come from Him."
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.800]   Well, what are you doing in this world?
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:13.920]   Oh, He says, "I am in this world to tell you also that while all that is true about
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:21.040]   God, God is also love and grace and mercy and compassion."
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:31.760]   "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:36.440]   Me should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   He says, "I am the light of the world.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.240]   What you need is to know God, and listen to Me," He says, "I'll tell you, and I alone
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.560]   can tell you about God."
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:52.400]   And so He puts it like this, "He who hath seen Me hath seen the Father."
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   Would you like to know God?
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.160]   Would you like to come under God's blessing?
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.880]   Do you see that this is your supreme need?
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.120]   Well, you say, "What is it like?"
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.160]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.200]   Look at this person.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   Look at Jesus Christ.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.880]   "He who hath seen Me hath seen the Father."
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.560]   Well, look at Him and what do you see?
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.080]   Well, this is what I see.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   Compassion.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.960]   Our Lord, you see, looked out upon men and women in Jerusalem very much as you and I
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.000]   look upon these poor crowds of people in this city today.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And what did He say?
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.760]   He saw them as sheep without a shepherd, and He felt sorry for them.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.360]   He had compassion upon them.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.880]   He says, "They're at the mercy of the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.000]   There's nobody to protect them.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   There's nobody to give them food.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   They want a shepherd.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I've come into the world because of that."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.740]   He had an eye of compassion.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.240]   He never passed the case of suffering, you know.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.520]   You see Him one afternoon crowded by a great throng of people.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.520]   He was on His way to heal the daughter of Jairus, but here He is thronged by such a
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.480]   crowd He could scarcely move.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.920]   Suddenly He felt something was tugging at the back of His gown, and there was a poor
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.400]   woman with a desperate and terrible need just touched the hem of His garment.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   He didn't brush her aside.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   He didn't say, "I'm too busy.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   I must get on."
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   No, no, He stopped.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   He dealt with her.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Why?
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.640]   Well, though He's the light of the world, He says, "He, the individual, He was aware
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.600]   of this one woman in the thronging mob and mass."
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.720]   And this is the marvelous thing to me.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.320]   He tells us that God is like that.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.040]   The God who said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.800]   Is a God who's interested in the humblest individual?
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.640]   Are we, of course, in our cleverness?
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.080]   We are only interested in the world situation.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.520]   We don't like a personal individualistic evangelistic gospel.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   No, no.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.720]   We want world statements.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.240]   We want to know what a man thinks about South Africa, or about bombs, or the big things,
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.800]   the great world situation.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.600]   Thank God that God isn't like us.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.880]   "He that believeth in me."
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.240]   Who touched my garment?
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.160]   He's interested in the individual.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.920]   And though He's there on the cross on Calvary's Hill, bearing the load of the guilt of the
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   world's sin, He's got time to talk to this poor thief on His left hand who asks Him a
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   question.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.320]   He ministers to him in his agony.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.000]   "Oh," He says, "he who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.520]   Yes, and what you see is compassion and tenderness and longsuffering.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.480]   Yes, you see the publicans and sinners drew nigh unto Him.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.000]   And the Pharisees were shocked and appalled.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Fancy receiving such people, but He did receive them.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.600]   The harlots, the prostitutes, they came to Him.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.480]   He allowed one of them to wash his feet with her tears and to wipe it with her hair.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.040]   That's what God is like, He says.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:58.440]   "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father, a God of love, a God of mercy, a God of tenderness,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:04.760]   compassion, longsuffering, a God that though the whole universe is of nothing to Him and
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:13.000]   He can live without it, He is nevertheless prepared to look at us one by one.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.280]   He's interested in us one by one.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.600]   And if we believe in Him and give ourselves to Him and belong to Him, He assures us that
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.880]   the very hairs of our head are all numbered."
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:29.560]   Thank God for this light.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:35.880]   I don't find the absolute of great help to me when I'm tempted sorely or when I sin or
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.800]   when I'm lying on my deathbed.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.240]   Don't talk to me about an absolute.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.640]   I want someone.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:46.680]   I want a person.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:54.200]   And the whole world needs to know God.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.560]   And you'll never know God except in Jesus Christ.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:09.320]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me, but thank God by him you can find him.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.120]   You can know God.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.280]   You can know your sins forgiven.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.780]   You can know yourself accepted in the beloved, adopted into the family of God, become a child
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.640]   of God and an heir of eternal bliss.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.320]   You'll have, as I said last Sunday, a new understanding of time and of eternity.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.920]   You will be given a new strength and power.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:39.400]   You'll be given the very light of life itself, and blessings beyond your imagination will
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:45.880]   begin to flow to you.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:51.160]   Have you seen, my friend, that your need is the need of God?
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:59.960]   To know God, to realize the truth about him.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:07.480]   The terrible need of him, the appalling result if you don't know him, and the way in his
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:16.160]   infinite compassion and grace and mercy that he has devised and provided to bring us to
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.400]   that blessed knowledge.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:23.960]   I and I alone am the light of the world.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.040]   He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:37.080]   No, no, he'll walk in the light of God, in the light of life, in the light of glory,
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.840]   in the light of heaven.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.440]   My dear friend, make certain that you're in it.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   Are you in the light?
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   Have you come to the light?
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.520]   Come this evening, just as you are, publican, prostitute, whatever you may be, great philosopher
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.080]   like Nicodemus, religious expert, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.280]   Realize you're blind.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.620]   Do you know God?
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.920]   Is God real to you?
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.520]   Your talk about him will be of no value if you don't know him.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:10.360]   This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   whom thou hast sent.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.480]   Turn to Jesus Christ.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   Look at him.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.320]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   Follow him.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   He'll bring you to the Father.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:31.020]   And having seen him, everything will be different, life, death, time, eternity, men, God, everything.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:43.780]   Turn to the light and begin to bask in it and to follow its gentle, its glorious leading.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.700]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
