[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Well, happy Wednesday and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.200]   We talk a lot about this thing called Christian hedonism around here.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   So what is it?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.600]   What's the best, simplest, shortest definition of Christian hedonism?
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.200]   Well, I have it for you today.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.620]   Back in 2006, Pastor John was asked to define Christian hedonism in two minutes.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.200]   And he delivered his response in one minute, 40 seconds, short of two minutes.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   When he was asked the question, here's what he said.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   Christian hedonism is the conviction that God is most glorified in us when we are most
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.760]   satisfied in him.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.800]   I won't take the time to put all the textual foundation under that.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.520]   I've done that in many places.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.600]   But let me explain the implication.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.640]   If God is made to look glorious by my being satisfied in him, then pursuing my satisfaction
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.320]   in him becomes essential to obedience and worship.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.680]   And therefore, Christian hedonism says you must pursue your maximum joy.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.160]   And maximum in two senses.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.280]   Maximum in quality, maximum in quantity.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.000]   In other words, I want fullness of joy and I want joy forevermore.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.920]   That's from Psalm 1611.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.040]   And that's only found in God.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.760]   So I have no hesitation saying the Christian life is the pursuit of maximum joy in God.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   Because my soul is satisfied and God is glorified.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   And those two things, God's glory and my joy, are not at odds.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.360]   And that's the beauty of Christian hedonism.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.160]   God has sent Jesus Christ to die for my sins, to rise again, so that it's possible for me
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.520]   now to have total and complete satisfaction in God forever.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.060]   And when I pursue that, I'm showing that God is infinitely valuable, infinitely satisfying,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.840]   so that he gets the glory and I get the joy.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.960]   Short, sweet, and profound.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.880]   And it will take a lifetime to appreciate what that actually means.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.640]   It will actually take an eternity to really experience this, that we seek our maximum
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.600]   joy in quality and in quantity in God forever.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.640]   And when we find God to be infinitely valuable, infinitely satisfying to us, he gets the most
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.840]   glory from us.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.440]   And we find our supreme joy in him.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.920]   That's what we're all about here at Desiring God.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.960]   Our eternal joy in God's eternal glory.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   In unison.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In unison.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.520]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.920]   We'll rejoin the studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.420]   We'll see you then.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.420]   [END]
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420]   [END]
