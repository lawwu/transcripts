[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   you were at Microsoft and at some point you realized that GitHub is very valuable and worth
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.360]   acquiring. How did you realize that? And how did you convince Microsoft to purchase GitHub?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.720]   Well, so I had started a company called Xamarin together with Miguel de Caza and Joseph Hill,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.080]   and we had built kind of mobile tools and platforms. And Microsoft acquired the company in
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.880]   2016. And I was excited about that. I thought it was great. But to be honest, I didn't actually
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.800]   expect or plan to spend, you know, more than a kind of a year or so there. But when I got in
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.680]   there, I got exposed to what Satya was doing and just the quality of his leadership team. I was
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.240]   really impressed. And actually, I think I saw him in the first week or so I was there and he asked
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.600]   me, "What do you think we should do at Microsoft?" And I said, "I think we should buy GitHub."
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.440]   When would this have been?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760]   This was like my first week. It was like March or April of 2016.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.480]   Okay.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.040]   And then he said, "Yeah, it's a good idea. We thought about it. I'm not sure we can get away
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   with it," or something like that. And then it was about a year later, a little more than a year
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.480]   later, yeah, I wrote him an email, just a memo. You know, I sort of said like, "I think it's time
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.120]   to do this." There was some noise that Google was sniffing around. I think that may have been
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.520]   manufactured by the GitHub team. But it was a good catalyst because it was something I thought made
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.960]   a lot of sense for Microsoft to do anyway. And so I wrote an email to Satya, sort of a little memo
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.920]   saying, "Hey, I think we should buy GitHub. Here's why. Here's what we should do with it."
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.600]   And the basic argument was developers are making IT purchasing decisions now. It used to be this
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.880]   sort of IT thing, and now developers are leading that purchase. And it's this sort of major shift
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.200]   in how software products are acquired. And Microsoft really was an IT company. It was not a
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.840]   developer company in the way most of its purchases were made, but it was founded as a developer
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.920]   company, right? And so Microsoft's first product was a programming language. Yeah, I said, "Look,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   the challenge that we have is there's an entire new generation of developers who have no affinity
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.120]   with Microsoft. And the largest collection of them is at GitHub. And if we acquire this and we do
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.080]   a merely competent job of running it, we can earn the right to be considered by these developers
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.560]   for all the other products that we do." And to my surprise, Satya replied in like six or seven
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.800]   minutes and said, "I think this is very good thinking. Let's meet next week or so and talk
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.240]   about it." And I ended up at this conference room with him and Amy Hood and Scott Guthrie and Kevin
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   Scott and several other people. And they said, "Okay, tell us what you're thinking." And I kind
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   of did a little 20-minute ramble on it. And Satya said, "Yeah, I think we should do it. And why don't
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   we run it independently like LinkedIn? Nat, you'll be the CEO." And he said, "Do you think we can get
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.880]   it for two billion?" And I said, "We could try." And three weeks later, he said, "Okay, go do this,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.360]   Scott. Scott will support you on this." Three weeks later, we had a signed term sheet and an
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.600]   announced deal. And then it was an amazing experience for me. I'd been there less than
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.320]   two years. And Microsoft was made up of and run by a lot of people who'd been there for many years.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.400]   And they trusted me with this really big project and made me feel really good to be trusted and
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   empowered. And I had grown up in the open source world. And so for me to get an opportunity to run
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.280]   GitHub, it's like, I don't know, getting appointed mayor of your hometown or something like that.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.400]   It felt cool. And I really wanted to do a good job for developers. And so that's how it happened.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   That's actually one of the things I want to ask you about. Because often when something succeeds,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   we kind of think it was inevitable that it would succeed. But at the time, I remember,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.720]   I mean, it was a while back, but I remember that there was a huge amount of skepticism. I would go
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   on Hacker News and the top thing would be a blog post about how Microsoft's going to mess up GitHub.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.040]   And I guess those concerns have been alleviated throughout the years. But how did you deal with
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   that skepticism and deal with that distrust? Well, I was really paranoid about it. And I
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   really cared about what developers thought. I think there's always this question of who
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.440]   are you performing for? Who do you actually really care about? Who's the audience that's in your head
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.240]   that you're trying to do a good job for, impress, earn the respect of, whatever it is. And though I
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:23.280]   love Microsoft and care a lot about Satya and everyone there, I really cared about the developers.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.320]   I'd grown up in this open source world. And so for me to do a bad job with this central institution
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.920]   and open source would have been a devastating feeling for me. It was very important to me not
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.760]   to. So that was sort of the first thing is just that I cared. And then the second thing is that
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.280]   the deal leaked. It was going to be announced, I think, on a Monday. It leaked on a Friday.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.360]   And Microsoft's buying GitHub. And the whole weekend, there were terrible posts online,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.840]   people saying, we've got to evacuate GitHub as quickly as possible. And we're like, oh my god,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.160]   that's terrible. And then Monday, we put the announcement out. And we said, we're acquiring
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.120]   GitHub. It's going to run as an independent company. And then it said, Nat Friedman's going
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   to be CEO. And I had-- I don't want to overstate or whatever. But I think a couple people were like,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   oh, Nat comes from open source. He spent some time in open source. And it's going to be run
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   independently. So I don't think they were really that calmed down. But at least a few people
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.240]   thought, oh, maybe I'll give this a few months and just see what happens before I migrate off.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:30.160]   And then my first day as CEO after we got the deal closed, 9 AM the first day, I was in this room.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   And we got on Zoom and all the heads of engineering and product. And I think maybe-- I don't know what
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.800]   people were expecting. But I think maybe they were expecting some kind of longer-term strategy
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.480]   or something. But I came in. And I said, there was this GitHub had no official feedback mechanism
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   that was publicly available. But there was several GitHub repos that community members had started.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   Isaac from NPM had started one where he'd just been allowing people to give GitHub feedback.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.760]   And people had been voting on this stuff for years. And I shared my screen and put that up,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.280]   sorted by votes, and said, we're going to pick one thing from this list and fix it by the end
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.720]   of the day and ship that, just one thing. And I think people were like, this is the new CEO
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.800]   strategy. And they were like, I don't know. You have to do database migrations. You can't do that
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.640]   in a day. And then someone's like, well, maybe we can do this. We actually have a half implementation
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.520]   of this. And we eventually found something that we could fix by the end of the day.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.720]   And what I'm thinking is-- what I'm thinking, what I hope I said was, what we need to show
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.640]   the world is that GitHub cares about developers, not that it cares about Microsoft. If the first
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   thing we did after the acquisition was to add Skype integration, developers would have said, oh,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.640]   we're not your priority. You have new priorities now. And so the idea was just to find ways to
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   make it better for the people who use it and have them see that we cared about that immediately.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.840]   And so I said, we're going to do this today. And then we're going to do it every day for the next
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.040]   100 days. And it was cool, because I think it created some really good feedback loops,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   at least for me. One was, you ship things. And then people are like, oh, hey, I've been wanting
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.560]   to see this fixed for years. And now it's fixed. It's a relatively simple thing. So you get this
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.880]   sort of nice dopaminergic feedback loop going there. And then people in the team feel the
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.480]   excitement of shipping stuff. I think GitHub was a company that had a little bit of stage
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.120]   fright about shipping previously. And so to break that static friction and ship a little bit more,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.520]   I think felt good. And then the other one is just the learning loop. By trying to do lots
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.000]   of small things, I got exposed to like, OK, this team is really good. Or this part of the code has
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.680]   a lot of tech debt. Or hey, we shipped that, and it was actually kind of bad. How come that design
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.000]   got out? Whereas if the project had been some six-month thing, I'm not sure my learning would
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   have been quite as quick about the company. And there's still things I missed and mistakes I made,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.040]   for sure. But that was part of how I think-- no one knows counterfactually whether that
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.840]   made a big difference or not. But I do think that earned some trust.
