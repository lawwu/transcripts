[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Well, last time we wrestled with the texts that promise that one day we will see God,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.760]   and those texts that say that we cannot see God.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.200]   And today we have a question about when the children of God will see Jesus himself face
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   to face.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.560]   Will that be sooner, or will it be later?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.320]   The question comes in to us from John in Denver, Colorado.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.660]   Pastor John, I see two biblical realities I cannot reconcile in my own mind, and you
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.520]   are the man for the task.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.740]   First, I see a strong emphasis that Jesus is about to return to earth.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.360]   The church stands on her toes in anticipation, it seems.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.160]   Also, I see a millennium, a 1,000 year period on earth before Christ returns.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040]   We are not in the millennium, I don't think.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.740]   So Christ is at least 1,000 years off and soon to return.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.240]   How do I reconcile those two realities?
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.180]   Hmm.
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.420]   There is one place in the Bible where this 1,000 years is spoken of explicitly, and let's
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.260]   read it because my guess is most people don't see it in context very often.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.060]   They just bandy these things about.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.340]   So let me read verses 1 to 6 of Revelation 20 and then try to answer his question.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.300]   Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.380]   pit and a great chain.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.420]   And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and bound him
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.540]   for 1,000 years and threw him into the pit and shut it and sealed it over him so that
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.580]   he might not deceive the nations any longer until the 1,000 years were ended.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.780]   After that, he must be released for a little while.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.180]   Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.260]   Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.300]   the word of God and those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.660]   its mark on their foreheads or their hands.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   They came to life and reign with Christ for 1,000 years.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.380]   The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.900]   This is the first resurrection.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.020]   In my view, a lot hangs on what you make of that statement.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.460]   That resurrection, rising to reign with Christ for 1,000 years, this is the first resurrection.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.340]   Where does that happen will make all the difference.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.300]   Number six, "Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.900]   Over such, the second death," that's hell, "has no power, but they will be priests of
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.140]   God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for 1,000 years."
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.300]   So there's the one place in the Bible where explicitly it says there'll be 1,000 years,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.580]   sometimes called millennial, meaning 1,000 millennial reign of Christ on the earth.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.620]   Now the question that divides Bible-believing Christians is how this 1,000-year reign of
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.540]   Christ on the earth, followed by a complete revolution of things in the new heavens and
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.940]   the new earth, how that relates to the second coming of Christ.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.300]   Some say the 1,000 years, the millennium, is a reference to the period of time where
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.020]   we are right now as Christ reigns in heaven today, till he puts all of his enemies under
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.020]   his feet.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.220]   And then Christ comes back after this age of mission to the nations is complete, and
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.580]   then there's the new heavens and the new earth, they're established, and that view is called
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.020]   amillennialism.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.060]   Not the best name, I think most of them would agree.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.460]   What it means is that there is no future millennium that we're waiting for because we're in it
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.460]   now.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.380]   So amillennialism, not the very greatest title, because they would say, "No, there is one
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.980]   and we're in it now."
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.220]   And it's symbolic for a very long period of time in which Christ is reigning now.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   Some others say that the 1,000 years is a real period of lengthy glory in this age.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.100]   We're not in it yet.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.480]   It will come just before Christ comes so that the gospel triumphs in the world.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.260]   The world is Christianized, by and large.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.780]   Peace and righteousness hold sway in the world.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.740]   And then after that, post that, this is postmillennial, Christ returns.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:15.180]   So that's called postmillennialism because the second coming happens after a real future,
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.380]   long time of triumph for the gospel in the earth.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.580]   And then here's the third view, and I put myself here.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:34.940]   Some say that the 1,000 years happens after Christ comes again, or he comes pre- before
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.340]   the millennium, and that's why it's called premillennialism.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.020]   And then after Christ comes to a very rebellious earth and establishes his reign, there is
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.420]   a long, long period of glorious rule of Christ on the earth.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.940]   Now, John's question makes it sound to me like he's not aware of this view.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.540]   I mean, he says, "We are not in the millennium."
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.820]   Okay, I agree with that.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.140]   I don't think so, he says.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.700]   So Christ is at least 1,000 years off.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.180]   I don't know where he gets that necessity.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.800]   And soon to return, he says, "How can it be soon to return if there's 1,000 years between
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.180]   us and Christ?"
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:30.620]   So my answer is that Christ may not be at all 1,000 years off because a millennium does
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.660]   not have to come first.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.660]   That's my view.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.800]   It comes after Christ's return.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.100]   So Christ could come very, very quickly.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.700]   I pray he does.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:49.740]   I have really good friends who hold all three of these positions, and so I'm not going to
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.260]   withhold my fellowship or friendship over these kinds of disagreements.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.180]   But I would simply suggest to John that he study that section and get some books and
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.740]   read about these views, that he study that section in Revelation, and that he read especially
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:16.940]   verses 4 to 6 of Revelation 20 very carefully and ask what the first resurrection looks
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.700]   like it refers to.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.780]   That's when the millennium begins.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.000]   They came to life, reigned with Christ for 1,000 years.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.980]   This is the first resurrection, and then the millennium starts.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.020]   I think that resurrection is the resurrection at the coming of Christ, the second coming,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.440]   and that's when the millennium begins.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.200]   So John can press on with his joyful sense of expectation in the Lord's return.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.060]   It could happen very, very soon.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   He doesn't have to wait 1,000 years.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.060]   Thank you for the question, John.

[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.960]   Well speaking of timing and when we can expect things to happen, does God know the day and
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.320]   the hour when we will each die?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   Is our time set?
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.500]   Has he set that time?
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.720]   And is God in control of the day and hour?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.800]   That's the question coming up on Friday as Pastor John scours the Bible to find all of
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   the evidence that he can find to make his answer from Scripture.
