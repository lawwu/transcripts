[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.240]   Gus, welcome to our show.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.280]   >> Thank you, Rick, glad to be with you.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.560]   >> Gus, you're a favorite among the Bogleheads, and
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.400]   you've got a really interesting background about how you got started in investing.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.040]   Could you share with us some of your earlier ventures into the markets,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.240]   as far back as you can remember?
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.760]   >> Yeah, I guess I was always intrigued with how money could make money for you.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.800]   I guess I used to travel to the bank with my parents, and watch them make deposits,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.320]   and try to figure out what was going on in the banking system.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.560]   This is back before I was ten years old, and I was really intrigued with the notion.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.440]   So I actually started my own little bank,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.400]   which probably violated hundreds of laws.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.240]   But I basically collected deposits, and then invested that in the bank, and
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.880]   earned a little bit of return, and then returned that to the investors.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.200]   But it was really kind of my first foray into kind of the world of investing,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.720]   if you will.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.400]   And I was about, I'm gonna say I was about ten years old when I did that.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.480]   That really piqued my interest, and when I was 12 years old,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360]   I had had a paper route for a couple of years.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.380]   And I made a fair amount of money for a little kid back in the 60s,
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.680]   and had some money to invest in my first stock was in a local
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   firm called Rupp Industries.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.360]   They made snowmobiles, actually went under after a few years, so
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.560]   I didn't make much money on that.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.320]   My second investment, I am proud to say I'm one of the original owners of
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.620]   the Cleveland Cavaliers.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.360]   So they went public when they first came out, when they were first formed.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.860]   And I invested in that stock, I think it was maybe 1969, so
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.520]   I was about 15 years old at that point in time.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   But all of this really led to my strong interest in investing, and
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.160]   led to my academic career focusing on economics and finance.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.640]   >> So your undergraduate was from Dartmouth College, and then right after
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   that, you went to the University of Chicago for an MBA, or
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.840]   did you do something in between?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> I worked for a couple of years, so
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.200]   really jobs that weren't really getting me towards my ultimate goal.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.160]   I graduated from college in 1976, which was a tough job market.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.040]   And so I kind of took what came along, and
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.920]   knew that I wanted to go back to business school anyway.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   So I worked for two years, and then did go back to the University of Chicago.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.800]   >> Back then, say early 1970s, when you were at the University of Chicago,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.760]   I mean, was the culture there like it is now, where there was a belief in
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.520]   passive investing by one side of the finance department, and then there was also
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.240]   belief in active investing by the other side, is it as pronounced as it is today?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.840]   >> It was not as pronounced back then.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   There was a course in behavioral finance back then, wasn't widely taken,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.960]   but that was kind of the initial seed towards belief in active as well.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   I would say that the belief in passive really dominated back in the 70s,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.680]   at the University of Chicago.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.320]   Today, it is more balanced.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.520]   The UChicago has a very large behavioral finance group now,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.680]   led by Dick Thaler, who just recently won the Nobel Prize.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   And so it's more of a balance than it was back then.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   >> After you graduated from the University of Chicago, what did you do after that?
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.560]   >> My initial job, I ended up as a commercial real estate developer,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   working for a national firm, but relatively small, called LaSalle Partners,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.560]   which is now the LaSalle of Jones Lang LaSalle.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.400]   They merged into Jones Lang.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.920]   It was a great firm with very high quality professionals, and
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.280]   I did enjoy it a lot.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.400]   I was on the analysis side, on the development side, in building buildings,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.520]   and I was doing all the financial analysis behind it.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.920]   This was in the Denver office, I was transferred to the Denver office, and
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   we built several large buildings while I was out there for a couple of years.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.640]   And then through a friend of a friend,
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.240]   I came across an opportunity to pursue gold mining, which reminds me a lot.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.040]   It certainly does to me now.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.880]   So I had this opportunity to put together a deal to create a gold mine.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   So I put a venture capital deal together, started the gold mine.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.800]   It was south of Las Vegas.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   Our options were to either live in Las Vegas or Needles, California.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   My wife agreed to go with me only if we went to Las Vegas.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.160]   So I ended up in Las Vegas for three years.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.320]   It took me three years to drive that company under, and at that point,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   it became clear to me I wanted to pursue a career in investing.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.840]   And I had a good friend at the University of Chicago who had gone immediately
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.600]   to work with Pimco, and he kept after me saying,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.440]   you've got to get into the investment business.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   He said he would love it.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.840]   And so I finally did pursue it in 1985 when the gold mine went under.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.800]   And is that when you interviewed with Vanguard?
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   No.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.440]   Actually, I interviewed with Pimco a couple of times, and I made the weird decision that
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.960]   I wanted to return back to my home state of Ohio.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.520]   The unfortunate thing is there are not many investment management firms in Ohio, but I
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.000]   did move back to Ohio and work for a couple of years in a trust investment department.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.440]   And I was fortunate in that the head of the trust investment department wanted to develop
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   a quantitative investing program.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.080]   And I was the only person in the group that had quantitative investment skills because
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.280]   I had focused on quantitative finance at the University of Chicago.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.160]   And so I basically got the opportunity to build that program.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.840]   And it turned out I ran into Jack Brennan, who subsequently became chairman and CEO of
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.480]   Vanguard many years later, ran into him at our 10th reunion at Dartmouth.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   We were classmates.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.400]   He was asking what I was doing, and I told him about my work in the regional bank.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   And a couple of months later, got a call from Jeremy Duffield, who ended up hiring me into
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   Vanguard.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.520]   And when you went to Vanguard to be hired, did you get a chance to meet with Jack Bogle?
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.120]   I actually interviewed with Jack.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.040]   I went out on a Friday afternoon, we were going to meet Saturday morning, and I was
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.960]   going directly from an event at my wife's employment.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.640]   And so I was wearing tennis shoes or basketball shoes, and I had my good shoes in the back
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   of the car.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.360]   When she drove me to the airport, I left my good shoes in the back of the car.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.920]   I ended up interviewing in basketball shoes, which was a little nerve wracking.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.800]   I still ended up getting the job, but I guess Jack thought it was a little amusing.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.480]   Well, you were going to be doing a lot of running at Vanguard anyway, so I guess it
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   was appropriate.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.560]   Yeah, good point.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.680]   So then you started at Vanguard, and your first job there was to create a quantitative
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.240]   investing program at Vanguard?
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.800]   That's right.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:20.040]   Vanguard had, at that point, one S&P 500 index fund, the 500 index fund, and a couple of
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   separate accounts.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.360]   And most of the money was in the S&P 500, about a billion, 1.2 billion, I think, to
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.480]   be exact.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.440]   Jack wanted to expand the program dramatically.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.940]   His own son had gone into active quantitative investing, which is what I had been doing
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.560]   at the bank, and so he wanted to build both the index side and the active quant side.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.840]   It turns out that active quant and indexing use many of the same techniques.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.560]   I think of indexing as really passive quant versus active quant, and so I was in charge
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.760]   of trying to build out that entire program.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   So Gus, in 1987 when you joined Vanguard, they had one index fund, it had less than
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.840]   a couple of billion dollars in it, and the focus was on building out a quant shop, and
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.560]   this was Jack Bogle's decision.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.980]   So he was, even at that time, looking at straddling both sides of the fence.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.880]   Then indexing really began to expand, and you must have been given more and more direction
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:29.320]   to create all these different new index funds, international fund, even the real estate fund
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   and so forth.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.200]   So as you started out doing quant and you were expanding that, and then how did you
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.920]   pick up the role of expanding indexing as well?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.720]   Yes, so as you noted, we had one index fund, and actually that was the entirety of all
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.640]   of the internally managed equity funds.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.760]   As you know, Vanguard uses external advisors for traditional active equity management,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.000]   and we were trying to build out the internal management, both on the index side, the passive
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.920]   side, and the active quant side.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.560]   Jack wanted to build that out as well, and the common thread is that they both use very
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.160]   similar techniques, active quant versus passive quant.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.560]   So initially, the one index fund, we followed that with a small cap index fund.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:27.480]   That was in 1989, and then just kept expanding the offering over time as we gained critical
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:33.920]   mass within the lineup and felt the need to add to it.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.080]   We did launch new funds as an example, and I think in 1993, we launched Total Stock Market,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.600]   and that really is the fund that people should most be focused on.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.040]   It is the total U.S. market.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:56.880]   I should say that actually, I started October 5th of 1987, and the crash happened two weeks
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.840]   later, October 19th of 1987.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   In the meantime, we were trying to develop the extended market portfolio, and we ultimately
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.480]   launched that December 21st, 1987.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.600]   So I was there for a total of two months.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:17.320]   The equity group consisted of one other person and me, and I was trying to manage what was
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   going on with the crash.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.120]   At the same time, develop the extended market portfolio.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.240]   So there was a lot going on managing money under fire and trying to develop new funds.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   We kept rolling out more and more funds over the years.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.200]   Indexing was not well accepted at the time.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.040]   I remember going to conference after conference, so these would be retail-oriented back in
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.160]   the '90s, trying to talk about indexing, and the typical MO then was I'd be on a panel
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.040]   with one other active manager, and not coincidentally, that active manager would be a very successful
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.320]   active manager, and I would be debating the merits of indexing, and that active manager
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.080]   would be talking about how active management is so easy.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:07.040]   And so it was really a tough slog back in the '90s, so it was kind of built brick
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.200]   by brick, and we kept offering new funds, and our competition was kind of putting down
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.520]   the concept of indexing, but it slowly did take hold, and I think there were several
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:25.000]   reasons that ultimately, indexing has gotten to the point where it is today.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.120]   Just before we get to the growth of the indexing side, how did the quant side do during all
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   of this?
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:36.400]   Were you able to develop programs or strategies that actually worked, or did you find that
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.120]   they worked for a while, and then they didn't work anymore?
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:47.200]   So in 1989, a couple of years after I arrived at Vanguard, we actually did start working
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.080]   on our ActiveQuant program, and quite honestly, that was my true love.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.960]   Most managers want to try to beat the market and prove that they have some skill, and I
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.660]   guess I was no different from most other people in the industry in that regard.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.100]   So it was very intriguing to me to try to put quantitative programs together.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.100]   These would be computer programs that would actually pick stocks and then try to beat
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.240]   various market indexes.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.180]   We launched our first fund, I think, or our first portfolio, I think it was 1991.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:25.780]   It was a portion of Windsor II, and we had some varying success with that.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.060]   By and large, the program was successful.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.580]   We kept adding more and more funds.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.980]   We added a portion of Morgan, a portion of Explorer, and the Strategic Equity Fund.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:42.300]   I think Strategic Equity was 1994, and so we kept growing the quant side alongside of
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.060]   the index group, and we had reasonable success.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.980]   Like any active manager, we'd have periods where we'd do pretty well, and periods where
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.980]   we'd experience a lot of difficulties.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:01.180]   Over a longer time period, we were successful at adding some incremental value above and
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:07.580]   beyond a benchmark return, and that program continues to this day, and it is in the tens
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:15.420]   of billions of dollars, which pales in comparison to indexing, but is fairly large for an active
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.940]   quant shop.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.380]   And so I would say that it was ultimately a successful program, but then again with
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   measured success.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.740]   I mean, just like any active manager, it's a very difficult game to the extent you can
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.200]   outperform market benchmarks, you're doing fairly well.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.820]   So can I drill down into something that you often hear about out in the public, and advisors
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.820]   say this all the time.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.980]   It's like, "Ah, I'm going to go out and index the easy stuff, the big stuff, the stuff that
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.940]   it's hard to find value, so I'm going to use index funds for U.S. large cap."
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:54.860]   But there is opportunity in U.S. small cap, because companies are not followed as closely
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.620]   on and on a lot of different reasons.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:04.340]   In your experience, is that true, that there are more opportunities to outperform for managers
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.420]   in, say, small cap than large cap?
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.500]   Well, it really isn't true.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.300]   I understand that their argument really goes back to the beginning of modern portfolio
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.820]   theory back in the 60s and 70s, and is refuting the efficient market hypothesis that was developed
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:30.900]   by a number of academicians, primarily Gene Fama, who won the Nobel Prize for his work.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.580]   Most active managers say, "Well, the markets are not efficient, and therefore you can add
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.780]   value," and they say, "Well, maybe they're efficient in the large cap segment of the
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.500]   market, but they're not efficient in international markets, particularly emerging markets or
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.180]   small cap segment of the U.S. market."
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.260]   If the markets were perfectly efficient, then clearly the only thing you should do would
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   be to index.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.140]   Personally, I believe markets are not perfectly efficient.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.580]   I think they're reasonably efficient, and they are getting more efficient, but there
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.340]   might be some opportunities to add value.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:09.500]   The interesting thing to me is that my belief and Vanguard's belief, I believe, about indexing
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.540]   is not based on the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:20.460]   It's based on what's become known as Bill Sharpe talked in the early 90s about the math
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:27.740]   behind indexing, and it's a really simple concept that in aggregate, all investors own
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.820]   the market.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.980]   What rate of return can investors possibly get?
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.840]   That's the market rate of return, because collectively they own the market.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.240]   You might guess that some investors could do better than the market, but it would necessarily
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.220]   mean that others would have to underperform the market.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.580]   Unfortunately, investors do have costs of getting the market rate of return, so collectively
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.180]   they don't get the market rate of return.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.060]   They get something less than the market rate of return, and it's significantly less.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.940]   It's about 1% less.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.820]   That's roughly the range of costs, and arguably even greater than that.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.660]   Somebody who outperforms a little bit before costs ends up underperforming after costs,
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.860]   and it means the majority of investors will underperform a market benchmark.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   That argument does not apply to the S&P 500.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.900]   It does not apply to large-cap stocks in the U.S.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.540]   It applies to the market, all of the market.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.220]   Whether you're talking small-cap stocks in the U.S. or emerging markets or other international
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:31.140]   markets, that simple concept, Sharpe's math, still applies.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.500]   In fact, we've seen that the data supports that.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.440]   If you look at the performance of active managers in emerging markets relative to an emerging
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.300]   market benchmark, the majority will underperform.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.660]   The same is true when you look at small-cap segments within the U.S., whether it's small-cap
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:52.060]   value, small-cap blend, or small-cap growth, the small-cap managers have a very difficult
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.980]   time beating the small-cap segment of the market.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:02.180]   While some can, in aggregate, they can't and don't and haven't.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.540]   If active managers, before fees, have some skill and can outperform, for whatever reason,
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.180]   whether quantitative or going out and meeting with companies and picking stocks or whatever
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:21.660]   the reason, they actually do outperform, before fee, on average, but underperform net of fees,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.620]   then why wouldn't we just go out, if we're going to look for active managers, and just
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:31.100]   hire the active managers who have the absolute rock-bottom lowest cost?
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.420]   I think it's a great point.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:39.100]   In fact, that is one that we argued at Vanguard, and Vanguard still supports that today, that
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:45.700]   really, while people think of Vanguard as an index shop, and many people think that's
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.180]   all Vanguard does, we thought of ourselves as low-cost investors, trying to provide low-cost
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:59.740]   investing to all of the investors in our funds, whether it was index funds or active funds.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:06.940]   As mentioned in the Bill Sharp math, the handicap that active management has is cost, and so
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.900]   it's very important to keep those costs as low as possible in order not to handicap your
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.180]   active managers.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.940]   You can take a great active manager and make them a bad active manager by overcharging
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:26.300]   for them, and so you should focus on low-cost funds, and in fact, there have been many,
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:33.340]   many studies, Morningstar has done them, academics have done them, that show that the best predictor
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.780]   of future relative performance is cost.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:43.380]   So in other words, the lowest-cost funds will outperform the highest-cost funds on average,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.220]   and so you should definitely be focusing on that segment of the market as you're going
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.600]   after active management, or index funds as well.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.100]   There are high-cost index funds, which makes absolutely no sense, but I would also point
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:02.100]   out that even though you go to a low-cost manager, they have to have skill in addition
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.740]   to just being low-cost.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:11.860]   Low-cost isn't the only recipe, you need skill as well, because they have to be able to take
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.860]   advantage of other investors, and it turns out that if you're going to outperform, somebody
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.700]   else has to underperform.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.540]   By definition, if in aggregate, everybody gets the market rate of return before cost,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.500]   you're proposing that there's a greater fool out there that you're going to be able to
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.620]   take advantage of, and I think that people used to say, "Well, the retail investors were
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.220]   the greater fool, those who were investing their own money without the use of professionals,"
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.780]   and it turns out that if you go back to the '70s, there were a lot of retail investors.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.540]   A large portion of the U.S. marketplace was dominated by retail investors.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.220]   Today that's not the case.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.060]   Today, it's really dominated by institutional investors.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.380]   It's a very, very difficult game today because it's hard to find the greater fool out there
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.380]   today.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.960]   I'm going to put one more item in there about low-fee active management.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.060]   My studies and my research in looking at that, it seems like some of the active management
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.820]   firms are gaming that because when you look at the performance of very low-fee active
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.940]   managers, and I'm not talking about Vanguard or any particular fund, but in the aggregate,
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.180]   the funds that have low fees, a lot of them tend to be closet index funds.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.080]   They're not really active management.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.900]   They're just looking for investors who are looking for low fees, just buying into the
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:39.460]   argument, the Bill Sharp argument that fees are the main driver of return, and therefore
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.140]   you should be looking for active managers that have low fees, and so people are looking
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.580]   for that and they're hiring managers that have low fees, but they're not really looking
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:53.100]   at the skill side because a lot of these funds are just "closet index funds."
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.740]   Have you found that to be true?
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:03.420]   I think it is true in some cases, and certainly factor funds are that, they're purely that,
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:10.140]   but you're right that you have to have that skill component if you're going to make any
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.980]   sense out of active management.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:18.900]   Low cost is one requirement, but it's not the only requirement to add value and actually
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.240]   beat the marketplace.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.540]   Once people begin to find the good active managers that have skill, that also have low
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.380]   fees, then that's where all the money goes, and this also then changes the dynamics of
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.740]   the fund itself and makes it even more difficult for the active manager to outperform, so doesn't
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.620]   the fund have to close at some point?
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.980]   Yes, there is no question to that.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.260]   The size is very difficult to manage.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.860]   Smaller funds, intermediate-sized funds, tend to outperform the mega funds, so a fund should
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.780]   close if it gets to be, or should be closed if it gets to be too large.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:07.140]   The way we attacked that at Vanguard was to use multiple managers, so if you look at funds
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.980]   like Morgan and Windsor II and Explorer, as those funds got larger, we realized that one
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.500]   manager couldn't handle more and more assets, so we added additional managers in what are
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.380]   called multi-manager funds.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.780]   There are other funds like PrimeCap, where PrimeCap themselves recognize the detriment
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:34.620]   of having too much in the way of assets, and PrimeCap is always very aggressive about saying,
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.740]   "No, we've got to close the fund," and so the PrimeCap fund, capital opportunities, those
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:47.340]   are closed because of the difficulty that size poses on providing extra returns.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:52.020]   I'm going to shift gears here and start talking about exchange-traded funds, which was something
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:24:00.020]   that Jack Bogle was against initially, but Jack Brennan was for, and I believe he tasked
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:06.380]   you with figuring out how to do it, and you came up with, or you helped, and your group
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:16.220]   came up with this patent that allowed your open-end funds to issue ETF share classes
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.180]   and used to call them "vipers."
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.460]   Could you talk about all that evolution and how that came about?
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.060]   Actually, it turns out that at the beginning, Jack Brennan wasn't really behind the concept
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:32.540]   of ETFs either, but you'll recall in 1997, we experienced a correction in the market
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.900]   in the fall time, which became known as the Asian contagion, a lot of difficulty in Southeast
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.180]   Asian communities that created some global turmoil.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:51.260]   Then in 1998, the summer of '98, we had the Russian debt crisis, the Russian bond crisis,
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.820]   and once again, creating turmoil in the marketplace.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.780]   This is all with the backdrop of a very strong bull market in the U.S. that was the tech
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.580]   bubble building, but you had these corrections along the way.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.900]   I guess I was a bit of a product of when I started at Vanguard in 1987 and the crash
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.980]   hitting two weeks later, and I was responsible for the S&P 500 fund and trying to figure
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.020]   out how we were going to handle this.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.740]   I started worrying as our index program was getting much, much larger a decade later by
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:27.420]   '97 and '98, I was thinking, "What if we had another crash and we had people running
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   for the exits?
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:35.060]   How would we be able to fund the redemptions on a much bigger base than we had back in
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   1987?"
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:42.620]   I started thinking about, "Well, if we could provide a vehicle for people who were less
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.220]   long-term oriented than we would like, those that might be inclined to jump ship, then
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   that would be a good way to steer them away from our longer-term investors so that they
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.180]   wouldn't have a negative impact on those long-term investors."
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.340]   At the time, ETFs were starting to get a little bit of momentum.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.100]   They were started in 1993, but started off very, very slowly.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.980]   I started thinking about the concept of creating a share class of our existing funds.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.660]   The problem was, what happens if we have investors in our existing funds who got scared in a
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.660]   market pullback?
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:26.180]   I was talking to Walter Lenhard, who was in our group, we came up with the idea of, "Well,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:33.180]   if we create this other share class and enable investors who might be shorter-term oriented
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.860]   to transfer from the regular share class into that other share class, that they could then
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:44.300]   sell out of that share class in the ETF marketplace at any point in time when they might become
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   nervous."
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:53.340]   Our ETFs were very different from the other ETFs that existed then and exist to this day,
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:27:00.620]   that our ETFs were merely a part of the exact same fund as our traditional index funds.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.460]   They were simply another share class.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.580]   To explain that a little bit more, in our various index funds, we have a lot of different
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.620]   share classes, the investor share class, the admiral share class, the institutional share
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620]   class.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.300]   They're all investing in the same pot of money, but just coming in through a different service
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.500]   door, if you will.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.420]   The ETF portal was just one more entrance into that same fund.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.300]   The portfolio manager is managing one pot of money without really even the knowledge
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.820]   of where the money came from.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:37.380]   The beauty of the ETF structure, the sidecar, if you will, was that if investors wanted
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:45.380]   to get out of their portfolio or their investment in the index fund, they could sell it on the
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:51.140]   exchange through the ETF share class and it had absolutely no impact on the other investors
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.140]   in the fund.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:58.940]   It accomplished what we were hoping to do, and that was enable investors who might not
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.020]   have the long-term orientation that we desire a way to exit the fund without impacting other
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   investors.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:13.780]   You went out and patented this idea, and you got a patent on it, and to this day, no other
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.540]   company can do that, exactly what you described, which is a great idea, a genius idea to do
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.940]   it that way, but other companies now can't do that.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.700]   Because of the patent, they would have to go to Vanguard and pay Vanguard something
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.480]   to use the patent.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   That's correct.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.380]   I think in total, I might have five or six patents on that concept.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:42.480]   They keep expanding them, but there is a statute of limitations that you can keep people away
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.780]   from using your patent, and it's about to run out.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.720]   I think it has maybe a couple of more years left.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.660]   There were some mutual fund firms that approached us asking if they could use the concept, and
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.500]   we were willing to talk with them.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:03.220]   Nothing ever came of it, and I don't know, it will be interesting to see if others adopt
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.540]   this structure once our patent does run out within the next several years.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:14.380]   I find it odd because I personally have approached a couple of big mutual fund companies who
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:19.940]   are competitors of Vanguard, and I said, "Why don't you just pay Vanguard to use their patent
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:26.140]   because if you have only open-end funds, you could really help to eliminate all of these
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:31.860]   capital gain distributions at the end of the year if you did the ETF plus open-end share
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.420]   strategy or concept that Vanguard has created."
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.340]   I don't know what Vanguard would charge, but if they charge a couple of basis points, just
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.580]   pay it because it would help the shareholders in your open-end fund.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.700]   They just didn't have any interest in paying Vanguard at all.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.980]   Well, yes, and maybe that's not terribly surprising, paying a competitor who is having a lot of
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:02.180]   success in the marketplace anyways, you don't want to subsidize Vanguard's success.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:10.140]   I would say that there were several unintended benefits from that ETF structure as well.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:16.540]   I was really looking for a way to insulate the fund from short-term investors' negative
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:23.820]   impacts on a fund, and the side benefit that you just mentioned is that it also enhanced
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.900]   the tax efficiency of the fund.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.860]   We got a lot of benefits from it.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.900]   It also opened up a whole marketplace for us that we really hadn't addressed previously,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.500]   and that was the advisor market.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:44.660]   We were relatively small in the advisor channel, and this really gave us a platform that advisors
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.700]   really wanted to use.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.900]   Actually, Rick, you may remember this.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:57.380]   We had a meeting with advisors in the early 2000s in Chicago, and it was over dinner.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:04.100]   I was sitting with about five or six advisors, and you happened to be one of them.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:09.940]   I asked the question why advisors were interested in active ETFs.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:18.020]   I could understand the index ETFs, because the thought was that investors wanted to have
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.620]   the ability to move in and out of the market rather quickly.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:27.460]   It turns out that the advisor group really didn't want that benefit.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.500]   People said that's what it was all about, but it really wasn't, and every one of you
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.380]   sitting at the table said that the reason you liked ETFs was because of the platform
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380]   it provided.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:43.940]   In other words, a mutual fund platform is difficult for advisors in that you buy a mutual
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.940]   fund.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.180]   You place your order sometime throughout the day.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.020]   You don't know how many shares you're going to be buying.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.520]   You don't know what the price is going to be.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.940]   You just know the dollar amount, and you find out about 5.30 at night how many shares you
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.980]   got at what price.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.740]   On the other hand, the ETF share class fits right into the advisor platform, which is
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.260]   typically a brokerage platform where you place your order at whatever time throughout the
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:12.500]   day, and within minutes or seconds, your order is executed, and you know how many shares
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   you wanted to buy.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.580]   You bought that many shares.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.500]   You know the price you paid instantly.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.780]   All of you said that the platform was what really enticed you to that share class.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:29.180]   That opened up a whole new world for us to serve the advisor community as well.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.100]   >>COREY: Well, there was another complete new market that you were able to service.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.220]   I was an independent advisor.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:42.260]   I wasn't at a brokerage firm, but by creating exchange-traded funds, you opened up Vanguard
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.700]   to the Merrill Lynches of the world and all of the different advisors that were working
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.620]   in the brokerage industry, the wire houses.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:57.460]   All of a sudden, brokers now could start using Vanguard funds, whereas before, their companies
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.300]   would not allow them to buy Vanguard funds because Vanguard didn't pay them a commission
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.900]   and didn't pay 12B1 fees.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:09.060]   Well, now that Vanguard had exchange-traded funds, brokers from Merrill Lynch and Wells
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:15.500]   Fargo and so forth could all begin to use Vanguard funds, so it opened up a huge new
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.620]   distribution channel, and so it was another byproduct to doing that.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.780]   >>STEVE: Yeah, that's kind of a funny story.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.140]   Back in the early days, 2001 or something like that, I actually went around with some
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:34.580]   of our sales people or service people to talk to some of the major wire houses, and one
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.900]   of the very, very largest wire houses, I won't name them, was all excited.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.980]   They said, "You mean we can buy Vanguard funds because our clients have been asking for Vanguard
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.420]   funds and they hadn't provided them?"
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   I said, "Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.300]   You can buy Vanguard funds now in this format, and we'd love for you to do that."
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.900]   They said, "Great, and how are you going to pay us?"
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   I said, "We're not going to pay you.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.860]   You're going to have to figure that out with your clients, but we're not paying you, but
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.620]   you have access to the funds in the format you want them."
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.860]   >>STEVE: So let's continue on then.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.180]   Great stories.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.620]   So you stayed at Vanguard for several more years, and the ETF market just exploded, and
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:18.100]   the index funds continued to explode, and the quant group continued to expand, and eventually,
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.900]   after 25 years, you decided to retire.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:29.500]   >>JEREMY: Yeah, so I had talked with Jack Brennan when he stepped down in 2008.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   He was telling individually all of the members of his senior staff, and I was one of the
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.100]   members of his senior staff, that he was going to step down.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.780]   Jack and I had been friends in college, so I was the last senior staff member that he
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.340]   told, and I was just totally flabbergasted when he told me he was stepping down because
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:53.020]   we were the same age, and we were only 54 at the time, so I thought he had lots and
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.300]   lots of years left.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.260]   One of the many reasons that he wanted to step down was because he felt you should only
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:06.220]   be CEO of a company for 10 years, and that somebody else should take over and enhance
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.340]   what you've been able to do.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.040]   Another reason was he wanted to do other things as well, and so both of those weighed heavily
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:20.220]   on my decision to step down when I was 58 years old, and the third factor that weighed
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.340]   on my decision was my parents as well.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.660]   I wanted to be able to spend some meaningful time with them as they were in their 90s,
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.460]   and I'm glad I did have that opportunity.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.100]   >>COREY: I remember the day talking with you when you announced that you were retiring,
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.540]   and I asked you what you were going to be doing, and of course, I asked you if you would
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.220]   work for me, and you kindly declined.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.900]   I knew that was never going to happen, but I had to ask anyway.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.460]   But now you're back active again.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.220]   You're involved in a lot of committees.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:59.020]   You're working as a professor, if you will, or guest professor at University of Chicago.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.180]   Could you tell us all the different things that you're doing?
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   >>JOHN: Yeah.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:08.700]   So when I announced my retirement, I was contacted by the dean of the business school at Chicago,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:16.100]   and I had remained close to the school after I graduated, and he asked me if I wanted to
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.940]   become an executive in residence at the school after I retired.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   What did that mean to you?
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:28.460]   Because I'm not sure what it means, and he said, "Basically, you can come and do whatever
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.700]   you want and build your own program."
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:37.460]   So because of my parents' situation, I really couldn't pursue it for about a year, year
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:44.220]   and a half after I retired, and then finally, I did show up at the University of Chicago.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.820]   I actually only stayed for one quarter.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.460]   I ended up doing some guest lecturing.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:55.540]   I mentored a lot of students, spent time with the finance faculty.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.180]   My office was right in the middle of the finance faculty.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.380]   It was quite intimidating, in fact.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.460]   Right across the hall from my office was Gene Fama, five doors down was Lars Hansen.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.860]   Both of them had won the Nobel Prize about five months earlier.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.500]   Right next door to me was Dick Thaler.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:18.260]   He won the Nobel Prize a year or so ago, and I knew he was going to win it.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.740]   John Campbell was right next to Gene Fama.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.340]   I believe he will win the Nobel Prize at some point in time.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:31.100]   So here I am among all of these super academics, and that's daunting.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.540]   You have to be a little careful what you say, but I think at the same time, they were interested
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.220]   in my real-world experience.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.700]   So while they had, obviously, lots of time to think about the academic side, they were
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.980]   intrigued with the real-world aspects of finance as well.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:54.060]   So it was a fun experience, but at the same time, I started hearing from firms.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.020]   Some wanted me to consider going on boards.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.940]   I decided I did not want to join a board of directors because there are lots of things
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.280]   that boards are involved with that I really didn't want to pursue.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.780]   My love was investing, and I really wanted to get back into that.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.380]   In my career throughout Vanguard, I actually got pulled further and further away from the
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.500]   day-to-day investing.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.180]   So I wanted to get back to that, and I focused on investment committees, and at this point
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:26.940]   in time, I have a portfolio of six different clients on their investment committees that
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.460]   keeps me more than busy enough.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:35.780]   I'm pretty much flunking retirement, and at the same time, I am on the dean's council
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.900]   at the Chicago Booth, which is the business school at the University of Chicago.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:45.820]   So I spend a fair amount of time at UChicago as well, so I get to scratch that itch as
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   well.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:53.420]   It sounds like you're very busy still, which is great because you've got so much experience.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:39:00.460]   I'd like to turn the questions over to the Bogleheads forum members.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.980]   Before I have a guest on the program, I post on bogleheads.org who I'm going to have about
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:12.520]   a week prior, and the community Boglehead members will come up and ask various questions.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:20.020]   So these questions will be based on what the Bogleheads want to know.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.220]   One person wants to know how you feel about the Fidelity zero-fee index funds.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:31.860]   The number one, are they really no cost, or are they just low-fee or zero-fee, and how
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.300]   that might impact the whole indexing industry, and this is a race to the bottom, and where
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.300]   does it end?
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:44.020]   Well, first of all, I guess if I were in one of their existing funds prior to the initiation
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:51.460]   of these new funds, I'd be a little upset that I'm paying the fee, and I'm not getting
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.940]   to participate in the zero-fee fund.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:59.780]   In fact, I can't take my money out of the existing fund because I'd have to pay capital
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.060]   gains to move it to the zero-fee fund.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.060]   So it seems to me-
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:08.260]   I didn't realize that you can't just move it over, that you would actually have to sell
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.120]   one fund to just buy the exact same fund.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   It's not the same-
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   Exactly.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:20.180]   It's not like Vanguard structure, where the ETF share class is just another share class
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.940]   of an existing fund, where you can move within share classes.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:31.020]   This is a whole new fund that you'd have to move to, and if you move to a new fund, you
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.020]   realize capital gains in your existing investments.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.460]   So you're pretty well locked into your existing investments if you've been in there for any
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.460]   length of time.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:46.580]   So to me, if I had been a loyal long-term investor, I'd be a little bit upset that the
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:51.980]   new investor was getting something that I couldn't get.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:41:00.360]   Now addressing the fee component, I do believe that there are actually zero fees being charged
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   by Fidelity.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.660]   There are some other fees that are paid by the fund.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:12.380]   There may be some direct fees that are relatively minor, but I would also check to see how security
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.780]   lending is being handled.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:21.300]   Since funds have a big inventory of stocks, they can lend out those stocks to people who
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:27.140]   want to go short in the marketplace, and the funds earn a rate of return for doing that.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.860]   At Vanguard, depending on the fund, you might pick up an extra basis point in return, or
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:38.160]   even as many as 10 or 12 basis points in return from securities lending.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.060]   That's just a free return that you're getting because the fund has this ability to lend
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.200]   out the stocks.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:51.460]   I would check in to seeing how Fidelity is handling securities lending.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:57.700]   It's obvious that Fidelity would have costs of managing these assets, and is Fidelity
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:04.980]   just willing to use the funds as lost leaders, or are they making money someplace else?
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.420]   I would check to see if they're making money in securities lending, and I suspect that
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.340]   is where they're making the money.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:17.460]   They would be the agent for the fund lending out the securities and being paid a fee for
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.780]   that.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:25.100]   I suspect, I don't know this for a fact, I haven't checked into it, that Fidelity is
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:31.500]   still making a fee, or making revenue from the fund, it's just not in the expense ratio.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.740]   It's revenue for providing a different service to the fund.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.660]   But to your other point, is this a race to the bottom?
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.700]   Yes, I think Vanguard created the race to the bottom back when Jack Bogle launched the
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:49.380]   first index fund, and Vanguard's had a dramatic effect on the industry, not just the index
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.460]   side of the industry, but the active side as well.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.820]   Fees have come down because of the threat that Vanguard has created in the industry,
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.620]   and now people are trying to, having against Vanguard on the active side, they've got to
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.620]   lower fees, and on the passive side, they're lowering fees, and it is a race to the bottom.
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:11.580]   I guess the advantage I've always felt that Vanguard has is Vanguard is the only fund
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.260]   company that is mutually owned.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.420]   So in other words, the funds own Vanguard, and the investors in those funds own the funds,
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.260]   so indirectly, the investors in the funds own Vanguard.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.660]   That means Vanguard does not have to generate a profit.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:30.740]   There's nobody else that owns Vanguard that's looking for a return on their capital.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   Every other firm has owners that are looking for a return on their investment, and so every
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.220]   other firm in aggregate somehow has to produce a profit.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:47.860]   Vanguard does not produce a profit because of the mutual structure, and therefore can
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:55.020]   offer funds at cost, and to the extent Vanguard has tremendous economies of scale, those costs
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:01.300]   are going to be spread across a very large base, and therefore costs will be very low
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.660]   just naturally.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.740]   There's nothing being subsidized.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.620]   You don't have to have lost leaders in Vanguard.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.060]   It's just a natural consequence of the structure.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:15.980]   >>Corey: A lot of people always ask me, "What is the real true cost of running a mutual
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   fund?
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.340]   What is the real cost to the company to run it?"
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   Well, just look at Vanguard.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.220]   You look at their fees, and they're a mutual benefit company, so the cost of running the
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.220]   funds is the true cost of running a mutual fund.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:36.860]   Other companies, which might be large, actively managed companies, who might be charging 0.6%,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:44.940]   0.7% versus 0.06%, what's the difference between the cost to run the fund and what they're
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.500]   getting?
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.580]   That's called profit, or at least gross profit anyway.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:57.020]   I want to go to a couple more things, and the time we have remaining.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:05.180]   One of them is the idea of smart beta, or is it risk, or is it behavioral-based, and
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:12.980]   are the risk premiums, if it is a risk story, are they being compressed by the amount of
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.540]   "smart beta" or factor investing that's going on?
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:24.460]   >>Mark: Yeah, so there's this large undertow in the mutual fund industry nowadays, and
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.100]   investing in these so-called smart beta products.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:32.220]   They used to be called fundamental indexing, and the marketers just keep making better
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.540]   and better names to make it sell more and more.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:42.100]   Typically what they are, they're investing in a segment of the market, and most of them,
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:48.540]   many of them, are really kind of focusing on the mid-cap value segment of the market.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.420]   We know that historically mid-cap value has outperformed the broader market, so not surprisingly
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:58.500]   when people do back tests and come out with these funds, the back tests look great because
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.900]   they focus on mid-cap value, which is outperformed.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:10.420]   The big question is, to me, is would you expect this outperformance to continue into the future,
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.180]   and if so, why?
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.620]   Is it based on risk?
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.660]   Modern portfolio theory tells us the greater the risk you take, the better the return you
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:24.540]   should get, and that's what a lot of people have said, is that you're taking additional
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.820]   risk and therefore you should get a greater return.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:31.100]   The problem I have with that is there are two types of risk.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.700]   One is called systematic risk, and the other is non-systematic risk, and so systematic
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:41.500]   risk is really the risk of investing in the market itself, and then non-systematic risk
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.580]   would be investing in smaller segments of the market.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:50.660]   It might even be extended to investing in individual stocks, so there's what's called
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:58.180]   an idiosyncratic risk component of an individual stock, and that would be non-systematic risk.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:05.680]   So the market risk of a stock, let's just call it Apple, if the market goes up, Apple
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   will tend to go up.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.300]   If the market goes down, Apple will tend to go down, but Apple will do differently from
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   the market.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.980]   It'll do better or worse based on its own characteristics.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.300]   That's the non-systematic portion of risk.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:24.660]   So my question would be, should you be compensated for non-systematic risk?
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.580]   And portfolio theory tells us that you should not be.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:35.140]   Non-systematic risk can be diversified away, and so if society does not bear a risk, why
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.540]   should society pay you to take that risk?
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.060]   So society doesn't bear non-systematic risk.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.200]   Society only bears systematic risk, in other words, society only bears market risk.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.900]   Why should society pay anyone else to take on certain segments of risk?
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:59.340]   And taking that to, as an example, look at the, let's say there are 10 sectors of the
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:04.140]   market, the financial sector, the energy sector, the healthcare sector, and so on.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.780]   So let's say you divide the market into 10 broad sectors.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:12.860]   Well, invariably, almost every one of the sectors will be riskier than the market as
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.860]   a whole.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:20.940]   And I've actually done this exercise and shown that about seven or eight of the 10 or 11
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.740]   sectors are historically riskier than the market itself.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:32.540]   So if you were to invest in every one of these sectors, instead of the one fund that covers
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.340]   the entire market, would you expect a greater return?
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:40.460]   Because they're riskier than the market, should they provide you a greater return than the
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.460]   market?
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.020]   Well, obviously, if you add them all up together, they are the market, so you can't get more
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.740]   than the market return, even though you're taking greater risk in almost all of these
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:51.780]   underlying funds.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:57.180]   So in other words, you're not being compensated for taking this non-systematic risk.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:03.740]   And that's where I come down on this betting on mid-cap value or other segments that are
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.060]   called smart data.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.320]   Are you being compensated for risk or is it something else?
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:16.460]   And we do know that historically, value has outperformed and smaller cap stocks have outperformed,
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.260]   going back to the mid-1920s.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.820]   And I think there's another reason why they have outperformed.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.380]   It's not a risk explanation.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.360]   To me, it's behavioral finance.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.620]   We talked a little bit about that previously, the debate going on inside of the University
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.620]   of Chicago.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.740]   So behavioral finance says that we all act irrationally in various aspects of our lives,
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.020]   and the reason that there are mispricings in the marketplace to begin with, the reason
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:48.740]   markets are not perfectly efficient, is because we act irrationally when we invest in various
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.420]   ways, and that creates mispricings.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:56.340]   You can imagine with, let's say, something that's a value stock.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.460]   Value stocks tend to be under pressure.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:06.440]   The performance of the company tends to be lagging as opposed to a gross stock.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.900]   And so the stock market performance might be underperforming, and people tend to avoid
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.900]   those.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:17.380]   Well, they avoid them to the point where they become an attractive opportunity.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:23.020]   At the same time, growth is the other side of that, where people love a good growth story,
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.820]   and they maybe overpriced a gross stock.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.380]   So you end up with these mispricings because of behavioral aspects.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.940]   And then that reverses back.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.700]   Ultimately, the fundamentals will end the day, and gross stocks will underperform and
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.780]   value stocks will outperform.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.340]   The problem I have with all of this going forward is, once something like that is known
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.460]   and understood, it gets arbitraged away extremely quickly.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:53.500]   And I believe that that's where we are, that it's being arbitraged away, and the markets
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.400]   are much more efficient today than they have been historically.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:05.660]   So I'm not a big fan of this concept of smart beta, because I think you're basically fighting
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   the last battle.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.100]   You've got to look forward when investing, not backwards.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:18.060]   It's interesting you say that, because I've always wondered, when all of the data originally
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:23.660]   came out on microcap and small cap investing back in the late 1970s, I want to think, in
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:29.500]   early 1980s, and the first small cap funds started coming out, and then going forward
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.540]   after that, after the data came out on the outperformance of small cap, and people now
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.940]   then started taking advantage of it.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:42.540]   So that was the first factor of smart beta use of this data back then, that it hasn't
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.540]   happened since.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.860]   I mean, there hasn't been an outperformance of small cap.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.280]   So has it been arbitraged away?
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:57.660]   Because it is behavioral, like you're saying, or it may or may not be behavioral, but it's
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   certainly a whole lot easier now to invest in those factors than it was 30 years ago
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.140]   or 25 years ago.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.900]   Do you want to buy a fund that has small cap exposure?
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.700]   Just go to one of the many different small cap factor funds.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.420]   You could buy anything you want, even a microcap fund.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:21.220]   If you wanted value, you could go to one of many, many, many different value factor funds
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:28.300]   and buy 100, 200, 500,000 stocks that have value in it.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   So in other words, the ability to invest in these factors, number one, they've become
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:37.060]   known, and when they become known, they become arbitraged.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:43.460]   And the ease and the ability to now do this is all, to me, squeezing out the premiums.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:48.660]   Now, I don't know where it's going to go going forward, but that's my view is, I think I'm
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   agreeing with you.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.660]   It's my view as well, that this is all being arbitraged away.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.840]   Rob Arnott, a gentleman named Rob Arnott, really kind of created this cottage industry
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:05.980]   back in about 2003 or 2004, and I've known Rob for probably 30 years at this point in
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.980]   time.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.960]   And he approached me because he wanted Vanguard to offer the first fundamental index fund.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:17.060]   And so that was the first name of this concept, fundamental indexing.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.240]   And I looked at it, and I ultimately concluded, I said, "Rob, we already offer this fund.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.860]   We have a mid-cap value fund."
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.100]   He contends that it's different from that.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:32.940]   And Rob and I have had a couple of, I won't say heated debates, but kind of fun debates
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.600]   in big venues.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.980]   The Morningstar Advisor Conference, 2,000 people in the audience, Rob and I have debated
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.540]   this concept.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:47.140]   We've actually become kind of friends over the whole thing, but we just agree to disagree
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.140]   on the concept.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:53.580]   But I absolutely believe that once something's known, it can be arbitraged away extremely
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.580]   quickly.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:59.940]   And, you know, you've noted the small cap phenomenon, the same has happened with value
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.940]   as well.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.940]   Interesting.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:06.100]   I've got a couple more minutes, and I want to hit on just two last topics.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.620]   This one is just a quick answer, because the next question I'm going to ask, it might be
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.180]   a little bit longer answer.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.860]   This one happens to do with an individual investor.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:20.860]   Should they buy the global market portfolio, which has almost 50% in international stocks,
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:25.780]   or should they limit their holdings in international to something less?
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:31.500]   Personally, I believe you should have a home country bias.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.000]   Think of if you're an Australian, you'd end up owning 4% of your investments in Australia
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.260]   and, you know, 96% elsewhere.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.980]   That's an extreme.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:45.620]   If you're in the U.S., I still believe you should have a U.S. bias.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:50.500]   You should have an international component, but probably not the full international weight
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   in the global portfolio.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:58.260]   And that's just because there are other risks globally that you don't have at home.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:03.420]   You know, repatriation of funds can be difficult.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:08.380]   Back in 1997, we couldn't get our money out of Malaysia in our emerging markets fund for
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   a year.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:16.340]   And, you know, for those types of reasons, I think you want to overweight your own home
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   country.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:23.420]   Secondly, I would say you're investing in order to pay for your future expenditures,
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.340]   your future liabilities.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.500]   And most of your future expenditures, most of your future liabilities will be domestic.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:33.220]   So you want to make sure that your investments are performing in line with your liabilities
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.220]   or expenditures.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.220]   Okay.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.900]   And here is the last big one, and you may have been anticipating it.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:43.100]   How big can indexing get before it affects the market?
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:50.220]   And in addition to that, Jack Bogle recently came out with some comments about voting index
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:57.060]   funds and how there might be a risk or a danger in just a few companies voting all of the
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:58.660]   index shares.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:06.980]   Yeah, so I've thought about how big indexing could be ever since I started at Vanguard
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:07.980]   back in the 80s.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.180]   You know, I was worried that if it got too big, I didn't have a job.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:18.180]   Actually, I've spoken with Burt Malkiel and Charlie Ellis, two good thinkers about this,
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.380]   two strong advocates for indexing.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:28.840]   And collectively, we have independently come to the agreement that 80 to 85% of the market
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:35.300]   could be indexed without creating any disruptions in the marketplace.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.420]   It's one of those things you kind of know when you get there, but I can tell you we're
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.260]   nowhere near close at this point in time.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:49.980]   My intuition just says the markets will remain efficient even if indexing is 80% of the marketplace.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.480]   So we've got a long way to go there.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.680]   You know, to Jack's point, if indexing becomes concentrated in a handful of firms who end
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:06.180]   up voting most of the proxies, as a manager of investors' assets, you have a fiduciary
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   responsibility.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:16.140]   You have a legal responsibility to manage those assets for the benefit of the investors.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.820]   And I guess I tend to be an optimist.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:27.660]   I'm a glass half full type of person, and I think that the investment firms are doing
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.620]   what's best for their investors and will vote proxies accordingly.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:35.620]   I can certainly tell you I feel that way strongly about what we were doing at Vanguard.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.020]   I used to be very close to the proxy voting process.
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:47.180]   In fact, in the late 80s and early 90s, among other things, I was also voting the proxies.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:55.820]   And so, conceptually, if people got together and colluded and, you know, you could create
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.340]   a problem, I just tend to be an optimist.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:03.220]   And I also know the competition between Vanguard and BlackRock and State Street, the three
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:09.580]   biggest indexers, I can't imagine those three firms would ever collude.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:14.260]   And I can't imagine them really shirking their fiduciary responsibility of doing what's best
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.420]   for the investors in their funds.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.780]   Well, Gus, it's been a real pleasure.
