[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   - Pan today, this is a exclusive event
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.900]   for premium subscribers.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.200]   Thank you so much for everything that you've done
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   for LinkedIn, for joining LinkedIn,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.200]   for being so active on LinkedIn
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.800]   and for asking such great questions.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.240]   One of the things that we have heard
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.760]   from all premium members is they just want more insights,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.600]   more ideas, more understanding of where the world is going,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.720]   how to use LinkedIn better,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.920]   how to be better in their job search,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.320]   how to be better in their overall management
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.680]   of their own professional lives
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.880]   and their own professional voice.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.320]   So we wanted to do something very special today,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   which was to bring the person who knows the most
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.320]   about how to make the most out of LinkedIn,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.880]   which is LinkedIn CEO, Ryan Rosansky,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.820]   who is here to answer all of the great questions
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.660]   that you've submitted.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.160]   We're gonna try to get through as many of these as possible.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400]   Thanks for submitting the phenomenal questions
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400]   that you've already submitted.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.880]   A reminder, to turn on closed captions,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.740]   click on the CC button in the Zoom toolbar
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.400]   and select show captions.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.640]   That's the best way to be able to make sure
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.720]   you see the text here also.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.880]   So with that, I'm gonna bring Ryan in.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.300]   Ryan, welcome to Premium Communities.
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.440]   - Hey, Dan, it's great to be here.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.400]   Hello to all the amazing LinkedIn members.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.960]   It's great to see all the thumbs up
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.240]   and the hearts and the high fives.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.440]   And it's just awesome to have you here today.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.760]   It's great to be here with you.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.440]   Great to be here with you, Dan, as well.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.600]   So where do we wanna start?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.560]   - All right, so let's start, number one,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.800]   with a question that you have spent the last year,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.340]   you've spent your whole career, I think,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.720]   thinking about this, but in the last year with The Path,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.240]   you started really, and The Path is your new video
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.960]   and podcast series where you talk to
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.180]   some of the leaning people in the world
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.440]   about how they've run their own careers,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.800]   how they thought about their own careers,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   what's worked, what hasn't worked, what's been surprises.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.280]   So you think a lot about careers.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.200]   You have seen the careers of hundreds of millions
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.520]   of members flourish on LinkedIn.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   I'm wondering what's your best advice
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.800]   for building a flourishing career?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.160]   We're starting off with the hard one.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.940]   - Yeah, it is hard because every professional in the world
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.920]   asks themselves this question frequently,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.000]   and it determines what you do in your life.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.760]   So it's one of the existential questions in general.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.780]   And I've been very fortunate to be at LinkedIn
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.440]   for nearly 15 years, and we've built
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560]   this amazing community of, now we have
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.640]   north of a billion members on LinkedIn.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.480]   Thanks again to all of you.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.400]   And one of the most requested features that we have
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160]   constantly on LinkedIn are people asking us,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   "Hey, can you build a tool that will show
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   "what career paths look like?"
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.080]   So if I wanna become an accountant,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.200]   like where am I supposed to go to school,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   and what do I do next, what do I do next?
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   If I wanna become a head of product,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.760]   like what is the route to become a head of product?
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.040]   And I remember the first time I heard this,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.160]   I was like, "Oh, what a cool idea.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.680]   "Let's build that thing."
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   And you look at the data inside of LinkedIn,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.700]   which is basically the career paths of a billion people,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.540]   and one thing becomes very clear.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.800]   There literally is no linear career path.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.640]   I mean, for the most part, people are all over the place
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.320]   in terms of how they get to various destinations.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.680]   So I think first and foremost,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280]   one of the most important things that I believe
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.840]   is important for anyone navigating their career
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   is to understand that there is no linear career path.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.460]   There is no preordained way that the world works.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.960]   No one is out there figuring this out for you.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.240]   There's no, you don't get on the train
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.040]   and it takes you where you're going.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.520]   And it's why we created this idea of the path,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.200]   the video series where we talk about people
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.280]   about their career paths.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.560]   And it's why I think the most important thing
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.460]   for any professional to understand
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.800]   is to get inside of their head
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.080]   that there's no ordained path and I'm in control of it.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.800]   When you understand that you're in control
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.080]   of your career path, no one's doing it for you,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   it can then help you really make great decisions
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.480]   and embrace where it is you need to go.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.980]   So then the natural question is,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.120]   how do I decide what to do or how to navigate
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.920]   once I understand that my career is inside of my control?
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.280]   And I've thought a lot about this one as well.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360]   I've had thousands of career conversations
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.940]   both with our employees at LinkedIn
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.440]   as well as with members across the globe.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   And one of the things that at least I found
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.960]   to be really valuable when you're thinking about
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.000]   what to do with your career is to at least try
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.160]   and understand what really matters to you.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.040]   And I always ask people who come into my office,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.720]   which is where I am right now,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.760]   who say, "Ryan, I need some career advice."
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.280]   I say, "Well, what matters to you?"
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.560]   And a lot of times people don't know what matters to them.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.760]   A lot of times people have a ton of ideas
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.200]   of what matters to them.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.920]   I wanna have impact, I wanna learn, I wanna get promoted,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.940]   I wanna make more money and all these things are great.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.780]   But I really try and get people to narrow it down
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.560]   to just two things.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.520]   Like pick the two most important things
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.400]   that matter to you in your career.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   And it's not set in stone, these things can change over time
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.840]   but you have to have some idea of what matters to you.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   So frequently I'll have people come in
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.560]   and they'll start with 10 things
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.760]   and the next meeting they'll come back
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.320]   and they've narrowed it down to two things.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.760]   And maybe those two things are something like,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.360]   I wanna have impact in the world in my career
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.800]   and I wanna be constantly learning.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.580]   Okay, are you sure those are your two things that matter?
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.960]   And when I can get someone down to those two things,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.200]   I simply ask them to plot it on a two by two graph.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.480]   On one axis is one of them,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.920]   the other axis is the other one.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.080]   And then constantly ask yourself,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.720]   in the job I'm in or the job I'm considering to go into
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.200]   or where I'm thinking about doing in my career,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.840]   am I in the top right quadrant of that graph?
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.920]   'Cause I know what I care about
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.840]   and I know whether or not this opportunity
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.160]   is in the top right quadrant.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.400]   And if you're not, you know how to fix it.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.240]   If you're in a position
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.040]   where you feel like you're not learning,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.600]   either figure out a way to start learning
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.520]   or find a new job where you can start learning in that job.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   And what I've found is that when people are able
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   to narrow it down to the things they care most about,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.700]   maniacally focus on that,
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.760]   they tend to have the most success in their careers.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.740]   They're not chasing a title.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.580]   They're not putting their career in someone else's hands.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.720]   They know what they care about.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.880]   They're passionate what they care about.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.340]   They go after it and great things happen.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.280]   And it's not the only way to do it,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.440]   but it's at least through all the data that we've seen,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.360]   all the conversations we've seen,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.600]   one of the best ways to at least start
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.000]   to approach where you wanna go with your career.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.280]   - And one of the things I love about that also
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.700]   is you can use that for how you do your job.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.120]   First of all, if you're thinking about leaving a company
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.480]   or you're looking for jobs,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.140]   you can use those two areas as a way to narrow down
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.700]   the companies you wanna approach.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.840]   And when you're going through the process,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.680]   those are the questions
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   that you should be asking of companies.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.160]   They get to ask you a lot of questions,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.460]   but you can ask them too.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.300]   These are the two things.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.000]   You can steer your questions in those two areas.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   And by the way, I mean, here's the most important thing too.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.960]   There is no like objective right answer
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.000]   to what are the two things that matter most to you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.240]   All that matters is that you inside of your heart
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.340]   know these are the things that matter to you.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.880]   Like that's what truly matters.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.520]   So the more you can find that, the better.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.840]   - Yeah, by the way, if anyone finds this difficult advice,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.000]   I can tell you that I have heard Ryan give this before.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.920]   I have sat in his office
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.640]   and tried to come up with a two by two
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.280]   and I have not been able to get it down
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.680]   from like five different things.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.360]   So I'm still failing at this exercise,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.320]   but one of these days I'm gonna get it to two.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   - Dan, sorry Dan, welcome to like, you know,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.200]   real time TV here.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.480]   What matters to you in your career?
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   Just out of curiosity.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.320]   - Oh my God.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   Number one is being able to ask you the next question.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.080]   That's the most important thing in my career.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.280]   To me, it is constant learning
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.720]   and I think having a, I don't know, this is a problem.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.000]   I would say like having a large impact
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.800]   and then, but also like having time,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.200]   making sure that I have time with my family.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.120]   So this is like the problem.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.600]   I'm still at a three.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.800]   I still have to narrow one down.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.240]   - You know, one thing, I'm on the learning side,
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.760]   you know, sorry, this is not about Dan,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.840]   but Dan came from a, you know,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.320]   traditional publishing career
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.720]   onto becoming the editor in chief of a,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.200]   you know, professional network.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   You're learning a lot every day.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.200]   And the fact that we have a billion members on LinkedIn
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.680]   gives you that, you know, kind of reach and impact.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.840]   So I think that you're definitely hitting on
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.680]   two for two at least.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.880]   - Yeah, this is why I'm not leaving.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.600]   This is, I'm in the right part of the grid right now.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.400]   All right, Ryan, one of the topics
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.360]   that everyone's talking about right now is AI.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.840]   And we've got a bunch of questions
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.800]   from premium subscribers about this area.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.360]   So shout out to Shruti, Christina, Irina.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.200]   Here's the question.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.240]   How is AI gonna reshape career paths?
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.120]   Have you thought about that?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.000]   - Yeah, first of all, great question.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.360]   You know, thank you for all of you on that question.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   It's definitely the topic of the day, rightfully so.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.160]   I've been fortunate to be working in technology
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.600]   for a couple of decades now.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.520]   And every once in a while,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.960]   you see a paradigm shift that occurs.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   And sometimes these paradigm shifts look like hype.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   Sometimes they are.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.280]   I think it's first and foremost important
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.400]   for everyone to understand that this is not a hype cycle.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.560]   I think that this is a real thing.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.800]   The technology exists.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.160]   We've seen the technology be used inside of our products
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.880]   to great acclaim.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.840]   So there's something really valuable here that's happening.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.880]   The world is shifting.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.160]   So like anything, first and foremost,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   to get in that mindset that like, okay,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.680]   this is a real thing and the world is shifting.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.920]   Like, you know, I'm not gonna like ignore it.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.560]   Is an important first step for everyone
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.520]   just to understand and be cognizant
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.800]   of the fact the world is shifting.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.040]   What I see really smart companies,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.200]   really smart professionals doing right now
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.040]   is fundamentally understanding that roles
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.640]   at the end of the day, Dan, your job or my job
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.360]   or anyone else's job in the world
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160]   is fundamentally not just a title,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.040]   but it's a set of tasks that need to be done
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.160]   and a set of skills that need to be learned
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.640]   in order to do those tasks.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.560]   Like you break it down to the most simplest form
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.000]   and everyone's job is that set of things.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.880]   So you start by putting like your job
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.320]   or a job you're thinking about into that frame.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.960]   Then it's important to understand
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   that certain tasks can be automated through AI.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.280]   And whether they can be automated now
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.040]   or over the next couple of years,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.720]   it's a reality that tasks are gonna be able to be automated.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.400]   So first and foremost,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   if your job is just a set of tasks that can be automated,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.600]   it's important for you to start thinking about
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.880]   probably a new job or what a new career path
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.720]   can look like.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.080]   The majority of people in the world
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   are going to be in a job where certain part of those tasks
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   can be done better in an automated way through AI.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.600]   And that's a great thing.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   And in that case, what's really important
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.560]   is to get yourself in the mindset of
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.240]   how do I start to learn about these tools and features?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.640]   How do I become a better marketer,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.560]   a better customer service agent,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.280]   whatever it is by adapting some of these tools.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.520]   At the end of the day, the tools are also just software.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.720]   So it's similar to saying something like,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.040]   hey, I've learned 10 years ago how to use Excel
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.240]   or how to use PowerPoint in order to do my job better.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.880]   Similar, some of these AI tools
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.280]   should be thought about in the same way.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.960]   How do I adapt those into the way that I can do my job
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.600]   to make me more productive and more successful?
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.080]   So I think that's the right framing
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.240]   that we have on it right now.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.840]   I will say that in any type of,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.800]   let's call it industrial revolution
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.280]   that's ever happened in the world
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.520]   where labor markets start to shift,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.600]   there are periods of disruption.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.120]   There are periods where the way that it used to work
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.160]   isn't the same way it's gonna work moving forward.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.240]   There are definitely areas where people
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   and their current jobs are gonna get disrupted.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.880]   Now, historically, after time,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.400]   those all come back into a great area of prosperity,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.960]   but the most important thing that anyone can do right now
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.600]   is to protect themselves against that
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.840]   by embracing that AI is a real thing,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.360]   understanding how their job breaks down into tasks,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.720]   understanding which tasks can be automated or not,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.880]   and embracing the tools
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.960]   that can help them do their jobs better.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.360]   And the quicker that we can get the labor market
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.800]   into thinking that way,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.840]   the better chance we have of coming out of this quicker
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.640]   and regaining that kind of area
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.240]   of real prosperity in the world.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.520]   So that's kind of the framing that we have on it right now.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.960]   It's also things are changing quickly,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.400]   and we'll always,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.600]   one of my most important things
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.560]   that I wanna make sure we're doing
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.800]   across the LinkedIn platform
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.680]   is that we're sharing the data that we find across the graph.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.040]   Like where are we seeing new roles being created
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   that are AI related?
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.400]   For example, I think over the past year alone,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.680]   we've seen just a massive increase
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.480]   in the number of job listings on LinkedIn
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.400]   that have requirements of like,
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.520]   do you know how to use chat GPT,
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.440]   or do you know how to use any kind of gen AI products?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.160]   So that's starting to happen already.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   We wanna do whatever we can
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.880]   to get this data out to the entire world and say,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.320]   hey, here's what's important
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.280]   for you to be learning right now.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.000]   And that's kind of the path it will be on
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.640]   over the next couple of years, obviously.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.440]   - Yeah, and actually, we have, speaking of data,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   we have data that's gonna come out in January
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.560]   on jobs on the rise.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.400]   We do this every year.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.960]   We look at what are the skills
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.000]   that are leading to the jobs that are most in demand,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.680]   what are the jobs of the future or the near future.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.640]   We'll make sure that this group,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.240]   everyone attending today gets that report
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.760]   when it comes out in January.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.000]   There was also a recent report done
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.720]   by the economic graph and research team at LinkedIn
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.040]   about AI skills and which ones might be,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.760]   which are the skills in any particular profession
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.360]   that AI is probably most likely to automate away,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.000]   which ones are the uniquely human ones
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   that you can lean in on.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.720]   And it kind of breaks it down by the number of professions.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.000]   So we'll try to get that to everyone watching this also.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.200]   - That's great.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.440]   - Speaking of skills, a lot of questions about skills.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.680]   You are extremely passionate about the importance of skills.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.880]   I love the way that you break it down
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.200]   of like any job that you do can be seen
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   as a collection of skills that you put into your role.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.080]   Do you think about, or do you have a sense
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.880]   of what skills are the most essential
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.120]   for today's job market?
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.840]   - Yeah, I mean, a couple of things.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.120]   So first and foremost,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:44.600]   we run a massive global talent marketplace
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.280]   where we're constantly trying to connect
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.200]   someone looking for a job
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.800]   with someone looking to hire someone to do a job.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.920]   And we do it at massive scale.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.680]   Over 10 people get a job on LinkedIn
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.520]   or start a new job on LinkedIn every minute.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.320]   And it's, we're just, we're kind of,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.160]   it's a huge matching problem at the end of the day.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.720]   And all we're trying to do is to help people
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.640]   become more successful by connecting.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.960]   Historically, the way that most people have assessed talent,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.040]   by the way, I've done it.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.600]   I think a lot of people have done it.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.320]   It's the way the world has worked,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.960]   is you look at a couple of things,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.320]   like where did someone go to school
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   or where was their last company?
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.320]   And you'd use that data to assess whether or not
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.120]   they were good or they'd be good at your company.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.800]   Yeah, mostly because there was no better way.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.480]   It was easy to kind of ascertain that.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.960]   So, oh, she went to an Ivy League school,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.440]   so she must be good.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.840]   Or he used to work at Google,
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.480]   so he's probably really good.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.480]   And the problem is when you just look
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.280]   at where someone went to school
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.480]   or where they used to work as a signal
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.040]   to try and find new talent,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.760]   it really minimizes the talent pool in the world.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.920]   And everyone's kind of looking at the same talent pool,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.160]   which means that there's a ton of people
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.320]   around that talent pool that are not being looked at.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.040]   And it creates an extremely inefficient
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.400]   and inequitable labor market.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.320]   So I've been trying to, over the past couple of years,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.040]   say, hey, really understand the actual skills
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.800]   that are needed to do the job.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.040]   Maybe someone needs to be great at SEO
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.920]   or SEM or some, in deep skill like that.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.880]   And they're really talented.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.040]   It doesn't matter where they went to school
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.880]   or where they used to work.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   They're really good at that thing.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.840]   And when you start to look at just by skills,
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.520]   your talent market really opens up.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.160]   You find people you never thought
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.960]   you would have found before.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.400]   Everyone else isn't going after them
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.920]   because not everyone went to Harvard or something.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.040]   And it creates a much more efficient
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   and equitable labor market.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.560]   And so that pivot on skills,
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.760]   I think has been really important for me.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.880]   When I take a look back and look at how the labor market
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.600]   happens across LinkedIn to really open it up
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.360]   and make it more equitable and efficient.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.320]   So that's kind of the pivot that's been really important.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.960]   And I think a lot of companies are starting to do that.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.560]   That's why it's really important.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.120]   If you have a LinkedIn profile,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   make sure your skills are up to date.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.480]   The things that you know how to do
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.960]   are listed as skills on your profile
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.440]   because more and more recruiters
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.480]   are starting their search on LinkedIn
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.720]   by looking at the skills on someone's profile
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.960]   as opposed to the other stuff.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.800]   So I think that's a really important just,
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.000]   you know, change in general.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.960]   Now it happens to help with the AI transformation
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.080]   we just talked a lot about
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.520]   because that's going to have to be
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.440]   how people are assessing talent moving forward
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.760]   based on what they know how to do
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   and the tasks and the skills associated with the role.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.640]   So I think that looking forward,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.720]   I'll at least maybe go,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.120]   so some of what I think are the less obvious
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.720]   and really important skills
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.440]   that the world's going to need moving forward.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.040]   So we talked about the fact
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   that there's going to be a labor market transition with AI.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.080]   So I think that adaptability is an important skill
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.000]   that not a lot of people are talking about right now.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.480]   Resiliencies are really important skill
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.120]   that people are going to have to figure out.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.040]   Your job is going to change.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.840]   Your company is going to change.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.080]   The way that jobs get done is going to change.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   Like, can you adapt to it?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.480]   Can you be resilient around it?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.480]   I think are two things to just really focus on right now
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.200]   in terms of strong talent.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   I think creativity is one of those skills
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.000]   that we're going to find is really, really hard over time
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.120]   for AI to be good at.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   I don't mean creativity like drawing a picture
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   because we've seen AI is actually pretty good at that.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.760]   But when AI has to make a decision about, you know,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.920]   where exactly should we go next?
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.160]   Like what product doesn't exist in the world
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.480]   that we should develop?
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.240]   Like really thinking out of the box,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.080]   creativity is a skill that I would really urge
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.840]   a lot of folks to develop as well.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.000]   Obviously familiarity with the AI tools
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.280]   is going to be important for our last conversation
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.640]   that we talked about.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.240]   And then the last one's a little bit,
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.280]   I don't know if it's controversial,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.760]   but you know, I often talk to people,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   I talk to my kids about the importance
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.800]   of learning how to code.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.280]   Now you could say, hey Ryan,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.400]   like AI is going to be able to do a lot of coding
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.440]   moving forward.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.160]   But I think the importance of learning how to code
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.120]   is really more about learning how to think
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.400]   than it is actually knowing how to code.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.680]   So I put a lot of emphasis into kind of the learning
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.280]   how to think components of learning to code
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.600]   as being a really important thing.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   But I don't know, is there anything else
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.520]   you're seeing across LinkedIn data, Dan,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.080]   that's valuable in calling out?
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.600]   - You know, we see one of the things
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   that we see companies increasingly hire for
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.160]   when they look at skills is growth mindset.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.840]   That's a new one that's starting to show up.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.200]   This idea that you see every kind of problem
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.920]   as something that every situation
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.320]   is something that you can learn from.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.120]   That's really important, especially in an AI world,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.360]   these companies are going through tons of change.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.080]   And you mentioned all the AI ones,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.480]   but you know, it's funny 'cause it doesn't,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.840]   it really is dependent on what you wanna do.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.680]   You go back to Ryan's two by two grid or two by two graph,
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.040]   like think about where you wanna be,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.280]   then think about the skills that you have
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.120]   to get in those areas.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.280]   Like thinking about just what the skills are in general
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.520]   is probably less important than understanding the skills
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.560]   that you need to get in order to be
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.240]   in that top right quadrant of where you wanna be.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.080]   - You know, the other, it's funny,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.240]   the other thing I'll say is that, you know,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.080]   to the extent that there are any, you know,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.160]   managers or leaders that are on the call today,
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.480]   more and more, especially, you know,
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.320]   I know that we're years out of the pandemic still,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.120]   but in a hybrid world or remote world,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.880]   I think there's two things that are really important
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.320]   for any kind of leader or manager right now
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.720]   is the ability to create energy
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.160]   and the ability to create clarity.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.080]   I think like without a doubt,
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.120]   if you're a leader or a manager or anything right now,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.400]   when you go into any kind of situation or a meeting,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.600]   if you're not creating clarity amongst the group of people,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.560]   and maybe it's a typically these days a meeting
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.520]   that's, you know, either some are remote,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.880]   some are in the room, you know, hybrid, et cetera,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.720]   like people aren't necessarily altogether
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.880]   in one place communicating and talking.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.240]   If you're not leaving that meeting creating clarity,
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.960]   then you're not doing your job.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.480]   And secondly, like the world is a really tough place.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.720]   Like, you know, let's just be transparent about it.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.320]   And it's really important to help create energy
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.040]   amongst the people that you work with as well,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.800]   helping them understand the sense of purpose
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.480]   on what they're doing, why they're doing it, et cetera.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.080]   So those are also two things that are maybe more specific
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.040]   to leaders and managers,
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.400]   but some things that I've been noticing
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   are important to navigate this world as well.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.240]   - I love that.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.400]   You know, the CEO of Novartis calls himself
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.520]   the chief energy officer.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.320]   This is his idea that that is the thing he has to bring
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.440]   into every single room that he's in.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.840]   I never heard that term before.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.760]   It's a great point.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.080]   All right, let's talk about premium for a minute.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.560]   Reema and others have asked a similar question,
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.640]   which is, are there premium features
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.120]   that you are most excited about?
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.600]   What's to come in 2024?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.240]   What should they be getting excited about?
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.840]   - Yeah, so good question, Reema.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.120]   So I don't know.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.440]   I was thinking I was like, you know, breaking news,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.080]   but I guess I can say whatever I want on this one.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   But there's a really cool feature that some of you may have,
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.320]   and if not, you're gonna start to get it.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.640]   Everyone should have it, you know, within the next month.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.240]   And it's this concept that we're building in early stages
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.280]   that we're internally calling LinkedIn Coach.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.400]   So basically leveraging AI
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.840]   to help every premium professional on LinkedIn
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   have access to the things that a career coach would give you.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.920]   So for example, if you don't have it now,
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.760]   you'll have it soon.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.520]   You're looking at a job listing,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.480]   and you'll have these, you know,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.920]   kind of AI features that pop up that say,
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.400]   help me understand whether or not this job is good for me.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.640]   The AI looks at the job, it looks at the company.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.080]   It looks at you and your LinkedIn profile
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.640]   and what you know how to do,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.920]   and gives you some real-time tailored advice
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.000]   about what it thinks about you working at that company.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.200]   Assume you wanna pursue a job at that company.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.360]   You can click the button to say,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.720]   how can I best position myself for this job?
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.480]   AI can help knowing what you know how to do well,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.520]   understands the job and the company,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.960]   and help you understand how you should position yourself
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.680]   and talk about the right skills for the job that you have.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.560]   Just like you could have,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.160]   you had a human being career coach,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.320]   like sitting right next to you to help you do that.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.480]   Similarly, when you're looking at,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.520]   you know, something in the feed,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.400]   LinkedIn's feed obviously, you know,
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.680]   is full of sometimes some really, you know,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.000]   valuable, deep, professional knowledge posts.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.200]   Sometimes they're kind of dense,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.480]   but they're really important for your career.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.560]   AI can help you summarize those posts
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.640]   and understand that inside of that post specifically,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.480]   what's valuable for you as an individual.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.600]   So, hey, Ryan is the CEO of LinkedIn.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.840]   Like, here's some things you should take away
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.600]   from this post that are valuable for you to know.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.800]   Just like if I was able to ask, like, you know,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.200]   some professor, like, what is important for me
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   to understand what's going on in the world?
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.600]   So this idea of career coach across LinkedIn
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.160]   for premium members is in its very early stages,
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.920]   but I'm super bullish on the value that it's gonna provide
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.560]   for everyone across the platform.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   So, you know, I think we've talked about it
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.440]   a little bit externally.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.280]   I think it's rolling out, you know, slowly,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.320]   but again, within a month, everyone should have it.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   And I would think of it in two phases.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.360]   Number one, like, play around with it.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.320]   This is like, you know, this is really some,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.120]   you know, it's like bleeding edge stuff
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.800]   that we're developing.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   And we're very fortunate to be part of, you know,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.200]   Microsoft, so we have access
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.360]   to really great technology to do this.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.280]   It's early on, play around with it.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.400]   Let us know what you think, but then, you know,
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.240]   understand this is like early V1 of what this aims to be.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.800]   And, you know, our vision is to create economic opportunity
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.080]   for every member of the global workforce.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.280]   The more that we can give everyone access
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.960]   to a career coach like this,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.400]   I know that we'll be able to help really execute
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.240]   on that vision.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.840]   So, you know, it's gonna be rolling out
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.800]   over the next couple of months.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.640]   It's really exciting.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.880]   I can't wait for you all to see it and play with it,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.320]   but that's kind of a lot of the direction
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.600]   where some of the great premium features would go.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.000]   By the way, that's like one side of it.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.160]   If you're, you know, there's tangible things right now.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.480]   If you're a premium business subscriber,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.640]   the team launched this, you know,
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.040]   fairly seem like innocuous, you know,
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.520]   kind of feature called custom CTA.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.120]   So you can go to edit your profile and add a custom,
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.840]   like call to action under your profile.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.400]   It travels around with you,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.360]   no matter where you are on the site, you know,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.800]   come visit my website if you're trying
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.400]   to sell something, et cetera.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.840]   And that is showing amazing gains right now.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.720]   And people actually creating business,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.600]   selling products and services, et cetera.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.120]   So I don't know, I'm very proud of a lot of the features
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.920]   that are coming out right now around premium.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.280]   And I do feel like we're just getting started,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.120]   especially on the AI stuff.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.160]   - Yeah, I gotta say the coach, the job coach,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.120]   which everyone should have access to by March,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.200]   is really incredibly useful.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.840]   I had one, there was, not that I'm applying,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.680]   but I like to look.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.960]   - Please don't, Dan, please don't use it to find a new job.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.200]   - I'm in the quadrant, I'm in the, I'm not moving.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.880]   But I was looking at one and it said,
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.040]   here is, it was this cool sports job that was,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.240]   it would involve the Olympics.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.440]   And it was pretty clear that I was not,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.360]   I was like almost qualified.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.400]   It was like, we can't see
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.000]   that you have any sports information.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.800]   You should start talking about that on LinkedIn.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.880]   It was like, it was exactly the right coaching.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.640]   So it's very cool and it's only gonna get better.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   So I'm glad you called that one out.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.760]   All right, we have time for one last question.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.920]   We don't have time for any more questions.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.240]   We have time for one more, we have time for one more, sorry.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.400]   This question comes from Natalie Ryan.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.240]   What's the best advice someone has ever given to you?
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.000]   - Oh, thanks, Natalie.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.960]   Yeah, maybe some of the best advice
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   that anyone's ever given to me
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.840]   is to not just listen to only one person's advice.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.880]   And I think that's what's great about LinkedIn
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.320]   is that we've created this community where you can,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.600]   you know, hey, here's Ryan's perspective
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.680]   on what it means to navigate your career path.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.440]   But like, that's not the only perspective.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.160]   And it's also why I created the Path Series
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.400]   to bring on these amazing, you know,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.880]   entrepreneurs and leaders to hear all of their career advice
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.480]   and what they think so that you can take all of it in,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.240]   but then ultimately decide what it is
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   that you wanna go and do with your life.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.520]   I think a lot of it comes back to just owning the fact
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.240]   that you personally control your career
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.120]   and being open to a lot of different people's advice,
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.560]   but not, you know, maniacally following every single,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.440]   whatever the person says is the key to a lot of it.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.840]   So how about you, Dan?
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   What's your best career advice?
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   - I don't know, man.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   I feel the same way.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.160]   I collect so much of it that I'm not sure
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.000]   that I can narrow it down.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.600]   But I heard one that is constant,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.040]   sort of like always rings in the back of my head.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.440]   This came from Brene Brown,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.760]   which was that she said, "Nothing wasted."
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.640]   And I was asking her about her best career advice.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.480]   She's like, "Nothing wasted."
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.920]   And I'm like, does that mean like, don't waste any time?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.960]   She's like, "No, nothing that you do is wasted.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.040]   Everything, every misfortune, every good thing,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.720]   like all of that builds you into who you are."
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.440]   - That mentality, so good.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.360]   - I thought it was really good.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   So I love that nothing wasted idea.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.480]   - I love it.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.800]   - Ryan, this was terrific.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.640]   Thank you so much for doing this.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.240]   I can tell by the emojis flying through the screen
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.720]   that everyone felt the same way,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.240]   that they got a lot of great insights here,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.760]   a lot of good learnings.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.080]   Please give us your feedback.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.200]   What did you think of the session?
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.920]   What do you want to see more of in Premium?
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.560]   Tell us if you're excited about this
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.840]   as you start testing Coach
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.120]   and testing some of the other features,
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.320]   how it's working for you,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.920]   what you want more of, less of.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.680]   And then let us know how you use this great advice
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.520]   that you heard today.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.360]   So does it get you a job?
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.200]   Does it help you pivot?
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.840]   Does it help you focus your career?
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.680]   Love to hear all that.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.200]   You can post it on LinkedIn using the hashtag,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   let's use the hashtag, Premium, Premium Learnings.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.760]   And I guess that's it.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.600]   Ryan, thank you so much.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.920]   - Yeah, hey, just a huge, huge gratitude
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.520]   from the bottom of my heart for all of our members.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.400]   LinkedIn doesn't exist without all of you.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.320]   This time flew by way too quickly.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.440]   Hopefully we can do this again in the near future,
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.520]   but I am very grateful for all of you.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.000]   I hope you have a great rest of your week.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.840]   So thank you.
