[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Components of the food were taken out
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.960]   through industrial and scientific capabilities,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.480]   basically.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.720]   So you're extracting a piece of the whole food
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.680]   and then taking these individual pieces of whole foods
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.760]   that really weren't meant to exist in isolation together
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.920]   and re-putting them together into what
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.320]   I would call a frankenfood.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.280]   So something that never could exist.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   So it's not like it's cooked, or it's squished, or blended,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720]   and mixed with other whole foods to make something new.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.800]   Basically, when you get to ultra-processed foods,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.240]   it's when you've taken out individual constituent
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.800]   components of a whole food and then repackaged them together.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.600]   So what you're going to see on labels--
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.040]   and fundamentally, this has come down to we all
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.280]   need to read all the labels on the food we're eating.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.640]   Because if we think about the food as the bricks
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.840]   to re-3D print our bodies and also the instruction
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.320]   manuals for ourselves, we realize
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.400]   why we have to read labels.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.960]   Because we want to know what impact we're going
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200]   to have on our body of tomorrow.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.680]   And that's why we read labels.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.420]   'cause it's like, this is who we're gonna be tomorrow.
