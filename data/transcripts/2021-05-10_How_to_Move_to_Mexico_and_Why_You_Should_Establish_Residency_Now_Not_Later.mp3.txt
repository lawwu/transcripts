[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   your host, and today I'm here with Enrique Ramirez Corona. Did I get it right?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   That is correct, Joshua. Thank you very much.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Welcome, welcome. So we're here today to talk about immigration to Mexico. On Radical Personal
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Finance, I talk quite a lot about internationalization, about the idea of moving to different places,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   going to different places to build the things that are best for you. And I wanted to invite
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   you on to talk with me about the topic of immigrating into Mexico. I'm U.S. American.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Many of my audience is from the United States of America and also from Canada, and I personally
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   think that Mexico has a very bright future, especially in the coming decades, and I think
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   a lot of people are going to be interested in moving to Mexico. So I'd like to talk with
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   you about the process and just get some clarification on what to do, how to do it, how different
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   people can move to Mexico and what that process is like. So how long have you been practicing
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   immigration law in Mexico?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, I have been practicing immigration law since 2004. I started working for a law firm
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   here in San Miguel de Allende. I live in San Miguel de Allende, and there is where my
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   law firm has its base. The name of my law firm is San Miguel Legal, and so I started
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   to practice in 2004.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Right. And there are lots of expats. San Miguel de Allende is a very popular destination for
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   U.S. Americans, for Canadians, etc.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   That's right. I mean, we have a very big foreign community, most of them American and
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Canadian people, but for many other countries worldwide. So we have a bunch or a lot of
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   people for other countries living and residing in San Miguel de Allende.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Okay. So I have studied the immigration programs that a lot of countries have, and in my opinion,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Mexico has an extremely open and simple immigration program. Mexico is very welcoming to immigrants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Do you think that's right?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I think that is right, and I think that the Mexican government has been improving the
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   law in order to try to make it easier for the foreign people to come to Mexico. They
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   are especially one, obviously, that the people that is thinking to retire in Mexico, that
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   is thinking to invest in Mexico. And from the past years, and I would say probably since
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   2012, Mexican government has been trying to make it easier and faster for people to become
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   either temporary or permanent residents of Mexico.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Okay. So let's pretend that I come to you and I say, "Enrique, I would like to move
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   to Mexico. Tell me about the different ways that I, being a U.S. American, could actually
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   move to Mexico."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Okay. First, as you probably already know, as an American, you have the chance to come
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   to Mexico initially if you want just as a tourist. There is not any, let's say, previous
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   application that you need to do in order to get this tourist visa. You just need, when
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   you cross the border, when you arrive to the airport, you will receive a tourist visa valid
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   for up to 180 days. That's, let's say, the first option. However, if you want to become
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   a temporary or a permanent resident, we have, let's say, several options. To become a
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   temporary resident, you will need to start the process normally, and I will explain what
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I'm saying normally, out of Mexico, before a Mexican consulate, meaning that you will
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   need to request an appointment with the Mexican consulate that is close to the place where
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   you are living, out of Mexico. In order to become a temporary resident, you will need,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   you have some options. One is to prove that you receive Social Security or pension in
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   a monthly average of $1,500.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So, $1,500 U.S. dollars.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   U.S. dollars.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   If you have fixed income, a monthly pension, or a fixed payment of at least $1,500, the
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Mexican government says that's sufficient.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That would be sufficient, and for that purposes, the Mexican consulate will require you to
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   prove that you are having this income at least for the past six months.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Okay.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So, you will be required to bring your last six bank statements proving or showing that
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   you have this income of $1,000 per Social Security or pension of $1,500.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Now, is earned income sufficient, or does it need to be pension income?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   In this case, it needs to be pension income.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Okay.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Okay? We have another option in that regard, that is, if you have a monthly, an account,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   or an investment account where you are holding an average of around $32,000 per month, then
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   the Mexican government will consider and will give you a temporary residency.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   In this case, you will need to show that you have had this average investment balance of
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   $32,000 for the last 12 months.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So, if I have an investment account or a bank account that for the last 12 months has had
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   more than about $32,000, I can come and say to the Mexican government, "Look, I have enough
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   money to support myself.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I don't necessarily have any pension income, but I have enough money.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I'm not going to be a burden on the Mexican government," and they'll give me a temporary
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   residence visa.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That is correct.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Okay.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And that's $32,000 for one person.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   For one person.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And what if I'm married and a married couple?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   If you are married and the name of your wife appears also in your bank statements, they
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   will consider that also for your wife.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Okay.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And children, does the number go up if I have children?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Not really.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It is not established in the law for that purpose, but what you can do is you can get
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   temporary residency for you, for instance, and probably for your wife if she is part
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   of the bank statements.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And when you come to Mexico and you already get your official temporary residency card,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   you will be able to apply also for your children here in Mexico.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Okay.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   In that case, you can start the process here in Mexico.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Okay.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So my audience, the audience for out-of-personal finance, tends to be fairly wealthy.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So to me, this is the simplest option.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Yes, there are people who are retired who are receiving Social Security income, but
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   most, the vast majority of the members of my audience could simply bring a bank statement
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   to the Mexican consulate and say, "Look, I have $32,000.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I have $50,000.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I have $100,000."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And so it's my understanding that almost anyone, of course, I'm sure that there are
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   some regulations, but just talking about normal people, almost anybody could go to the Mexican
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   government, could bring bank statements or proof of wealth, and if they have at least,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   you're saying $32,000, something $30,000 to $40,000 or more, then they could be granted
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   a residency permit in Mexico.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Is that right?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Well, in this case, you start basically as a temporary residency.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   That would be a temporary residency.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Temporary residency.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And so the process is that somebody needs to go to a Mexican consulate.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The process is normally, well, there are some telephone numbers and also you can try to
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   schedule your appointment with the Mexican consulate.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   At this time that we're speaking, it is a little bit complicated, especially in the
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   United States because most of the Mexican consulates are closed or have very reduced
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   hours.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So it is a little bit complicated.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So you can schedule your appointment by a call or you can also send an email and they
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   will schedule or they will give you an appointment.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Basically, in order to get to be able to apply for your Mexican, for your temporary residency,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   they will request to you your passport.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   They will request to you an additional US ID or Canadian ID.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   They will request that you fulfill a format with your personal information.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Obviously, that you bring the bank statement that correspond either for pension or for
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   this balance that you have in your account.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And you will pay around $39 for each visa.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   With that, you should be able to get your temporary residency visa.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And normally, the process takes something around an hour.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Okay.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So to review, we've talked about the ability for US Americans or Canadians and really,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Mexico has a very open policy for tourists.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The vast majority of my listeners can simply come to Mexico as tourists and spend often
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   up to 180 days in Mexico as tourists.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Correct.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And then, well, of course, you wouldn't want to do it for many years.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Many people will come to Mexico, spend 180 days.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   They'll leave somewhere, go somewhere else, come back and potentially be given another
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   180-day tourist visa.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And some people, especially in the past, have done that for many years as a tourist.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   But if you want to become an official temporary resident of Mexico, and what that would mean
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   is that you can stay here in Mexico for the duration of your temporary residence permit,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   which is usually the first time one year.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That is correct.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Right?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Then you can apply for a temporary residence permit.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   To do that, the simplest way for most of my audience will be to get, I think in English
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   would be called the person of means visa.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Is that right?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Correct.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Which just simply says you go to the consulate in your country and you say, "Look, I have
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   in excess of $32,000."
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   More or less, it would change depending on the exchange rate.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But you go and you say, "Look, I have $40,000 in a bank account or in an investment account."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And they say, "Yes, we'll be happy to have you."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   They'll schedule an appointment with the local embassy through the official Mexican website.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   They'll bring their birth certificates, their bank records, marriage certificates sometimes,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and forms of identification, their passport.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   They'll go pay a $39 fee to the local Mexican consulate, and they'll be given a visa to
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   come to Mexico as a temporary resident.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That is correct.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   What they are going to get is basically a visa stamped in their passport.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   This visa allows you to come to Mexico once within the next 180 days that you got that
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   visa.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Okay.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It is very important that people understand that once that they come into Mexico, this
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   is valid for one entry, as I mentioned, but once that they come into Mexico, they need
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   to complete the process here before the local immigration authority.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And they just have 30 days, starting from the day that they enter to Mexico, to start
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   this process.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   The process is basically to request to the local immigration office to change the visa
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   stamped in your passport for your official temporary residency card.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Okay.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Now, generally speaking, so that process is called the canje, right?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The transfer process.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   That's called canje, correct.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So then the individual could expect to receive a temporary resident card.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.500]   That's good for one year?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.000]   Yeah, the first time is going to be valid for one year.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Okay.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   After that one year, you are going to be able to renew it for three more years.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Okay.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   For a total of four years as a temporary.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Okay.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So, the temporary resident visa simply means that when the visa expires, when the physical
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   date that's printed on the card expires, if you don't renew it, you will lose your ability
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   to live in Mexico.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But, you can live in Mexico with that temporary visa.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Correct.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   All right.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Even if, it's a little bit complex, but even if your card expired, but you are out of the
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   country when it expired, you still have 60 days from the expiration date to come to Mexico
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   legally with the same card and renew the card for the other three years.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   We have some other cases where if you are here in Mexico and the card expired, you still
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   can renew your card.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   But, the problem is that you will need to bring to the immigration office, just in this
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   case, all the documents to prove that you have, that you're receiving pension or social
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   security for the amount that we already mentioned, or that you have this balance in your accounts.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Right.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Which is, which make it a little bit complicated.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Right.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Okay.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   So, a temporary resident visa gives you the right to live in Mexico without having to
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   leave.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Correct.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   So, you can spend all of your time in Mexico.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But, it doesn't give you the right to get a job in Mexico, right?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It doesn't give you the right to get a job in Mexico, but you have the chance to apply
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   for it.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Okay.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Meaning, once that you have your temporary residency visa, you can request authorization
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   to the local immigration office to work in something here in Mexico.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Okay.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So, if you found a job with a local person, if I were in San Miguel de Allende and Enrique
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   says, "Joshua, I really need you to work for me," I could take a petition to the local
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   government and apply for a work permit?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yes.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   In this case, this is another way that you can get your temporary residency.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Let's say that a company in Mexico wants to retain your services.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   So, this company needs to be recorded before the immigration authority, and they are going
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   to be, they are going to make an offer to work for you.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They can submit this offer here before the local immigration authority, and they are
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   going to get the authorization.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   With that authorization, they will send that authorization to you basically by email, and
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   with that document, you can also ask for an appointment with the Mexican consulate and
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   prove that you have been already authorized to work in Mexico.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And as consequence, you can receive a temporary residency with permit to work directly.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Perfect.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Perfect.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   But let's say that you got it because you're balancing your account or because your social
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   security or pension, you can also apply for that permit when you are in Mexico already
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   living.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Okay.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So, the first temporary resident visa is issued for 12 months.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   12 months.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And then you go and you apply for a renewal, and they will probably renew it for three
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   years.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Based on the current criteria that they have, yes, they will renew it for three more years.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Okay.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Then, you have the ability to continue living in Mexico for those three years.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   You've now been in Mexico for four years.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   At this point in time, when that three-year visa is set to expire, you can go to the immigration
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   office and you can ask to be given permanent residency status.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Is that right?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   That's correct.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   By law, once you complete these four years as temporary residency, you will pass automatically
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   to permanent resident.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But yes, you will need to, at the expiration of the four year, you will need to go to the
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   immigration office and request the change from temporary to permanent.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Okay.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So, you don't need to prove anything else other than you have been holding a temporary
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   residency visa for four years.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Once you're issued the permanent resident visa, now you don't have to renew it.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   You are a permanent resident, and you can live in Mexico for as long as you want.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   That's correct.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Another advantage that you will have with the permanent residency visa is that, as you
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   go to the immigration, you will not need to renew anymore.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   However, if you, for instance, change your address that you notified to the immigration
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   office, you will need to inform to them that you changed your address or that you changed
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   probably to your marital status.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Okay.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Those are the kind of things that you will need to notify.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Also, as a permanent resident, you have the authorization to work in Mexico already.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   You don't need to request a permit to the immigration office.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   You just notify that you are doing or working in this or that.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   So, the important thing about Mexico that we haven't said yet is that, under Mexican
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   law, there is not, in order to maintain a residency, there is not a specific physical
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   presence requirement that somebody has to be in Mexico in order to maintain their residency,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   either a temporary residence or a permanent residence.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Is that right?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   That is correct.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The Mexican law does not establish any specific time that you need to spend in Mexico in order
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   to continue having your temporary or permanent residency.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So, you can spend a week, one month, or 12 months in Mexico, and you will have the same
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   rights based on the visa that you have.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Right.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   So, if somebody has the idea that, "I think I might want to move to Mexico full-time,"
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   they can start the process whenever they're ready.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   They can go ahead, they can get their first visa, they can come to Mexico, be issued their
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   temporary residency card.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   They don't have to be in Mexico for the next 12 months.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   They could come for a couple of weeks and then leave.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   They can come back one year later, renew for the three-year period.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Correct.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They don't have to be in Mexico for three years.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   They can go and come however fits them.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And then once they have the permanent residency card, they don't have to stay in Mexico in
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   order to maintain that residency card.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   They can come and go as they like.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And under current law, that permanent residency is good for life, for the life of the person,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   although some states want you to come in every decade or so to take a new picture, right?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   That is correct.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Okay.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So, this is very important.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   This is why, for most U.S. Americans, I recommend Mexico so highly.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I think that virtually every U.S. American who thinks they might want to live outside
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the United States should start by getting a residency permit in Mexico.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   It's a wonderful country.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I find the Mexican culture very personally pleasing.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I really enjoy it.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It's a very warm Latin culture.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   There's a lot of cultural compatibility between Mexicans and U.S. Americans, especially if
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   you have any kind of Latino heritage or have friends who are Latinos.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   There's a lot of compatibility.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's very easy to get to, and Mexico really offers virtually everything.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   In some corner of the country, if you want the big city, you can live in Mexico City
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   and have all of the global city advantages.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   If you want a small town by the beach, that's there.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   If you want a resort town, it's really wonderful.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   But the opportunity for someone to have this as a place that they can go to live, that
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   they can retire, and not to have to maintain those physical presence requirements is really
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   powerful, and especially once someone gets to that permanent residence.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   This is why it's so attractive.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   For example, Canada, if you become a permanent resident in Canada, you have to physically
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   be present in Canada for two years out of every five in order to maintain your residency
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   visa.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   For somebody who lives full-time in Canada, that's wonderful.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   For somebody who goes to Canada regularly and wants to maintain their residency, that
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   can be difficult if they're maintaining a job somewhere else.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But the Mexican system is much more generous, and I think it's a wonderful system.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   - Yes, I think that, well, since Mexican law does not require to be present in Mexico to
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   continue having or enjoying your temporary or permanent residency, it allows you or allows
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   the people that they can start this process early, and then they can determine if they
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   really want to move to Mexico or not, or how many time they want to spend in each country.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   My only comment in that regard is as far as I understand for Canadian people is that
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   normally my clients that are Canadian, they don't want to become permanent because I
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   understand that if they become permanent, they will lose the health benefits that the
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Canadian government grant to them.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So in that case, when they complete or they get or arrive to the fourth year, what they
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   do is they're released about the temporary residency, and they need to start the process
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   again for year number one.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Yeah, with immigration planning, you always need to think about the country that you're
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   going to and the country that you're coming from.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   - Correct.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   - And there is planning with regard to the country you're going to, and there is planning
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   with regard to the country you're going from, and that will be unique for each particular
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   country and each particular person.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Now, is there a way that a U.S. American or a Canadian or a German citizen can become
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   also a citizen of Mexico using this process?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   - For sure.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   When you start your process and you get your temporary residency, as we mentioned, after
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   four years, you are going to become permanent resident.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   At that moment and after two years as permanent resident, you have the chance to apply to
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   become Mexican.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   In that case, the only, let's say, in this case, the law already established in that
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   regard that if you want to become Mexican, you cannot be out of Mexico for more than
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   six months in the last two years before you applied for the Mexican citizenship.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Meaning, if today you become permanent, 2021, on May 23, you are going to be eligible to
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   become Mexican.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   But in these two years, you should not be out of Mexico more than six months.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   - Right.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   - So, you don't have to have physical presence in Mexico to maintain your permanent residence
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   permit.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   But when and if you go to apply for Mexican citizenship, then during the two years before
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   that application, you must have been physically present in Mexico for more than six months
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   each year for those two years.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Well, you cannot be out of Mexico more than six months in both years.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Meaning, you need to stay in Mexico at least 18 months in those two years.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   So, actually, not absolutely.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Clarify what you said again.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   You need to not have...
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   What's the distinction between what you're saying and what I'm saying?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   - Yeah, I think the distinction is that in the previous two years before you applied
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   to become Mexican, you cannot stay out of Mexico more than six months.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   - I see.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Six months out of the 24-month period.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   - Correct.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   - I see.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Okay.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So, if on January 1, I enter Mexico, and then we go through the full 12 months, and then
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   the next 12 months to December 31, I need to have been inside Mexico for at least 18
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   out of those 24 months.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   - Correct.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   - Okay.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Then, if that is satisfied, I can go to the Mexican government, and I can apply for Mexican
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   citizenship.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   - That's correct.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   - There will be a language test?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Is there a Spanish language test?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   - It depends on your age.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   But, yes, normally, there is a language test.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   So, they want to verify that you at least can have a conversation in Spanish.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It is not that you are 100% bilingual, but that you can...
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   - So, maybe a B1 level of language, something like that.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   - I would say something like that.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   - Okay.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   - There is going to be a test for history of Mexico, and the rest is going to be paperwork
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   that you will need to...
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   - Okay.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   - That we will need to produce and submit in order to be able to start your process.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   - Is there a criminal background check, an FBI report?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   - Among others, you will need, for instance, obviously, your passport, your birth certificate
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   with an apostille, your permanent residency card.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   We will need to show through a report that the immigration office is going to provide
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   us that you have not been out of Mexico in the past two years for more than six months.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   There is a local criminal record, okay, saying, obviously, that you don't have any criminal
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   records.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   - Local in Mexico?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   So, if I'm living in...
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   - Meaning, local from the state where you are living or you are going to apply for the
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Mexican citizenship.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And then, there is no criminal records for the country.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   These criminal records for the country, you can just get it in Mexico City, okay?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And after that, you fulfill some applications, and that's...you make a payment, and that's
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   pretty much the documents that you will need to require...you will need to meet in order
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   to apply for your Mexican citizenship.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   - Right.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   - And I personally think, it's my opinion, that a Mexican citizenship is an extraordinarily
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   valuable citizenship for somebody to have.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The Mexican passport as a travel document is a very powerful travel document.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   The only country in the world that the Mexican travel document doesn't work for as easily
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   as some other countries is the United States.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   - Right.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   - Which is frustrating for many Mexicans, but that's the only...well, I don't know if
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   it's frustrating.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   That's the only country in the world that looks at a Mexican passport and doesn't give
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   it Tier A access.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   That is an advantage to, for example, Canadians can come to the United States without a visa.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   A German citizen can come to the United States using the electronic travel authorization
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   system, but a Mexican citizen needs to apply for a visa to travel to the United States.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   - Correct.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   - But with the exception of the United States, a Mexican passport is a powerful document
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   can vis-a-vis travel to so many countries of the world, visa-free access to Europe,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and it simply doesn't have a lot of the baggage, a lot of the difficult things that,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   example, a U.S. American passport can bring with it.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   It's a very neutral country.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   I think, in my opinion, Mexico is not generally regarded as...it's a very neutral country.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   It's a very powerful citizenship to have.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   - Yeah, I agree with you in that regard.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I think that Mexican passport is very powerful, and in my experience that I have been working
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   with foreign people for many years, a lot of them wants to become a Mexican citizen
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   because they...obviously, they feel in love with the country, they feel comfortable living
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   here, and they find convenient also for themselves to have a Mexican passport.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And Mexico does not have mandatory military service for your children, like some countries do.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Mexico does impose taxes on Mexican residents living here, but if a Mexican citizen were
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   to move back to Canada or back to the United States, then they can become non-tax resident
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   in Mexico.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   - That is correct.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   - Mexico is not...it's not a particularly overbearing country.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   They don't impose a lot of regulations on their citizens abroad.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It's a really wonderful place, and it's just a wonderful city, wonderful country to live
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   in with many options.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Is there any place...are there any things that people who are working with you for immigration,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   are there any questions that people ask that we haven't covered, or any mistakes that people
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   frequently make?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   - Well, I think that one...I would like to mention another way to get the temporary residency,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   if that works for you.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   If you're ready...sometimes people cannot...either they don't have the income for pension or
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Social Security required, or they don't have this balance in their account, but they already
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   own a property in Mexico.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   So if you already own a property in Mexico, you can also apply and get a temporary residency
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   card.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The only condition in that regard is that your property worth something around $200,000
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   or 3.8 million pesos.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   If you can have copy of your deed or title of your property to the consulate, and you
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   show that your property worth that amount, then they will also grant to you a temporary
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   residency.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   If you are already in Mexico, and let's say that your wife already hold a temporary or
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   permanent residency, you are also...you will be entitled to receive her and start your
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   process directly in Mexico.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   For that purpose, you will need to prove that you are married.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   You will need your marriage certificate with the apostille, but that will allow you to
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   start your process here in Mexico.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Also, same for your children.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   - Right.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   - And if you have a Mexican child, you can stay here as a tourist, and if your child
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   is born in Mexico, then you are allowed to get...you will get in this case, directly
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   in Mexico, the permanent residency.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   So I'm glad you brought that up because that was going to be my next comment.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Mexico is a Jus Sali country, which means that all children who are born in the sovereign
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   territory of Mexico are, by birth, Mexican.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   - Correct.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   - So if my wife were pregnant and we gave birth to a child in Mexican territory, that
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   child would automatically qualify for Mexican citizenship from birth.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   - Yes.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   - Now, in addition, Mexico follows the doctrine of family reunification.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   They want families to be together.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   - That is absolutely correct.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   - So if I have a Mexican child, I can then go to...as the parent of a Mexican child,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I can go to the Mexican government and I can request a permanent resident visa from the
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Mexican government, and in virtually all circumstances, it should be granted to my wife and to me
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and to our siblings and to our other children, right?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   - That is correct.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   - Okay.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Now, is there then a pathway to citizenship if I have that permanent residency visa?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Is it still two years?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   - It is still two years.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   - Okay.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   - Once you get your permanent residency, two years, and you can start the process to become
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Mexican.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   - Right.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   So this is, I think, a powerful option.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   My family and I, we have done birth tourism, and with my experience doing that, I think
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   it's a really tremendous way to open up new opportunities for your children to give them
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   access to the Mexican markets as a citizen, legally able to work, go to school in Mexico.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   For example, I have had Mexican doctors in various parts of the world.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Mexico has a lot of medical schools, and they're paid for by the government.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And so somebody can go to Mexican medical school and become a doctor for just a cost
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   of some books and things like that.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   The tuition is covered.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And that's a powerful option and well-respected in many parts of the world, the Mexican doctors
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   are.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And so it's a powerful option, and it also can be a good benefit for me as the parent
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   of a Mexican child to have the option now to live in Mexico, to have that permanent
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   residency visa, and to go in other places.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And back to kind of those options, there are many people who will go and do birth tourism
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   in countries like Canada or the United States.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And no question, there can be benefits to that, right?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   There are many people who want their children to be Canadian or U.S. American.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   But if you are already Canadian or U.S. American, there's very little benefit to your child
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   being born inside of Canada or the United States, and there could be a lot of benefit
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   for your child being born in Mexico.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And again, with the physical proximity, the fact that a Canadian or U.S. American can
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   drive to Mexico, that makes things a lot easier.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And then even just in terms of the high quality of medical care at a low cost, it's a really
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   great option because, you know, I've known people who have gone to Mexico because they
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   didn't have insurance, health insurance, and they had a C-section.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And if you have a C-section delivery of a child in Mexico, the cost may be something
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   like a few thousand U.S. dollars, 3,000 U.S. dollars, instead of 15,000 or 30,000 U.S.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   dollars like it is sometimes in the United States.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And so it can really be a good option that I think people should consider.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   I've recommended to many people if they're having a baby, you should think about having
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   a baby in Mexico.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   - Yeah, well, I think that we have a great health services here in Mexico.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We cannot complain about the quality of the hospitals and medicals and doctors.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And the amount that you are going to pay compared with the United States or Canada is going
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   to be a big difference.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   So for sure, it's a great advantage for them.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And in addition, as you explained very well, they are going to have the chance to become
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   permanent since their child is going to be born in Mexico.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   - Right, right.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Now, the last thing is, from my observation, Mexico seems to be very open to people who
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   are fleeing persecution, who are seeking asylum.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And in the airport itself, right, as you're coming through immigration, the Mexican Immigration
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Department puts a big sign that says, "If you're in danger in your home country, you
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   should come and ask us for help."
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And the Mexican government promises to hear your case.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   They promise that you can come to them and ask for help regardless of your immigration
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   status, regardless of whether you're here on a visa or if your visa has lapsed.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And they even promise free legal aid for people who are coming and applying for a status.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   So for somebody who is facing some kind of persecution, I think Mexico should also be
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   very seriously considered.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   - Yes, Mexico...
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   As Mexicans, we understand that it's very important to take care of all the people that
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   is coming from other countries since even where the Mexican people normally tries to
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   come to the United States, many times as illegals.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   So we understand very well that part, and that's why the Mexican government create a
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   special authority and a special place where all these people can come and start this process.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It is very interesting.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   The process is not very fast.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It could take between one year and one year and a half.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   But as soon as they submit this or they start this process in Mexico, they are going to
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   be eligible to get a humanitarian visa.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   And with this visa, they will be considered legally...
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   They are going to be legal in Mexico, and they are going to have the chance to even
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   get the authorization to work in Mexico while they start the final ruling from this authority
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   in regard to their immigration situation.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   So I think that this is also a big advantage for people that consider or needs this kind
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   of help.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Absolutely.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And the last question I have is Latin American bureaucracy is legendary.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   One of the challenges of doing business in Latin America is that the law will often say
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   this is what's expected, but the reality is often very different.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   It's the same in the United States of America.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I have friends who have followed every law of immigration law in the United States and
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   have been waiting for five, six years in some cases just for an answer from the government
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   on a very simple scenario.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   So I'm not throwing blame on anybody.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But how would you...
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   When you say these timelines, the biggest question is, are these actually realistic?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   So if you say, yes, you can come and do this, are these timelines realistic that you can
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   actually get answers quickly from the U.S. government?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   You can get business done...
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Sorry, from the Mexican government, or you can get business done quickly, or do we have
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   to deal with delays of weeks and weeks and months and months and months to get an answer
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   from the immigration department?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Nope.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I mean, as I mentioned before to you, the immigration authority, the federal government
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   has tried to make it as simple as possible for all foreign people.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   What they are trying to do is that people come and invest in Mexico, that you come and
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   live in Mexico, because obviously that way you are going to spend also money in Mexico.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Absolutely.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   So it's important for Mexican government.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   I can tell you that I cannot speak for all the immigration offices in Mexico, but at
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   least the ones that we work here in the state of Guanajuato, Querétaro, for instance, that
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   are the closer ones to us.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   If we start your process for the canje that you mentioned to change your visa and your
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   passport for your official card, I can tell you that it's going to take a couple of days
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   to get it.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Remarkable.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So obviously, provided that we submit all the necessary paperwork and documents.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   So a couple of days and you are going to have your card.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Same when you need to renew it.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Obviously, if your card expired and we need to bring additional documents, it's going
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   to take a little bit more.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   But in general terms, I will say that you can consider between three and five business
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   days to get your card and have everything ready.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Okay.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   So I would just give, you don't have to listen to my kind of closing charge, but I would
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   say this.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I honestly believe that for virtually, especially any US American and probably Canadian, Mexico
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   should be very high on your list.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   If not, the number one option should be very high on your list in terms of places to go
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   to have a second residency to start that process going.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Mexico often does not get the press that some other residency programs get.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   For example, Panama gets far more press for their program, their friendly nations visa
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   program.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   But when I compare the two, Mexico is far better than Panama and Mexico has far more
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   options.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I like Panama City, but basically if you want to live in Panama, you have the choice of
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   either Panama City or what's the town?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   There's a retiree town that's a little bit higher, Boquete, Panama, or you have these
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   little beach towns, right?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   It doesn't have the size or the diversity that a place like Mexico has.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Mexico has almost everything to offer.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It's a huge country with 31 states, I think, here in Mexico.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   That's correct.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   31 states here in Mexico with tremendous diversity, biodiversity, economic diversity.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   It's an economic powerhouse.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And yet Mexico has this incredibly generous program that costs virtually nothing to get
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   started.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   A $39 visa plus some attorney fees, which we'll talk about in a moment if you work with
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   an attorney.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   You don't have to work with an attorney.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   You can do it yourself.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   But it's a much lower cost program.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Like Panama, if we compare it, for example, to the Panama Friendly Nations Visa, Panama
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   requires you to work with an attorney there.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   You have to go to Panama.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   You have to start a Panamanian company that you may or may not use.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   You have to put money in the bank that you may or may not want in a Panamanian bank.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Mexico doesn't have any of these requirements.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   And the Panamanian attorney fees, especially for English-speaking attorneys, are often
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   extremely high.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And that's money that you don't get back.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Panama, it's hard to drive to.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   You can drive there from the United States barely, but you've got to go through six borders
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   on the way, whereas Mexico is one border.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And so I just don't understand, having spent a lot of time thinking and researching and
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   working through these options, I understand why U.S. Americans go to Canada.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   I've had Canadian immigration consultants on the show, and I think there's a lot of
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   benefits there to go in the direction of Canadian immigration.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But Canada has some unique benefits and some unique drawbacks.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   And Mexico has a lot more benefits and far fewer drawbacks.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Mexico is not a tax haven.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   You're not going to go to Mexico and save tons of money on your income taxes like you
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   could potentially do in Panama.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   So that's something you do want to take into account.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But depending on your earnings and depending on how your affairs are structured, with good
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   tax planning, Mexico has just a lot to offer.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Am I wrong?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   No, you are completely correct.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   I think that Mexico, as I mentioned several times now, is doing all that we can in order
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   to try to welcome any foreign people that is coming to Mexico and that want to live
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   or invest in Mexico.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   The Mexican government tries to give all kinds of facilities so you can spend time in Mexico,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   so you invest in Mexico, so you live in Mexico.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   So as you mentioned, you can drive from the United States to Mexico pretty easy.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   In that regard, and that's important that you know, as a temporary, you have the chance
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   to drive completely legal and keep for all the time that you are a temporary residency
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   your car with U.S. plates in Mexico.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Once that you become permanent resident, you are not allowed to drive a car with U.S.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   plates in Mexico.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You will need to either return your car or sell it.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   So that's, let's say, one advantage also that you can bring your car without any problem
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   and it's going to be legal as far as you are legal in the country.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Additionally, also you have this chance to bring your personal belongings if you want.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   You are going to be free of any taxes if you can prove that this is yours, your personal,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   this is my personal belongings that I used to have in my house in the United States or
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   in Canada, I want to bring to Mexico or to ship to Mexico and all those personal belongings
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   will come into Mexico free of any taxes.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Right, right.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I think it's a wonderful program and my encouragement is don't wait.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   In the world of immigration law, things change.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I honestly, personally, I think that the Mexican lack of physical presence requirements is
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   probably too generous.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   I think they'll probably change that law myself just because I think that as more and more
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   people, especially many US Americans, are looking to have other options, I think in
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   time the Mexican government may face pressure to change that.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I hope they don't but if you're interested in other residency programs, you should not
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   wait because laws change all the time.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Correct.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But in terms of the future of a country, I personally believe that one of the metrics
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   that you can use to judge the future of a country is based upon how easy is that country
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   to get into, whether that's to come in as a tourist or whether it's to come in as a
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   resident and to immigrate.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   I think that you can tell a lot about a country by the way that they treat people that want
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   to come in their borders.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Countries that have stringent border guards where they say, ask lots of questions, are
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   very invasive, I think it reflects the culture and the culture being an anti-immigrant culture
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   is a culture that doesn't understand that the value of a country is based upon its people.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   The thing that makes a country work is its people and a country that's welcoming to people
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   is a country that I think you can see other signs of growth and opportunity.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   So I personally, that's one of the metrics that I use to judge Mexico and say, I think
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   that Mexico has a very bright future because you can see very clearly with simply a huge
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   sign in the airport by the Mexican immigration authorities saying, it doesn't matter your
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   legal status, you can always seek asylum in Mexico.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   That says a lot about the culture of a country.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Now there can be problems with assimilation and so cultures always have to deal with,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   okay we're welcoming these immigrants but are they able to assimilate into the country.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   But Mexico is such a big country that I think that they can handle many more immigrants
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   than much smaller countries can.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And so I think that Mexico is going to have a wonderful next couple of decades, is my opinion.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   - Thank you very much.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   We appreciate that words and I'm pretty sure as you mentioned, we receive everything,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   everyone in Mexico, we try to be very polite with everyone in Mexico.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   And I think that's one of the reasons that there are a lot of big foreign communities
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   in Mexico just like in San Miguel de Allende, Ajijic, Querétaro or many other places in Mexico.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   You can, Mexico is really big and we have a lot of different states, different areas
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   that you can choose whatever you want from living in a small city such as San Miguel
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   but with a big infrastructure or living in a big city like Querétaro that was one of the,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   that was the state that grow more in the last year or 2019 in North America Latin
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   or you can live in the beach or you can enjoy, you know, any, a lot of places in Mexico.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   You'll always be welcome in Mexico.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Okay, Enrique, your website is sanmiguel-legal.com.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   So sanmiguel-legal.com, I'll make sure to leave that information.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   You will work with people and help facilitate all of the immigration options for them.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   It's not required that somebody who wants to immigrate to Mexico work with a lawyer.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   You can do it yourself.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   What I would say is having done immigration processes myself,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I have promised myself that I won't do it anymore from now on.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   I will simply hire lawyers to do the immigration process myself.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   I've tried to save money and I've tried to do it all myself
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and it's just simply not worth it in my opinion.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So about how much does your law firm charge to work with people on these types of immigration processes that we've talked about?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   - Okay, it will depend of the application that we are doing, but it normally goes from,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   I'm going to speak in U.S. dollars, it goes from $500 to $750 U.S. dollars.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   - Right, per person.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   - Per person.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   - Per person.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   - We guide you through the whole process, meaning even if you are just thinking that you want to come to Mexico
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   and you want to apply for this temporary or permanent residency,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   we will guide you through all the process.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   We can be in contact either by email, by submitting, so whatever you feel more comfortable.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   We are going to make sure that you understand the process.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   When you come to Mexico, we will have pretty much everything ready just to collect your signatures
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   and be able to submit your application to the local immigration office as soon as possible
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   and to complete your process within the next couple of days so you can just enjoy Mexico.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So your email address, and again I'll link it in the show notes, but it's Enrique,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   E-N-R-I-Q-U-E, Enrique@SanMiguel-Legal.com.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   - That is correct.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   - People can email you directly and probably somewhere in the range of $500 to $750 per person for your fees.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   The Mexican government simply has a $39 visa fee, and there may be other modest charges here and there, but it's not a lot.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   - Yeah, when you request the canje that we mentioned, meaning the change from your visa for your official card,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   there is an additional payment that you need to make to the local immigration office.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   - And about how much that is?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   - For a temporary residency is around at this moment $220, and for permanent residency it is around $350.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   - Okay.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   So something around $1,000, more or less, about $1,000 per person, somebody could establish temporary residence in Mexico.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   - Yes.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   - Fair enough.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   - Yeah, but you were, as I mentioned, we're going to guide you through the whole process from the beginning
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   through the moment that you have your card in your hands.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   - And it can be as simple as somebody just simply comes to San Miguel de Allende,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   they come for a week, week and a half, two weeks, you can handle the process, they can enjoy a vacation,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   go with you and your staff to the government offices, and then they have their documents, everything's in order.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   - Yeah, we will take care of everything.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   You will just need to come once to my office to sign the applications and documents,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   and then once to the immigration office, but we will take care of the rest.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   - Awesome.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I promise that's the best $1,000 you're going to spend versus doing it yourself.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   Even as a fluent Spanish speaker myself, I don't have any problem doing it, but navigating,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   okay, I go here, then I go this, and okay, what's the tramite here, and where do I go,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   it can be difficult and a lawyer smooths everything.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Enrique, thank you so much.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   - Thank you very much.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   You're a self-pleasure.
