[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - There were a lot of questions about your daily routine.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   People love this, the morning routine, the daily routine.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   And while I have to believe that everybody's necessary
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.280]   routine is quite different from the next,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.080]   if you wouldn't mind just giving us a sense of like the
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.380]   first couple hours of your day,
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.360]   what that typically looks like when you're like not
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.880]   traveling and you're settled into a place.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.320]   - It's different depending on the place that I'm in,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.040]   but typically it involves waking up,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.760]   going out into the sun as naked as possible
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.800]   to start the day.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600]   I try to take slowly,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000]   wake up slowly.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.360]   And probably within an hour of that,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.000]   I'll leave the house and go for as long of a beach walk as
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.120]   possible. Or if I'm in a place where there's a gym several
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.440]   days a week, I'll go to the gym instead.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.300]   But some, I'll do some activity.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.360]   I would say about an hour after waking up.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   Sometimes it's an hour and a half.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.240]   Sometimes it's less depending on the place I'm at.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.880]   I also might do stretching before I go on the walk and do
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   just several stretches on yoga mats on the floor
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.320]   or with foam rollers or balls or some different things.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   I don't start my day until those things are out of the way.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.840]   I try to avoid any work-related anything.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.560]   Now that said, if a thought comes up that I'm excited about,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.060]   I'll note it. I won't avoid thoughts,
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.060]   but I tend not to engage in any work until probably 11
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.400]   o'clock, 11 a.m. would be the soonest.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200]   And in some days, not until one o'clock.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   And then I do focused work until maybe six,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.040]   and then I spend the rest of the night
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.200]   trying to wind down out of work mode.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.360]   - So 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. are really the peak,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.000]   quote-unquote work hours. - Yeah, could be 11 too.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.520]   Like today we started here at 11 and that felt like,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.360]   I felt like I'd be good by 11.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.640]   And I already did my morning walk.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.560]   I had the argument on the beach.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   I was in the sun. I was in the hot tub.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.300]   I had a whole morning already.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.120]   - And then what does your evening wind down look like
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.640]   in terms of the space that you're in
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.880]   or trying to create and your internal landscape?
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.100]   - Well, it's only red light.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.900]   I'm usually wearing, from the time the sun sets,
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.640]   I'm wearing red glasses.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.580]   I'm in a space with only red light.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.740]   I'm 99% of the time home with my family and we talk.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:11.060]   I might watch a wrestling or a documentary
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.400]   with red glasses on.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.980]   We eat dinner together or we eat dinner in shifts,
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.860]   depending on how it's working, but we're all together.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.980]   And I find something to occupy my mind
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.060]   that gets me out of the workday.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.540]   That said, sometimes the ideas still flow
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.980]   and I'll note them.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.980]   But I avoid any kind of a work phone call
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.840]   or anything that's stimulating
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.300]   or that will get me thinking about it.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.020]   I aim for sunset.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.920]   And then I'm usually in bed.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.020]   I'm usually in bed by 10
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.680]   and fall asleep within 15 minutes.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980]   - Your relationship to light is fascinating.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.180]   The sunlight piece makes a lot of sense
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.620]   and will make sense to the listeners of this podcast.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.540]   We haven't done too many episodes,
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.300]   but we will do more that covers
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.820]   the trying to avoid bright light exposure in the evening.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.680]   You're wearing the red lens glasses now,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.660]   even though it's the middle of the day,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.080]   that's because we've got these bright lights
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.260]   around us, correct?
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.440]   And have you found that limiting
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.500]   your bright artificial light exposure in the evening
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.140]   has benefited you and in what ways?
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.980]   - Absolutely.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.320]   And once you've done it,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.560]   once you've changed and avoid like looking at screens
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.920]   or my phone turns red at night,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.040]   when I see someone else's phone,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.560]   if someone comes to visit
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.040]   and their phone lights up at night,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   it's blinding and it's so disturbing.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   And for them, that's normal.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   They're in this heightened, blown out place all the time.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.580]   I'm staying at neutral.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.860]   I'm staying at the more natural,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.980]   how the world would be if man didn't create
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.060]   all of these loud things,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.380]   loud devices.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.820]   - Yeah, I've switched my phone thanks to your input.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.700]   And we will have released a clip on this
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.760]   by the time this episode airs on the triple click approach
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.560]   to the phone that you can put in very easily,
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.860]   to allow it to go from regular screen to red screen
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.340]   at night so that you don't have to go into the settings
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.940]   each time you just triple click.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.660]   We'll provide a link to that explanation.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.020]   And Rick taught me that when I was over in Italy,
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.140]   everyone in his home turned to me and said,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.380]   "Wait, your phone is so bright.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.460]   "You got to do the red light thing."
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.540]   I said, "I don't know how."
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.140]   And he taught me that.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.180]   So it's a very useful trick.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.220]   - Have you noticed a difference since looking at?
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.140]   - Huge positive difference.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.760]   I sleep better.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.720]   There are great data now.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   'Cause of course I go then find the data that,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.960]   for shift workers, people that have to be up at night
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.040]   working, if they put them under red light,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.320]   the amount of cortisol at that time is suppressed,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.480]   which is great as compared to when they're under bright
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   artificial lights without red lens glasses,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.640]   or if they're in red lights, it's far more beneficial,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.460]   less cortisol.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.840]   You want cortisol high early in the day,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   viewing sunlight early in the day,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.680]   increase it by at least 50%.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.700]   And you want it to taper off and on and on.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.980]   I heard something recently,
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.740]   which is going to make a lot of sense.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   One thing that's happened in the last 30 years,
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.880]   which may at least partially explain the obesity crisis,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   is that calories, which are depleted of nutrients,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.600]   micronutrients are very cheap now.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.960]   See, they're very cheap to get calories,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.020]   but they aren't nutritious calories.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.100]   In addition, there's been a change in lighting technology
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.800]   so that blue light photons are very cheap.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.700]   Like when I was a kid, my parents would say,
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.860]   turn off the lights, it's costing us all this money.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.100]   Now it's very cheap to keep the lights on in a home.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.500]   The heat is a different story, but with respect.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   So we have a lot of cheap photons.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.420]   So I think of blue light as cheap photons,
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.460]   not the good for you photons, not nourishing photons.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.300]   - That's correct.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.680]   - And consuming calories too often
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.580]   or at the wrong times of day, we know is bad for you,
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.060]   consuming photons in the wrong form
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.560]   at the wrong time of day, bad for you.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.360]   And I think those two things combined,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.320]   plus all the downstream negative cascades
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.960]   can largely explain the obesity
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.000]   and in some sense, mental health crisis.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.840]   - Interesting.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.260]   - Yeah, so just there, I editorialized again.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.980]   I realized that we're trying to shift the ratio
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.640]   to more Rick, less Andrew, but-
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.480]   - He can't help himself.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.720]   - He can't help himself.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.440]   And Rick indulges me, so.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.880]   Actually, there were a number of questions in here
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.940]   that asked me, how has Rick helped you?
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.080]   And I'm refraining from answering those
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.900]   'cause people want your answers for them.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.540]   But I do all the things that Rick's referring to.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.140]   I'm not wearing red lens glasses now,
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.940]   but I have changed a lot of my health practices
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.660]   and or sought out science to test
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.660]   whether or not some of the things
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.380]   that you've been doing for a while makes sense.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.220]   And indeed, in every case, they've made sense.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.020]   I'm not just saying that because you're here,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.980]   but you and I do a lot of the same things.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.420]   - Yeah, we're interested.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.600]   And if it didn't work,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.940]   we'd probably stop doing it eventually.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.780]   - Right.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.780]   - It's like we're testing, Rick.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.400]   - Right, and I do believe that what starts out as crazy,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.320]   like Mike Mencer's stuff of low volume weight training
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   with heavy weights,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.040]   it works so much better than the high volumes.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.960]   All that stuff is being shown to be true
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.440]   in these peer reviewed trials.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.960]   So, you know, that's the nature of science.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.760]   It often comes, science often follows the practitioners
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.000]   by many decades.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.120]   You know, it doesn't get there first
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.000]   because it's a slower, more iterative process.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.220]   But some people need to see those clinical trials
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.780]   to feel comfortable doing something.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.980]   I think the creative process is uniquely separated
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.820]   from academic science and academic scholarship
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.660]   in a way that I think has really benefited it.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.420]   I mean, can you imagine if the ghetto boys
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.660]   had to get a degree in music theory
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.940]   in order to do what they do?
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.020]   - They wouldn't be the ghetto boys.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.420]   - Right, or Slayer.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.380]   - They would not be Slayer.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.060]   - Yeah, or Public Enemy.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.900]   - Yes.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.720]   - Or Adele.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.560]   - Yes.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.380]   - Or Eminem, right?
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.020]   It's almost by virtue of the fact
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.220]   that there is no degree for that, per se,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.500]   that allowed them to do what they did, right?
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.760]   (upbeat music)
