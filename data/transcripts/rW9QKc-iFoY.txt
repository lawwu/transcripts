[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.480]   Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.340]   or how we sense things.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880]   On previous episodes, we talked about sensing light
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.040]   and sound waves for things like vision and hearing.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.120]   Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.440]   or what's called interoception.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.640]   things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.960]   how full our gut might happen to be
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.160]   or how empty our gut might happen to be,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600]   but also our inner landscape with respect to chemistry,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   how acidic or how good or bad we feel on the inside.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.440]   This discussion about sense of self and interoception
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.840]   has many important actionable items
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920]   that relate to bodily health and brain health,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.040]   and believe it or not, our ability to perform well
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.500]   or perform poorly in life.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.760]   Indeed, it has profound influence on our rates of healing.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.640]   So today, we are going to talk about all the aspects
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.280]   of our inner landscape and how our brain and body
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.320]   communicate, and there will be many actionable protocols
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200]   as we go along that discussion.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.760]   Before we begin our discussion about sense of self,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.880]   I want to highlight some very recently published
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.800]   research findings that I believe are immediately actionable
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.960]   and that everybody should be aware of.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840]   These are data that were published by my colleague,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.460]   Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.480]   at Stanford University School of Medicine,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.900]   and the data were published in the journal Cell,
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.640]   which is a very, very high stringency cell press journal,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.680]   so phenomenal data.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   What the study showed was that individuals
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.560]   given a high fiber diet actually experience less diversity
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.840]   of what's called the gut microbiome.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.640]   The number of positive or health-promoting bacteria
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.060]   in the gut was actually reduced by a high fiber diet,
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.360]   whereas individuals that ate just a couple of servings
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.560]   of fermented food each day experienced important
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.240]   and beneficial increases in anti-inflammatory markers,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800]   and that could be traced back to improvements
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.500]   in the gut microbiome diversity,
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.520]   the diversity of bugs, literally little bacteria
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.400]   that live in the gut, which might sound bad,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.240]   but they are actually very health-promoting.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.160]   I'm going to get into all the details of this study
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.520]   later in the episode,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.640]   but I just wanted to emphasize these findings
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   because they are immediately actionable.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.840]   I think for most people, ingesting one or two servings
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.620]   of fermented food each day is reasonable
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.440]   and does not bring with it tremendous costs
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   or tremendous inconvenience,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.300]   and I think many people are ingesting high fiber diets,
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.880]   thinking that that's the best way
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.960]   to improve their gut microbiome.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.200]   So while these data may prove to be controversial
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.640]   among the folks out there in the nutrition community
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.760]   that really promote high fiber diet,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.800]   I want to just emphasize that these data
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.720]   were looked at in a very unbiased way.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.000]   They were done with large-scale screens
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.120]   of all sorts of inflammatory markers.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.240]   There was no specific hypothesis going in.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.840]   It was purely exploratory,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.280]   but the data are very, very clear.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat fiber.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   It doesn't mean that fiber is bad,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.520]   but it really shows that eating fermented foods,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.200]   just one or two servings a day,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.960]   and maybe even ramping up to three or four servings per day
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   can be very beneficial for many aspects of health.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.200]   Before we go any further,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.840]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.000]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.780]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.760]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.720]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.420]   that are of the absolutely highest quality.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.640]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.480]   from Stanford,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.120]   and everything about their sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.740]   is developed with performance in mind.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.160]   I've spent my career working on the visual system
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.440]   and its various functionings within the brain
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.120]   and within the eye.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.960]   Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses are so phenomenal
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.840]   because they allow the visual system
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.120]   to do what it does best,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.840]   which is to adjust to changes
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   in what we call luminance or brightness.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   With many sunglasses out there
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.180]   and with many eyeglasses as well,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.440]   if the brightness in the room changes
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560]   or you get cloud cover or you walk into a shadow,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.080]   you have to take the glasses on or off,
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.560]   you can't see as well.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.120]   But the folks at Roca really understand
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.280]   how the visual system works,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.680]   and so they've designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.760]   such that you never experienced that shift.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.960]   You can walk into a shadow,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.300]   the amount of sunlight can change,
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.140]   you can go into a dark room, et cetera,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.400]   provided there's enough light to see,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.180]   you're going to see everything crystal clear.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.720]   In addition, you see everything crystal clear
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   because the lens quality is terrific.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.460]   And the sunglasses and eyeglasses are very lightweight,
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.640]   so you don't even notice that they're on your face.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.500]   Also, the sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.700]   are designed for performance.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.420]   You can use them while running or while cycling.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.320]   Even if you sweat, they won't slip off your face,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.840]   and as I mentioned before, they're very lightweight.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.780]   So everything about these glasses is terrific,
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.840]   and they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.740]   They have a lot of different styles to select from,
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   and unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.120]   they won't make you look like a cyborg.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.900]   You could wear them to dinner or to somebody's home,
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.140]   and they look really nice.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.600]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.640]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.040]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.680]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.000]   to help you better meet your health goals.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.560]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.320]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.420]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.800]   can only be assessed, can only be measured
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.440]   from a quality blood test.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.040]   And now with the advent of quality DNA tests,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.120]   you can get further insight into the status
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.400]   of your immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.560]   One of the problems with a lot of blood and DNA tests
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.100]   that are out there, however, is you get the numbers back,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.040]   you get the levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.240]   but you don't get any information about what to do
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.420]   with those numbers or how to actually shift them
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.400]   in the direction that you want to.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.680]   With Inside Tracker,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.440]   they have this very easy to use dashboard,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.980]   and that dashboard makes it very clear
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.600]   not just what your levels of hormones, et cetera, are,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.440]   but what actions to take in terms of nutrition or exercise
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.780]   or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.220]   into the appropriate ranges for you.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.660]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.460]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.360]   And if you do that,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.300]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.700]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.440]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.940]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.460]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.540]   that's backed by 25 peer-reviewed published studies
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.820]   and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.340]   I started meditating when I was in my teens,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.180]   but for many years,
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.740]   I found it hard to maintain a meditation practice.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.860]   I don't think I'm alone with that.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.820]   I think many people start meditating.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.460]   They'll do it for a few weeks or a few months
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.700]   or maybe even a year,
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.780]   and then they'll give up the meditation practice.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.180]   And we know from so many peer-reviewed studies
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.780]   that meditation has a number of very positive effects
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.760]   on our brain health, our ability to focus,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.800]   and our bodily health.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.640]   So it's a great thing.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.800]   We probably should all be doing it,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.680]   but most of us, including myself,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.640]   have found it hard to stick to a meditation practice.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.400]   Then I started using the Headspace app,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.480]   and what I found is I could be very consistent
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.640]   with my meditation practice
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.240]   because they have meditations that are short,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.880]   meditations that are medium length,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.540]   and meditations that are a bit longer,
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.480]   all of which benefit me.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.080]   The meditations that they have also are of different styles.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.360]   You can try different forms of meditation.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.820]   I particularly like having a guide for my meditation.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.220]   It just helps me stay focused, helps me stay on track,
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.880]   and I'm able to derive all those regular benefits
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   of meditation and keep the practice up on a regular basis.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.720]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.580]   and if you do that,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.080]   you'll get a one-month totally free trial.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.700]   And with that, you'll get all of Headspace's meditations,
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.360]   the full library of meditations.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.440]   You just go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.360]   and you get all of their meditations for one free month,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.200]   and you get to try it.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.320]   If you don't like it, you can stop,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.680]   but I think you will enjoy it.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.940]   I certainly enjoy meditation,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.880]   and we know that it's very beneficial for all of us.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.740]   If you're somebody who cares about your immediate
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.120]   and long-term health,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.360]   and if you're somebody who's interested in performance
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.120]   of any kind in work, in relationships, et cetera,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.420]   today's topic, I believe,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.280]   is among the more important ones for you.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.300]   Of all the topics I could cover,
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.380]   this thing that we call sense of self,
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.660]   which is also called interoception,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.240]   has perhaps the most foundational level of importance
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.420]   for all that we feel, all that we do,
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   and all that we are capable of doing.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.080]   In fact, I will go so far as to say that interoception,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.500]   or our ability to sense our inner real estate,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.460]   is right there next to sleep,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.180]   and perhaps one other feature of our health
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.060]   and bodily function that primarily determine
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.340]   how good we feel in the now, in the short term,
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.860]   and in the long term,
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.660]   and sets the stage for everything we are capable of doing,
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.400]   and if we don't take care of this thing
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.420]   that we call interoception,
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.540]   just like if we don't take care of sleep,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.940]   we cannot perform well and we will not remain healthy.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.820]   Interoception and sense of self
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.580]   are essentially the same thing.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.680]   I will use those terms interchangeably,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.740]   at least for sake of today's discussion.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.900]   And I promise that if you can learn a little bit
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.940]   about the mechanisms of self-sensing,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.060]   of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.540]   as we say, your internal environment,
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.020]   you will position yourself to do some very simple things
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   that can lead to outsize positive effects on everything,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.020]   from sleep, to body composition, to mental focus, to mood,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.660]   your ability to regulate stress,
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.120]   and indeed even your ability to heal and recovery
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.500]   from injuries of different kinds,
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.360]   brain injury and bodily injury.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.420]   So sense of self is absolutely crucial.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.020]   It's sometimes called our sixth sense,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.180]   right alongside the other five senses,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.980]   like hearing, vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.300]   But sense of self is different.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.100]   Sense of self is really about what's going on internally
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.400]   within the confines of our skin.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.920]   And it involves two key features
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.780]   that if you can understand those features
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.660]   and you understand what modulates
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.900]   or changes our ability to sense those features,
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.580]   there are a lot of things that you can do
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.860]   in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices,
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.900]   how you relate to your exercise practices,
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.880]   perhaps even certain things that you take
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.220]   in terms of supplementation
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.780]   that can basically make you feel better,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.000]   more alert, and more capable for everything.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.300]   I don't think that's a hyperbolic statement.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.200]   In fact, I know it's not a hyperbolic statement
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   because we have a system in our body
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.480]   that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.140]   and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.700]   And that communication between brain and body
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.500]   in both directions creates a situation
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.420]   where either we are positioned to do things well
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.820]   or we are positioned to do things poorly.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.980]   So I really want to dive in and dissect
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.260]   what is this system of brain-body communication?
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.100]   What does it look like?
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.020]   What are the actual neurons and connections?
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.660]   And as I do that,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.860]   I promise that I'm going to place protocols,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.220]   tools that you can apply in order to make sure
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.720]   that those neurons and connections are working optimally.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.780]   So let's begin by talking about what system
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.580]   communicates the brain to the body
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.340]   and the body back to the brain.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.680]   The system that's most often associated with this
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.500]   is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.700]   The word vagus relates to the word vagabond,
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.740]   which is to wander.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.480]   And indeed, the vagus nerve is a vast,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.780]   enormous wandering set of nerves.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.760]   So it's not one nerve.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.500]   It's not like one fiber, one axon, as we say.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.060]   In the nervous system, we have these wires we call axons
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.500]   that let neurons communicate.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.760]   It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch of wires
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.600]   that go everywhere.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.520]   So where do they go?
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.600]   Well, they leave the brain and the brain stem.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.380]   The brain stem is kind of the back of your brain.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.500]   If you touch the back of your neck,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.020]   it's about three inches deep to where you're touching.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.180]   The neurons that are there send information into the body
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.860]   to control your bodily organs.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.660]   How fast your heart is beating, how fast you're breathing,
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.020]   how fast your digestion is occurring.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.780]   Even things like whether or not you are going to secrete
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.340]   so-called killer cells, your immune cells from your spleen
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.920]   to go ward off bacteria.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.580]   Now, the neurons there don't know what to do
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.980]   unless they receive information about what's going on
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.140]   within the body.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.180]   And within the body, your heart, your lungs, your diaphragm,
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.540]   your gut, so everything from your intestines
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.900]   to your stomach, et cetera, and your spleen
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.680]   are sending information also up to the brain.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.480]   So as I mentioned before, it's a two-way street.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.240]   So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve,
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.260]   but just by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.600]   it sounds like one thing.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.180]   But actually what we're talking about
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.780]   is a series of super highways.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.740]   It's like Google Maps.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.400]   It's got stuff going everywhere with alternate routes,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   communicating back and forth.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   There are two fundamental features
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.920]   of what's going on in your body
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.220]   that need to be communicated to your brain,
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.960]   these neurons in your brain stem,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.540]   in order for your brain and your body
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.620]   to work together correctly.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.360]   And the two types of information are mechanical information,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.960]   so things like pressure, things like lack of pressure,
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.280]   and chemical information, whether or not your gut is acidic
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.580]   or whether or not it's not acidic,
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.420]   whether or not you have some sort of pathogen,
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.300]   something that you ate or that got into your body somehow
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.100]   and is making you sick,
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.080]   or whether or not you don't have a pathogen in your body.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.980]   So you've got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.020]   So when you think about your sense of self
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.680]   and your ability to understand what's going on in your body,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.980]   if you feel good or if you feel bad,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.480]   your sense of self is dependent
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.980]   on these mechanical phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.900]   And for every organ in your body,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.060]   whether or not that's your heart or your lungs
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.580]   or your spleen,
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.420]   both the mechanical information about that organ,
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.140]   for instance, is if your gut is full or empty,
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.820]   whether or not your heart is beating fast or beating slowly,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.400]   that's mechanical.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.280]   And chemical information, whether or not your gut feels nice
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.000]   and whether, you know, when I say nice,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.540]   I mean whether or not it has a balance of acidity
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.920]   and alkalinity that feels right to you,
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.700]   or whether or not your gut feels off,
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.720]   it doesn't feel quite right, that's chemical information.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.320]   If you are not getting enough oxygen
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.500]   and levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.040]   so your lungs can register that
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.000]   and that chemical information is sent to your brain
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.740]   and then your brain does certain things,
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.600]   actually it really encourages you to do certain things
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.660]   in order to adjust that chemistry.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.960]   So the first principle that everyone should understand
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.800]   about their sense of self
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   is that they are sensing mechanical and chemical information
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.060]   about every organ in their body, except for one,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.500]   and that's the brain.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.200]   Your brain actually doesn't have pain receptors,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.000]   it doesn't even have touch receptors.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.800]   The brain is a command center,
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.140]   it helps drive and govern changes in the organs of the body,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.920]   but your brain doesn't move, at least not much,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.480]   it can move a little bit, fluid moves within it,
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.440]   but as long as you're healthy, it's not moving that much.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.340]   Your brain has no sensation of its own.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.920]   In fact, when they do brain surgery on people,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.040]   they will anesthetize or put some anesthesia on the scalp,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.020]   they'll cut away the skin there
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.640]   so that people don't feel anything,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.200]   they'll use some anesthesia, they'll peel back the skin,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.640]   and then they'll use a, well, let's call it what it is,
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.620]   it's a bone saw,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.960]   and they basically saw open a little window in the skull,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.000]   I've actually done this before and seen this before,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.820]   I've done this many times before,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.940]   and once you're inside the brain,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.760]   you can put electrodes in there
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.640]   and you can put various things in there,
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.800]   of course, all for therapeutic purposes,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.060]   and you do that without any anesthesia
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.220]   to the actual brain tissue
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.120]   because it has no receptors to sense anything.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.920]   It doesn't have pain receptors,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   it doesn't have pressure receptors, none of that.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.040]   When you have a headache
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.520]   and your head feels like there's too much pressure,
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.720]   well, that's because of receptors that lie outside the brain.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.800]   So your organs are different,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.040]   they need to tell your brain what's going on,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.900]   and there are ways that you can control the mechanical
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.480]   and the chemical state of your organs
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.700]   in ways that are very powerful,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.120]   and this is crucial to do
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.080]   because if you can properly regulate
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   the mechanical and chemical environment of your body,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.960]   your brain functions better.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.940]   This is absolutely clear from data
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.320]   that if your gut is healthy,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.720]   if you get the alkalinity right, the acidity right,
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.680]   and if your spleen is healthy and happy,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.800]   and if your lungs are working properly,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.180]   not just breathing and pumping in and out air,
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.640]   but you're breathing at the right cadence
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.220]   for a particular activity,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.700]   then your brain will function better.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.120]   So let's talk about how you can adjust
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.280]   the mechanical and chemical environment of your organs
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.920]   in order to make your brain better,
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.360]   and how your brain can make the mechanical
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.500]   and chemical environment within your organs function better.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.220]   For instance, we're going to talk about
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.880]   how you can change the chemistry of your gut
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.600]   in order for your brain to be able to focus better,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.240]   think better, remember better, and sleep better,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.380]   and we're going to talk about how you can change
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.880]   the chemistry of other organs in your body
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.040]   such that your immune system will function better
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.100]   than it would otherwise,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.460]   and you can actually heal faster from small cuts and bruises,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.900]   but also injuries of any kind, even major injuries.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.860]   So as I mentioned before, we've got these organs,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.100]   the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.760]   and I'll explain what that is, the gut and the spleen,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.500]   and the spleen is this immune organ.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   Let's take one example of these
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.940]   and explain how mechanical and chemical information
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.740]   from this particular set of organs
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.100]   communicates to the brain and how that changes
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.420]   how our brain works.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.060]   And the organ I'd like to focus on first
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.520]   are the lungs and the diaphragm.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.780]   So we're all familiar with our lungs,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.120]   these two big bags of air,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.480]   but they're actually not two big bags of air,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.840]   they actually have little tiny sacs within them,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.600]   actually millions of little sacs
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.680]   called the avioli of the lungs.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.160]   The avioli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.520]   throughout our lungs, and the more of those balloons we have,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.300]   the more air that we can actually contain.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.660]   So we are not two big bags of air in there, our lungs,
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.660]   we actually have millions and millions
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.020]   of little tiny bags of air within those lungs.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.620]   Those little bags of air can fill up or they can deflate,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.660]   just like your lungs overall can fill up
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.180]   or they can deflate.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.620]   The diaphragm is a muscle, it's kind of shaped like a dome,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.820]   so it's kind of, think about a basketball or a soccer ball
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.300]   that has most of the air pushed out of it,
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.060]   and so it's kind of crescent shape or dome shaped,
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.100]   and it sits below our lungs.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.420]   And the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.420]   is very interesting.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.300]   The diaphragm is actually skeletal muscle,
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.540]   so it's just like a bicep or a quadricep,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.120]   and the fact that it is skeletal muscle is important
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.600]   because it has a unique property,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.080]   which is that you can control it voluntarily,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.140]   you can decide to take control of your diaphragm
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.140]   by just consciously deciding you want to breathe
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.380]   in a particular way.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.020]   Just like you can take conscious control over your legs,
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.060]   they will work just fine if you're not thinking about them
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.420]   as you walk, provided you already know how to walk,
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.760]   but at any moment you can decide to change the rate
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.040]   of your walking, your so-called cadence of walking.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.240]   So the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.660]   also has that property.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.740]   The diaphragm moves up and down depending on how you breathe,
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.580]   or rather I should say how the diaphragm moves up and down
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.900]   determines how you breathe.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.980]   How you breathe is also dependent on little muscles
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.340]   that are between your ribs,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.120]   the intercostals and other muscles.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.500]   If you're a martial arts fan, Bruce Lee was famous
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.740]   for having these very pronounced intercostals
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.820]   from doing all sorts of bridging exercise, et cetera,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.140]   but those are the muscles and we all have them
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.280]   even if some of us, most of us don't have intercostals
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.740]   like Bruce Lee.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.540]   So when you breathe, a couple of things happen,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.000]   but let's talk about the mechanical things first
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.860]   and then let's talk about how those mechanical steps
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.520]   relate back to the brain and what that does for the brain.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.460]   And I can promise you that if you develop an awareness
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.260]   of these mechanical changes,
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.060]   you do not have to go through extensive breath work practice
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.000]   or do extensive breath work.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.220]   You will immediately, believe it or not,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.960]   develop a sense of your breathing self,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.480]   of your lungs and diaphragm.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.760]   It takes no practice, but once you do it,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.140]   you will forever be changed in terms of your awareness
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.300]   of your breathing and your ability to leverage
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.580]   your breathing, kind of like the steering wheel on a car
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.960]   in order to shift your brain in the direction
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.800]   that you want to go.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.340]   So it's a very powerful system.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.280]   And the way it works is the following,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.260]   and this will also incorporate the heart.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.220]   So, and by the heart, I don't mean it in the emotional sense.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.460]   Although we don't rule out emotions here
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.720]   at the Huberman Lab Podcast, we like emotions,
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.420]   but I'm talking about the heart as an organ,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.360]   as a beating organ that circulates blood.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   So when we inhale, these little sacs in our lungs fill up
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.440]   and our lungs expand.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.360]   And when we do that, we take up space in our thoracic cavity
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.840]   and our diaphragm moves down, okay?
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.440]   the lungs get smaller, okay?
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.620]   So inhales, diaphragm moves down, exhales,
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.920]   diaphragm moves up.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.440]   This actually controls our heart rate,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.000]   but it does it by changing the way that our brain works.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   And it works in the following way.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.080]   So when we inhale, our lungs fill, our diaphragm moves down,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   our heart actually has a little more space
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   because the diaphragm's moved down.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.680]   So the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.640]   not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.880]   And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.760]   flows at a slower rate because it's a larger volume.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.520]   So bigger volume heart,
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.320]   same amount of blood inside the heart means slower flow,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.300]   okay, sort of like expanding a pipe.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.860]   The brain registers that
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.400]   because there are a set of neurons on the heart
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.560]   called the sinoatrial node.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.600]   It sends that information to the brain.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.900]   That information is registered by the brain
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.320]   and the brain sends a message back to the heart
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.680]   to speed the heart up.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.480]   So every time you inhale,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.360]   because of these mechanical changes in the diaphragm and lungs
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   and because of the mechanical changes in the heart,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.160]   your brain sends a signal to the heart to speed the heart up.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.600]   So if you do long inhales or you inhale more vigorously,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.480]   you actually are speeding your heart up.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.880]   Now, of course, you have to exhale as well.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.940]   But for instance, if I were to inhale very long,
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.760]   like the entire time, my heart rate is increasing.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.720]   And then if I did a quick exhale, something else will happen.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   But if I kept doing that, my heart rate would increase.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.120]   It's not going to increase linearly and forever,
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.000]   but it will increase with each inhale.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.040]   Or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.520]   and my heart rate will speed up.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.340]   This is an autonomic and automatic relationship
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.140]   between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.960]   Now, if inhales speed the heart up, what happens on exhales?
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.080]   When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.160]   It's a little counterintuitive,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.140]   but you can kind of think about it
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.200]   as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.520]   When you exhale, this thing moves up.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.280]   And as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.360]   meaning it gets a little bit smaller,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.920]   which means that whatever volume of blood is inside the heart
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.140]   moves faster through that smaller volume.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.480]   That information is sent to the brain
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.040]   via these collection of neurons
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.400]   called the sinoatrial node, for you aficionados.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.440]   The brain then sends information via the vagus nerve
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.980]   back to the heart to slow the heart down.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.200]   So while inhales speed up the heart, that's the net effect,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.320]   exhales slow the heart down.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.840]   And the reason they slow the heart down
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.080]   is because of a register in the change in mechanical pressure
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.760]   between the diaphragm, the lungs, and the heart.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.280]   So this is, to me,
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.880]   the simplest and most straightforward example
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.320]   of how the brain is changing the way our organs work,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.960]   our heart in this case,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.860]   according to changes in mechanical interoception.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.680]   Now, we're not always aware of this.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.220]   Some of us are aware of it, some of us aren't.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.120]   If you do it right now, you will be aware of it.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.000]   So you can try this.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.280]   Basically, this is an experiment or an example
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.600]   in interoception, in sensing one's self.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.160]   So if you inhale, doesn't matter how long you inhale,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   I'll do it for a couple seconds,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.200]   and then exhale twice as long.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.260]   Nose or mouth, doesn't matter.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.840]   The entire time that you're exhaling,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.040]   you're slowing your heart down.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.760]   So just as a car has an accelerator and a brake,
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.720]   or you can slow a car by coming off the accelerator,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.560]   when you exhale,
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.480]   you're effectively coming off the accelerator,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.400]   or if you want to think about it differently,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.580]   you're hitting the brake,
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.680]   you're slowing down your heart rate.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.520]   Now, normally your heart rate stays in more or less
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.220]   the same range for a given activity
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.440]   because you're inhaling and exhaling.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   But this is just a simple way of showing
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.320]   that mechanical changes in your viscera
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.120]   can change the way that your brain works,
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.880]   and then your brain changes the way that those viscera work.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.440]   And it's a very concrete agreements,
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.880]   like a contract between the organs of your body
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.360]   and the brain.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   In fact, you can think about this contract
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.280]   in more detail,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.440]   and you can leverage this in a very powerful way
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.380]   to set the conditions of your mind.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.260]   If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.400]   And the simplest way to do this,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.400]   I've talked about this many times before,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.640]   but if you haven't heard me say it,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.240]   this will become immediately clear,
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.880]   is to emphasize exhales
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.980]   through what's called a physiological sigh.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.560]   Two inhales could be through the nose or the mouth,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.680]   but ideally through the nose.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.320]   So followed by a long exhale.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.440]   Those double inhales are kind of important
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.200]   because what they do is they maximally fill
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.680]   all those little sacks in your lungs.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.540]   And then when you breathe out,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.000]   you're exhaling as much of the so-called carbon dioxide
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.160]   in your system as possible.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.120]   We'll talk about carbon dioxide in a second.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.800]   So the fastest way to calm down is to emphasize exhales.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.460]   When you make exhales longer,
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.200]   you're slowing your heart rate, you're calming down.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.860]   You don't need any sophisticated training.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.800]   You don't have to do this for minutes on end.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.720]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.980]   You don't even have to call it breath work.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.240]   It's just respiration.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.560]   And in fact, you do this every night when you go to sleep
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.320]   and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream,
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.180]   or if you hold your breath or something,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.400]   or you watch an animal or a small child that's sleeping,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.960]   they will occasionally do these double inhale long exhales.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.480]   It's a way of slowing the heart down
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.580]   and eliminating carbon dioxide.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.520]   The opposite is also true.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.040]   If you inhale deeply or vigorously,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.160]   and then exhale less long or less vigorously,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.200]   you will increase your level of alertness
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.080]   through these purely mechanical aspects
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.880]   of your interoception.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.640]   So for instance, if I were to take a big, deep inhale,
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.200]   and then a short exhale, and then another one,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.700]   big inhale, short exhale,
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.120]   it only takes two or three of those
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.520]   before you start to feel more alert.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.360]   And that's because your heart rate is increasing.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.280]   And actually, if you keep doing that for 25 or 30 breaths
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.440]   of inhale deep, short exhale,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.960]   you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.520]   this hormone that comes from your kidneys
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.620]   and from your brainstem make you feel really alert.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.960]   You will actually feel as if you've had a couple of espresso,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.520]   you will immediately wake up.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.880]   And there's an intermediate form of breathing,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.360]   which is sometimes called box breathing,
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.520]   but it's really equal inhale and exhale duration.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   And these, it basically goes like this.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.400]   You're going to inhale.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.960]   So do this for maybe two, three seconds.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.100]   Inhale, then hold, two, three seconds,
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.040]   then exhale, two, three seconds, then hold, two, three seconds.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.340]   Most often people forget to hold.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.040]   So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.400]   for equal or more or less equal duration.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.240]   So it could be one second, could be two seconds,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.320]   could be three seconds.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.420]   Most people find that when you get out past five seconds,
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.600]   they start to struggle
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.200]   to maintain the so-called box breathing.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.500]   And most people can't consciously box breathe
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.060]   for too terribly long without having to think about it.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.960]   But the point here is that through purely mechanical means,
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.720]   changing the way that you breathe,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.240]   emphasizing inhales or exhales or keeping them the same,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.040]   will change the way that your brain works,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.800]   how alert you are and how well you function in anything.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.160]   And again, this doesn't mean that breath work has no value.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.240]   It's just simply to say
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.120]   that long extended protocols of breath work are simply,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.740]   they are truly simply just an exploration
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.240]   of this fundamental relationship
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.240]   between the mechanics of your internal organs
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.420]   and your brain and how your brain controls
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.080]   those internal organs.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.720]   Now, you might ask, well, how is this pressure known?
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.340]   How does the body actually know how full the lungs are?
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.780]   Now, this is an answer
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.380]   that's more for the aficionados out there,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.500]   but I've had a few requests or I should say thousands
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.800]   of requests for more in-depth science.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.260]   So if you're not interested in more in-depth science,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.760]   just this will allow you to tune out now
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.940]   for maybe just 10 seconds.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.040]   And if you are interested, pay careful attention.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   There is a set of receptors which are called piezo receptors,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.320]   P-I-E-Z-O, piezo receptors.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.760]   Piezo means pressure.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.400]   And these were discovered a few years ago
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.920]   by a couple of different laboratories.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   But one of the main ones,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   one of the main laboratories
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   that discovered these piezo receptors
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.520]   is the laboratory of Ardem Padepuchen.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.540]   I love saying his name,
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.520]   even though I'm probably pronouncing it.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   He's a friend and a former colleague.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.960]   When my lab was down in San Diego,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.760]   he's at the Scripps Institute.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.240]   He's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.620]   which just basically means that he's a total stud of science
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.480]   and has made many important discoveries.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.440]   The piezo receptors line many tissues
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.240]   and inform the brain about pressure in those tissues.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.160]   But the lungs have a particular category of piezo receptors
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.680]   called piezo two receptors.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.260]   And as you fill your lungs [inhales]
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.320]   and these little sacks of air, the alveoli fill,
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.900]   the piezo two receptors,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   because of the way they react to that filling,
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.600]   send information by way of a bunch of neurons,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.900]   a bunch of wires up to the brain
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.720]   and tell you how full your lungs are.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.280]   So that's the kind of mechanistic detail.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.560]   If you want to learn more about that,
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.520]   you can look up Ardem's lab at the Scripps
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.720]   and the beautiful work that they and other laboratories
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.120]   are doing on piezos.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.380]   Piezos are pretty cool.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.200]   I think I also just like saying piezo.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.280]   So that's why I brought that up as well.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.600]   So mechanical sensing of the lungs, heart and diaphragm.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   And now let's talk about chemical sensing
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.560]   because there's carbon dioxide and there's oxygen.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.340]   And this is really simple.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.240]   You have oxygen and carbon dioxide and you need them both.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.200]   I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.000]   as this bad thing and oxygen as a good thing.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.240]   You need them both and you need them
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.900]   in the appropriate balance.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.560]   You have a collection of neurons in your brain
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.160]   that register when carbon dioxide levels
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.040]   get to a certain point in your bloodstream.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.840]   When that point, that threshold is reached,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.680]   these neurons fire and they cause you to breathe.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.060]   It's sometimes called the gasp reflex.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.300]   It just makes you want to inhale.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.800]   And as a consequence, you bring in more oxygen.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.560]   Okay, so we don't really breathe to get oxygen.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.400]   That's a by-product of inhaling
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.120]   to eliminate carbon dioxide.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.620]   In fact, if you want to freak somebody out
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.060]   and we do these in experiments,
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.400]   and I don't recommend you do this,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.580]   you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.640]   that they inhale and the brain will go
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.800]   into an almost immediate panic response
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.000]   because the health of all our tissues depends
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.800]   on keeping a nice balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.320]   You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.360]   So the impulse to breathe, if you're underwater
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.720]   or if you hold your breath, is triggered by these neurons.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.000]   And the triggering of those neurons
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.840]   comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.400]   And for those of you that don't quite know
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.000]   how to conceptualize the relationship
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.260]   between bloodstream and breath, I do think it's important,
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.940]   and maybe you remember this from high school biology,
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.260]   but if you don't, I'll make it clear for you now.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.260]   It's very easy.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.260]   You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.000]   in that air actually move from your lungs
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.140]   into the bloodstream because these little avioli
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.600]   of the lungs, those little sacks of air,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   they basically have a lot of little micro vessels
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.460]   and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.120]   essentially, although they're mostly capillaries,
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   micro capillaries, little tiny ones that line them.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.320]   So there's actually an interface, an opportunity for air
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.260]   and molecules within the air to pass into the blood.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.740]   And then they move in your bloodstream.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.660]   And when you exhale, the opposite is true.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.880]   So you can move things from the air into your bloodstream
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.100]   or from your bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.620]   And there's a lot more detail to it.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.940]   And I'm sure those of you that are experts out there,
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.500]   if you want to put some stuff in the comments,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.980]   maybe a little bit of an kind of intermediate tutorial,
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.680]   you might even title it intermediate tutorial.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.920]   If you know a lot about this, just I'll check it,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.180]   but make sure you get the details right.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.160]   Make sure you know the process.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.900]   And I find that for people that are interested
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.840]   in understanding how breathing really works,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.600]   it's really nice to think about the relationship
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.360]   between the heart and the vascular system,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.280]   the blood and the air system,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.160]   the respiration system and breathing,
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.720]   because those two things are very,
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.200]   we say they're interdigitated,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.300]   they're interwoven with one another.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.940]   So how's this work?
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.140]   Well, carbon dioxide is too high.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.780]   You breathe in, you inspire, you inhale.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.060]   As a consequence, when you exhale,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.000]   you offload carbon dioxide.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.100]   There's a really cool way that you can explore
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.400]   this chemistry of your breathing and your bloodstream
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.500]   and the way that your brain works
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.900]   in ways that can really benefit your health.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.260]   And it works the following way.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.240]   You want to essentially sit or lie down.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.140]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.940]   You definitely don't want to be anywhere near water,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.540]   not a bathtub, not a hot tub,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.220]   not a cold dunk or something.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.680]   In fact, don't even be in a puddle.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.580]   And what you want to do in this case
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.980]   is you're going to breathe in deep,
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.420]   so that's going to increase your heart rate,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.340]   and then exhale passively
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.080]   by just letting air fall out of your mouth.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.580]   So it would look something like this.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.060]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.680]   So let's say you breathe in vigorously
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.780]   and then you let the air just fall out of your mouth.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.100]   When you do that, what you're essentially doing
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.740]   is you're bringing in a lot of oxygen
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.260]   through that deep breath,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.580]   and you're exhaling a little bit of that carbon dioxide.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.300]   But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times,
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.820]   doesn't matter if it's 25 or 30, somewhere in there,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.700]   you would essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.300]   and blowing off or exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.860]   So you're actually going to change the chemistry
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.060]   of your internal landscape, and you can then sense it.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.820]   You can interocept what that is like.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.000]   And there are some really interesting reasons
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.060]   for wanting to do that.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.800]   So I'm not going to do all 25 or 30 now,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.840]   maybe do five or 10 so you can get a sense
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.240]   of what it looks like so that it's clear.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.420]   I'm going to essentially demonstrate now.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.060]   So it's inhale, exhale through the mouth.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.480]   I am inhaling through the nose.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:41.300]   So it's essentially, excuse me,
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.620]   a two-second or so inhale,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.220]   and then a one-second or so exhale.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.060]   And as I was doing that,
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.880]   I can kind of feel my face get flush
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.100]   and my body is heating up and my brain is heating up.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.940]   What's happening there?
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.380]   Well, that pattern of breathing is increasing levels
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.060]   of adrenaline in my brain and body,
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.040]   and I'm getting more alert.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.660]   Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale all your air.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.020]   [exhales]
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.780]   You dump all your air.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.940]   You can do that your nose or your mouth.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.160]   And then you hold your breath with your lungs empty
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.720]   for about 15 to 30 seconds.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.800]   Now, for those of you that want to explore this,
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.880]   and please be careful as you explore this,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.120]   don't do anything stupid like do this while you're driving
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.240]   or something like that.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.200]   You can exhale all your air.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.300]   And what you'll find then is you can hold your breath
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.820]   for a very long time.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.660]   And the reason you can do that is because you've blown off
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.700]   all the carbon dioxide or most of the carbon dioxide
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.540]   in your bloodstream.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.840]   So you've shifted the chemistry of your blood
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.320]   by breathing in a particular way.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.880]   And by doing that, you are no longer triggering these neurons
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.580]   that cause the gasp reflex or the reflex to breathe.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.160]   Now, of course, you have to breathe sooner or later,
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.920]   but what you'll find is if normally your ability
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.200]   to hold your breath is a minute or so
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.260]   before you really feel that gasp reflex kick in,
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.300]   you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.180]   And with some practice, people find that they can start
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.140]   holding their breath for three or four minutes or longer.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.860]   This is actually how free divers do what they do.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.200]   I do not want anyone free diving.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.580]   If you're going to learn free diving,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.620]   please learn it from an expert.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.180]   Many people die trying to teach themselves out of free dive
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.720]   or trying to teach their friends out of free dive
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.280]   when they don't know what they're doing.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.920]   This is not what this is about.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.680]   Again, don't do this anywhere near water,
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.500]   but it is a very interesting exploration
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.340]   of how you can shift the chemistry of your bloodstream
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.800]   by modulating your air, by modulating the mechanics
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.080]   of your diaphragm and lungs,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.160]   and thereby shift the way your mind works, your brain.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.440]   In fact, what you'll notice is that even though
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.400]   during that 25 or 30 breaths, [inhales and exhales]
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.680]   you'll feel very alert.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.980]   When you exhale all your air and you're in the breath hold,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.640]   you will feel very alert, but very, very calm.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.980]   Now, this is interesting because it's a state
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.600]   that we all sort of want to achieve, alert but calm,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.220]   but have a hard time achieving.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.480]   And so for those of you that have a hard time
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.940]   obtaining focus for sake of work
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.680]   or focus for sake of anything, I should say,
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.200]   and when you are able to achieve focus,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.120]   it's through the use of things like stimulants,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.560]   or you feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath,
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.720]   or you have to have four espresso in order to be alert,
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.920]   but then you're too alert, you're jittery, you can't focus.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.960]   This pattern of breathing can lend itself very well
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.920]   to entering states of alert but calm
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.160]   for the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.840]   and then you could repeat it if you want.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.280]   So it's a very useful practice to explore.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.520]   Some of you may be familiar with this practice,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.120]   a so-called Wim Hof breathing.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.700]   Wim Hof is a practitioner of what's called tumor breathing.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.760]   Tumor breathing has been around for centuries.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.880]   And for those of you that are familiar with breath work
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.080]   and yoga practices,
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.240]   I acknowledge that nothing I just described
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   is new based on science.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.880]   However, the science informs why those practices work.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.840]   And just as a little mini editorial,
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.160]   I just want to emphasize as well
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.320]   that one thing that this podcast is really about
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.160]   is trying to remove fancy nomenclature,
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.900]   whether or not it's yogic nomenclature
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.120]   or scientific nomenclature
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.740]   so that people can access protocols.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.920]   Because the moment we start naming things after people
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.080]   or calling them Tumor, et cetera,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.240]   I have no problem with that,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.440]   but it doesn't inform how the practices are done,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.560]   nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.840]   So here I'm trying to teach you the mechanisms.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.080]   And as a final point to that,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.260]   the most powerful form of breathing
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.820]   is the one that takes into account
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.280]   the fundamental mechanisms that else increase heart rate
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.840]   that exhales decrease heart rate,
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.560]   and that carbon dioxide and oxygen
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.020]   relate to the bloodstream and the brain in particular ways.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.460]   Once you understand those components,
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.180]   then you can create your own so-called breath work practices.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.920]   You can breathe in the ways that best serve you,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.120]   as opposed to thinking that one protocol
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.920]   is the best or holy protocol for everything,
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.120]   because it's simply not.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.960]   As a final, final point,
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.560]   I want to say that as you shift the way that you breathe,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.920]   whether or not you're blowing off more carbon dioxide
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   or bringing in more oxygen,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.920]   you are fundamentally changing the chemistry
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.120]   of your internal milieu of your body.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.160]   And that has been shown to have important effects
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.000]   on the way that your immune system functions
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.720]   and the way that you deal with inflammation
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.660]   and all sorts of different sort of things
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.640]   that can enter your body and cause problems
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.220]   or conditions of stress, et cetera.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.140]   So I will explore that further as the episode goes on,
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.880]   but I want to move on to just touch on one other aspect
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.120]   of breathing that's purely mechanical,
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.420]   which I think is very interesting and important,
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.940]   which relates to a particular reflex
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.200]   that you're going to be very familiar with in a second,
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.700]   and that can serve you very well in times of extreme stress.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.980]   The reflex I'm referring to
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.740]   is something called the Herring-Brewer reflex.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.040]   I'm not going to go into details
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.900]   about how the Herring-Brewer reflex works,
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.440]   but it has to do with particular classes of neurons
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.360]   and cells that are called a baroreceptors.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.780]   Those are basically pressure receptors.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.200]   They sense pressure.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.160]   And basically what the Herring-Brewer reflex is about
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.320]   is that when your lung is inflated,
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   your desire to breathe is reduced.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.720]   So you can try that right now.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   You can inhale, huge big dig of air, and hold, okay?
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.140]   Your desire to breathe will kick in later
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   than were you to exhale all your air and hold your breath.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.020]   When you exhale all your air and hold your breath,
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.760]   unless you've done the sort of protocol
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.960]   I described a few minutes ago
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.000]   of doing a bunch of inhales and exhales first
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.020]   in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.720]   Those baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.860]   saying there's no pressure in here.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.700]   There's no pressure in here.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.100]   I got nothing in here.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.940]   You need to breathe.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.760]   You need to breathe,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.940]   and the gas reflex will kick in sooner.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.540]   You can apply that in all sorts of situations
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.340]   related to exercise,
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.140]   related to modulating stress, et cetera.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.220]   So the Herring-Brewer reflex is a very powerful one.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.940]   This is why you take a big deep breath
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.720]   before you go underwater, all right?
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.000]   You're not going to exhale all your air and go underwater.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.480]   If you were to exhale all your air and go underwater,
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.740]   you would absolutely feel the need to come up sooner
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.120]   for a breath of air than had you a full tank, so to speak,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.580]   a full lungs full of air.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.500]   And this is also the way that people teach themselves
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.680]   to feel comfortable underwater.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.660]   So when you learn how to swim,
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.800]   you learn how to swim both by having air in your lungs
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.640]   while you're underwater
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.920]   and no air in your lungs while you're underwater.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.660]   In any event, the Herring-Brewer reflex
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.180]   is yet another dimension to the way
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.440]   that mechanical pressure influences
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.620]   your brain's decision-making
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.000]   about what to do with your body,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.180]   in this case, whether or not to breathe.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.600]   So now I want to shift away from breathing
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.000]   and diaphragm and lungs
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.460]   and move toward another organ within our viscera,
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.240]   which is our gut.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.140]   So this includes our stomach and our intestines,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.540]   our esophagus and so forth.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.980]   It's been said before, both by me and by others,
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.100]   that we are but a series of tubes.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.080]   And indeed, that's true.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.840]   Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.040]   Your brain is actually a tube
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.620]   that connects to your spinal cord, which is also a tube.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.060]   You started off as a tube.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.080]   You were like a churro.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.200]   You know those like churros?
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.400]   I don't know if you're not familiar with churros.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.640]   They're like donuts that are shaped like a tube.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.040]   That's essentially what you look like early in development,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.120]   not long after conception.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.040]   And the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.540]   but you always maintained a hollow through that tube.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.000]   That's why you have what are called ventricles,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.200]   gaps or a space in your brain and spinal cord
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.960]   that run the length of your brain and spinal cord
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.860]   and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   and other things move through that space.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.340]   We're going to return to the ventricles later.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.240]   They are very, very important.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.560]   They're just space filled with fluid, but they do a lot.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.240]   Similarly, your digestive system
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.120]   starts with the tube at your mouth
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.600]   and of course goes down through your throat.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.720]   And then you've got all the elements of the stomach
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.320]   and the intestines, and then it comes out the other end.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   So you are, but a series of different tubes,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.600]   your vascular system, a series of other tubes.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.100]   So your tubes.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.720]   The way your digestive system works
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.120]   is to communicate to your brain about the status
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.080]   of the mechanical pressures along this tube.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.280]   So within your stomach and your intestines, et cetera,
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.720]   and the chemical status of that tube
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.520]   at various portions within that tube
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.920]   to inform your brain about how your brain
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.260]   should control that tube.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.060]   So let's start with the mechanical sensing of your gut.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.120]   If you drink a lot of fluid or if you eat a lot of food,
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.040]   your gut will fill up, your stomach will fill up with food.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.240]   Now it gets digested there.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.800]   It gets digested elsewhere along your digestive tract too,
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.400]   of course, but it starts getting digested there
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.480]   because along this tube, you have a series
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.680]   of what are called sphincters,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.920]   which basically are like little draw pulls.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.160]   Have you ever had a laundry bag
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.960]   where it has a drawstring on it and you pull it
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.240]   and then it cinches shut and then you can open it again?
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.300]   That's what those are.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.020]   Those are sphincter openings.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.300]   And you have them in your throat.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.720]   You have them along your digestive tract
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.820]   all the way to the end.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.060]   Food will enter your gut.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.280]   And if there's a lot of that food, pressure receptors,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.680]   some of which are these piezo receptors,
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   will communicate to the areas of your brain
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.760]   that are involved in feeding and will say,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.900]   don't eat anymore.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.460]   You don't need to consume anymore.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.860]   Now, some people bypass that.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.480]   I guess they have these like hotdog eating competitions.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.220]   I'm always struck by how some of those people
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.640]   seem to be rail thin,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.040]   but they actually train for those competitions
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.420]   by ingesting large volumes of water.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.840]   Actually a very dangerous practice.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.240]   You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.720]   and you can kill yourself by ingesting too much
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.800]   of anything really to expand your gut.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.080]   Not a good practice, not a big fan of those competitions.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.040]   But even if you're one of those people
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.880]   or you're the world heavyweight champion of them,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.120]   they are informative toward what I'm talking about now,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.840]   which is that as you expand the gut,
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.700]   a signal is sent by neurons,
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   literally nerve cells that are in the gut to the brainstem,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.900]   up to the areas of the brain that are involved in feeding.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.520]   I did a whole episode on feeding.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.960]   You can find on feeding metabolism and hunger.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.740]   You're welcome to listen to that episode if you like.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.440]   And it will shut down the neurons
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.840]   that drive the desire to put more stuff in your mouth.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.920]   That thing that people say sometimes on,
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.360]   well, in this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   I can't put another bite in my mouth.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.460]   Literally they shut down some of the basic movements
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.540]   of the musculature to take another fork bite.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.380]   I know it sounds crazy,
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.640]   but they can actually control your brain.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.780]   So your gut is so full that it's controlling your brain
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.320]   such that this action of spooning food
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.260]   towards your mouth is actually inhibited.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.620]   It's made more difficult or less likely to occur.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   It's incredible.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.440]   The converse is also true.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.580]   When these piezo receptors signal to the brain
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.320]   that the gut is empty,
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   independent of your need, your actual need for food,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.520]   there's a signal that sent to your brain
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.400]   that says gut is empty and neurons get stimulated
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.020]   in areas like the arcuate nucleus
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.320]   and these areas of the hypothalamus, et cetera,
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.220]   that drive the desire to make this action to open the mouth
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.400]   and to put stuff in it, in particular food.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.300]   So when you find yourself at the refrigerator
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.340]   or you find yourself almost manically
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.660]   trying to get food of different kinds,
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.180]   you're not even thinking about what you're eating
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.720]   because you're so hungry.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.220]   In part, that's because the lack of food in your gut
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.420]   has sent that information to your brain
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.620]   and is driving particular fixed action patterns
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.700]   that are associated with eating.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.900]   In fact, one of the first things children learn how to do
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.420]   is open their mouth when something is presented to it.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.060]   And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:54.900]   They're not very good at it.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.020]   First, they get all over the place,
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.540]   but eventually they get good at it,
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.620]   or at least most people get good at it.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.140]   If you watch how people eat,
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.860]   it's kind of very variable out there.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.860]   In any event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.620]   And this purely mechanical phenomenon
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.880]   is driving our brain to drive certain behavior.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.740]   You can get better at registering sense of fullness
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.420]   or lack of fullness in a very particular way.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.640]   Some people have a very keen sense
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.080]   of how full or empty their stomach is.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.740]   So if you've eaten anything,
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.220]   even if it's a small volume of food
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.200]   in the last hour to three hours,
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.880]   it's actually a worthwhile practice to take a few moments,
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.420]   maybe 10, 20 seconds,
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.900]   and actually just try and concentrate on sensing
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.040]   the neurons in your gut and how full you are.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.060]   Like for instance, I ate a few hours ago,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.280]   then I had a little snack about 30 minutes ago or so,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.260]   and my gut feels neither terribly full nor terribly empty.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.000]   It's kind of, I would put it at kind of like 30, 40%, okay?
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.560]   So by just taking conscious awareness
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.520]   of how full or empty our gut is at various times,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.780]   between meals, after a meal, before a meal,
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.560]   you can very quickly develop a sense
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.060]   of how full or empty you are.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.760]   Now, what's the consequence of that?
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.840]   The consequence of that is actually rather interesting.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.400]   It's been shown that the consequence of that
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.820]   is actually that you can better override
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.000]   the signals of these piezo receptors
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.160]   and gut fullness or emptiness.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.900]   So for those of you that find that you eat
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:28.160]   kind of compulsively or non-consciously
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.120]   or subconsciously, I should say,
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.520]   you probably have to be conscious enough to be awake to eat,
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.660]   but subconsciously, you just find yourself eating,
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.160]   and here I'm describing myself.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.040]   I'm a drive-by blueberry eater.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.880]   If there's a bowl of blueberries,
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.000]   every time I walk past it,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.320]   I sort of have to grab a handful of them
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.760]   and pop them in my mouth.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.060]   But if you develop this sense of how much mechanopressure,
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:48.900]   it's not really a word,
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.200]   but how much mechanosensation is in your gut,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.980]   very quickly you can learn to override that.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.680]   You might ask, why would I want to be able to override
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.320]   whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full?
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.040]   Well, there are many reasons to want to do that.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.640]   Many people right now are interested
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.200]   in so-called intermittent fasting.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.060]   They're doing fasts of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.460]   every 24-hour cycle.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.080]   That's actually what my practice is.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.260]   I do that on a regular basis.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.400]   Sometimes, yeah, I eat breakfast,
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.860]   but normally I push breakfast out till about 11 or noon
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.060]   or sometimes a little later.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.580]   Some people are doing longer fasts,
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.560]   and there are really wonderful data
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.360]   published in excellent journals
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.840]   from my colleague Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.920]   of Biological Studies,
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.440]   and of course from other laboratories
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.520]   showing that intermittent fasting
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.200]   can and will have some positive health effects
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.920]   on things like liver health and brain health
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.680]   and other aspects of health.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.780]   Whether or not it's the best form of dieting
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.320]   for the sake of losing weight, that's very controversial,
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.360]   but it's clear that having a period of fasting
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.220]   every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.540]   can be beneficial because it stimulates what's called
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.340]   autophagy, the clearing away or the body's ability
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.540]   to eat certain dead cells, so-called senescent cells.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.740]   And for many people, they struggle with fasting
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.480]   because they feel they have a very keen sense
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.500]   of their stomach being empty,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.540]   and they feel as if they have to eat.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.980]   And in a kind of counterintuitive way,
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.340]   there's some data that indicate that being able to sense
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.940]   whether or not your gut is full or empty
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.060]   and just the knowledge that that's communicating information
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.220]   to your brain about whether to not to eat or not.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.780]   Just that awareness, that understanding
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.380]   allows them to override the signal.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.220]   They think, oh, you know,
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.500]   I'm not actually in need of nutrients right now.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.460]   It's just that my stomach is empty
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.500]   and these piezo receptors and some other ones
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.260]   that I'll tell you about in a moment
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   are signaling to my brain that it's empty.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.620]   I don't actually need food.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.020]   It's just that my brain is reacting to the fact
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.780]   that my gut is deflated, so to speak, or is smaller,
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.380]   doesn't have food in it.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.520]   So there are other ways
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.380]   that our guts communicate with our brain.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.640]   It's not just our stomach talking to our brain.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.400]   It's also our intestines talk to our brain.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.900]   The Lieberle's lab, the guy's name is Steven Lieberle's.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.420]   He runs a lab at Harvard Medical School,
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.300]   his terrific lab, does excellent work
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.760]   on gut brain communication
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.740]   and other aspects of viscera brain communication.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.260]   They discovered a category of neurons
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.340]   called the GLP-1R neurons.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.660]   These are neurons that are basically in your neck.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.660]   I mean, they're part of the nervous system,
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.420]   but they can be found near your neck.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.220]   And those neurons send little wires down
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:31.140]   into the intestines and deep into the stomach,
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.720]   but mostly into the intestines,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.660]   and they sense stretch of your intestines.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.780]   So this is pretty wild.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.340]   These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines are
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.740]   and how fast things are moving through your intestines,
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.700]   slow or fast, or if there's nothing there.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.140]   And then those neurons send another branch.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.620]   So they have a branch in one direction,
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.340]   senses what's going on in your intestines,
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.040]   and they have another branch that goes up from your neck
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.140]   into your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.680]   or just stop eating.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.060]   So these are really, really cool neurons,
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.420]   and they're basically stretch receptors.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.180]   They look a lot like the piezo receptors
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.660]   that we talked about before.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.820]   So these GLP-1R neurons are sensing stretch,
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.140]   so purely mechanical sensing.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.860]   And in addition to that,
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.500]   the Lieberle's lab discovered neurons
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.040]   that detect nutrients themselves.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.580]   Now, the main reason why we need to eat
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.580]   is to bring nutrients into our body.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.980]   And there is another set of neurons,
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.700]   those are called GPR-65 neurons,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.060]   if you want to know that you don't have to remember that,
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.900]   that do the same thing in terms of their connections.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.720]   They send connections down into the intestines
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.780]   and into the gut, into the stomach,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.980]   but mostly into the intestines,
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.840]   and then send that information back up to the brain
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.020]   as to whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.100]   in our digestive tract.
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.320]   Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.340]   if we're talking about chemical signaling.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.180]   And in the next couple of minutes,
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.780]   I'm going to tell you about how you can understand hunger
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.840]   and how to modulate your hunger for the right foods,
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.220]   in fact, for healthy foods.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.360]   The way this is done is by leveraging the activity
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.620]   of these GPR-65 neurons,
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.040]   these neurons that sense nutrients, okay?
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.460]   They're telling your brain what's in your gut
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.520]   and intestines.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.180]   And you have another set of neurons
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.780]   that were discovered by another guy.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.300]   He's out at Duke University.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:20.820]   His name is Diego, excuse me, Diego, Diego Borges.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.580]   He's a wonderful scientist.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.020]   He has a degree in nutrition, but also in neuroscience.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.740]   And he found that there are neurons that line the gut,
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:33.260]   and those neurons, in collaboration with these GPR-65 neurons
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.780]   are sensing for three things, okay?
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.500]   So we say nutrients, which nutrients are they looking for?
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.380]   What are these neurons paying attention to?
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.940]   Well, these neurons are activated
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.820]   by the presence of fatty acids,
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.740]   in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.260]   sorts of things that come from fatty fish, fish oil, krill,
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:56.260]   certain kinds of animal and plant substances.
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.060]   You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:02.300]   And those omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.020]   like crazy up to the brain
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.380]   and make you want to eat more of those things,
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.020]   but it turns out in pretty appropriate levels.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.500]   These neurons also respond to amino acids.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.500]   So when you eat a food, it's broken down in the gut.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.660]   Actually, the way it's broken down in the gut
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.600]   is kind of interesting.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.920]   Your gut basically cinches off a sphincter up top,
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.980]   cinches off a sphincter below it when there's food there.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.420]   And then you have a series of smooth muscles
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.020]   that tumble the food and literally physically break it down.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.860]   And then of course,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.900]   enzymes come in and start digesting the food.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.300]   And we're going to talk about digestion
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.260]   and how that's communicated to the brain in a moment.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.340]   And for those of you with any autoimmune issues
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.920]   or digestive issues,
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.140]   this is going to be a very important conversation.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.220]   But meanwhile, there are these neurons in the gut.
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.300]   And as these fatty acids float out of the digested food,
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.700]   so literally fat molecules,
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:55.920]   and as amino acids are coming from the proteins
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.960]   as they're digested in the gut,
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.000]   and as a third food item,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.320]   sugars are coming from the foods that we eat.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.140]   These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says,
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.480]   "Hey, whatever you're doing up there, do more of it."
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.660]   Now the sugars are a little bit cryptic
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.420]   because when I say sugars, or I say amino acids,
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   or I say fatty acids, this has nothing to do with taste.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.660]   In fact, beautiful experiments have been done
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.980]   by the Borges lab and by other labs showing
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.900]   that even if you numb the mouth,
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.260]   even if you gavage, which is a really just a,
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.020]   it's a fancy word for basically tube feeding,
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.140]   you put a tube down in the gut,
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.340]   you just deliver the food to the gut
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.340]   so you get no opportunity to taste it.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.460]   Sounds pretty awful.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.060]   If you force feed by gavage, or you numb the mouth,
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.680]   these neurons don't care about the mouth,
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.080]   they only care about the nutrients coming from these foods,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.380]   and then they signal to the brain,
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.320]   "Hey, do that thing, do that thing where you lift
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.400]   that object we call a fork or a spoon,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.440]   do that thing where you drink the milkshake,
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.560]   do that thing where you move your mouth like this,
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.980]   not talking, but do that thing where you swallow."
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.020]   So that's how the nutrients in our gut control us,
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.240]   and this is why for people
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.800]   that experience extreme sugar cravings,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.580]   or even mild sugar cravings,
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.420]   replacing those foods with foods
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.860]   that have high levels of omega-3 or amino acids
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.220]   can reduce sugar cravings,
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.640]   and I've talked about this on a previous episode,
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.980]   but if you didn't catch it, no big deal,
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.720]   I'll tell you right now that for many people,
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.800]   the solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount,
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.080]   maybe a teaspoon or so, of an amino acid called glutamine,
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.660]   and if you have really extreme sugar cravings,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.980]   you can even mix that glutamine with a full fat cream,
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.580]   which actually makes it taste pretty darn good,
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.980]   and you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving,
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.160]   just a sip or two of that,
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.940]   and what you find is that the sugar cravings disappear
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.280]   because you're basically giving fat and amino acids
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.980]   to those neurons in the gut and in the intestine
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.120]   that signal to the brain that you want more.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.160]   Now, this doesn't give you a kind of runaway hunger
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.340]   for full fat cream,
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.480]   although it will say when I was in high school
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.240]   for various reasons,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.940]   but mostly 'cause I liked the way it tastes,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.900]   I was using half and half in my cereal,
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.980]   and I was waking up in the middle of the night
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:01.940]   and drinking half and half,
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.220]   and that stuff tastes pretty darn good
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.000]   once you get used to the high fat content,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.740]   not something I do now,
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:11.400]   but the point is these neurons don't really know taste,
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.780]   they only know nutrients,
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.300]   and so you can work with that system.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.760]   If you crave sugar,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.060]   and I do believe that most, if not all of us,
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.300]   should be trying to limit, if not eliminate,
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.860]   simple sugars as much as possible most of the time,
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.220]   then things like glutamine,
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.740]   things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera,
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.820]   maybe even want to supplement with fish oil
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.500]   or something similar to get omega-3s,
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.380]   there are other reasons for wanting to do that too,
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.460]   can be very beneficial,
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.320]   and here's what we're talking about is interoception.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.380]   It's your ability to sense your inner real estate,
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.860]   but in this case by way of chemical signaling,
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.900]   not by way of mechanical signaling.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.100]   So now I'd like to talk about another aspect
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:55.580]   of gut chemistry that has profound effects on the brain
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.340]   as well as on the immune system,
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.760]   and for those of you with autoimmune conditions
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.600]   or for those of you that know people
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.140]   with autoimmune conditions,
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:06.080]   this is going to be a very important discussion.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.640]   Your gut needs to maintain a certain level
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.100]   of acidity or alkalinity.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.260]   For those of you without any chemistry background,
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.020]   basically the low numbers on the pH scale,
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.400]   that means more acidic.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.320]   The higher the numbers, more alkaline.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.380]   So more alkaline means more basic and acidic means acidic,
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.080]   and it has to do with the number of hydrogen atoms
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:28.920]   and all this other stuff,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.680]   you don't need to worry about that right now.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.060]   We're not going to pH your gut right now,
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.200]   but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.140]   Your gut needs to be more acidic
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.320]   than essentially all other tissues of your body
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.900]   in order to function properly.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:44.440]   Bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.140]   I think this is important for people to understand.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.980]   People are always thinking,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.380]   oh, you should be more alkaline, being acidic,
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.380]   that almost sounds like being inflamed.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.300]   Well, it's a complicated discussion,
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.940]   but I think the semantics can be confusing sometimes.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.340]   You want your gut to be acidic.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.540]   You may ask, well, why are people taking anti-acids?
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.680]   Well, those anti-acids are there for a particular purpose
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.660]   to essentially combat acid reflux,
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:12.520]   which is the sending up of stuff in the gut
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.620]   towards the esophagus,
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.340]   and it can cause heartburn and things of that sort.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.600]   And the way that anti-acids work
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.900]   is they essentially cause the sphincters
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.060]   above the gut to cinch shut,
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.300]   but they really are only dealing with a symptom,
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.740]   not the cause.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.460]   So rewind about 10, 20 years ago,
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.440]   the discussion about gut acidity
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.160]   was quite a bit different than it is now
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.980]   in the scientific and medical literature.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.860]   In fact, for many years,
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.500]   long before I'm going to say it here,
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.020]   people have been saying that it's important
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:47.300]   to maintain proper acidity of the gut,
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.020]   but the science and medical professions
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.380]   sort of looked at that as a kind of a scants,
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.820]   like, you know, what's going on there?
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.160]   I don't know that there's any evidence
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.340]   that that's actually true.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.980]   There are communities of people that were prescribing,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.820]   or I should say,
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.040]   recommending that people take hydrochloric acid, HCL,
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.540]   and adjusting gut acidity that way,
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.860]   and it was kind of frowned upon.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.360]   Now, in looking over the peer-reviewed literature,
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.940]   it's clear that this business
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.820]   of trying to make the gut a little more acidic
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.400]   is actually one way in which people treat
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.940]   or try and ameliorate acid reflux.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.100]   So it's kind of counterintuitive,
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.860]   increasing acidity in the gut
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.780]   to try and reduce acid reflux.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.140]   I thought you're supposed to take antacids.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.680]   Well, the field has shifted quite a bit,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.300]   and so we're going to review what it is
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.320]   to maintain the chemistry of the gut
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.600]   at a slightly more acidic level,
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.440]   or a more acidic level, I should say,
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.700]   because it turns out that there are a number of things
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.280]   that are in gut, I just call it what it is,
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.600]   it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.480]   but gastric juices are actually powerful modulators
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.640]   of brain state.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.540]   Put differently, one of the best things that you can do
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.700]   to have a healthy brain, a well-functioning brain,
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.300]   and a healthy and well-functioning body
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.400]   is to maintain proper gut chemistry,
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.420]   and that's basically accomplished
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.620]   by getting the right level of acidity
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.380]   and alkalinity in your gut.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.380]   Now, this is not quack pseudoscience,
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.500]   this is not based on cleanses or anything of that sort.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.380]   What we're going to talk about now are peer-reviewed data
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.780]   in very high quality journals like the journal Cell,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.380]   which is one of the three apex journals,
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.740]   Science, Nature, Cell,
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.220]   and journals of that sort that point to the gut microbiome
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.460]   and its relationship to acidity of the gut
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.260]   and how the gut microbiome
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.780]   can help enhance autoimmune function
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.220]   and various other aspects of brain and body health.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.460]   So within all the mucosal line tissues of our body,
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.740]   we have what are called microbiota,
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.980]   little microorganisms that we didn't make
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.020]   that actually come from our environment or our food
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.100]   and live inside us.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.560]   And there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.140]   Whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.140]   depends on one thing.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.200]   And that one thing is how acid or alkaline
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.180]   the given mucosal tissue is.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.700]   So we actually have a microbiome in our nose.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.240]   And just as a very brief aside,
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.860]   because I'd be remiss if I didn't say this,
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.080]   if you emphasize nasal breathing most of the time,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.680]   except when speaking or eating,
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.240]   and if you downplay mouth breathing,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.920]   meaning you refrain from mouth breathing,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.340]   especially in sleep,
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.020]   you improve the nasal microbiome.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.700]   It gets better at fighting off infections.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.140]   This was shown in a beautiful paper
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.600]   published in Cell Reports last year.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.140]   And that paper I should mention was performed in humans.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.960]   So you got a microbiome in your nose
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.540]   and by nasal breathing most of the time,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.380]   not all the time,
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.460]   'cause there can be times when you need to breathe
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.760]   through your mouth for whatever reason,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.320]   hard exercise or eating or speaking,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.400]   but by breathing through your nose most of the time,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.580]   you are creating an additional layer of immune defense
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.620]   against particles that could get you sick.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.000]   Whereas when you mouth breathe,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   you are taking down a layer of defense
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.120]   and you're putting yourself more at risk of infection.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.620]   This is what this paper shows.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:14.480]   You also have a gut microbiome that is in your throat,
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.320]   in your stomach and in your intestines.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.920]   And that gut microbiome is extremely powerful
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.720]   in regulating your mood and your immune function.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.160]   Now, this is not something that you can sense directly.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.600]   You don't know when you have a bunch of good microbiota
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.300]   or a bunch of bad microbiota
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.940]   because you can feel them moving around in there.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.160]   Actually, that would be pretty awful.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.100]   That would be pretty creepy feeling.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.520]   Rather, according to whether or not your gut is alkaline
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.820]   or acidic in the appropriate ways,
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.960]   you will populate your gut with the appropriate microbiota.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   So you want your stomach to be pretty acidic,
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.240]   but other elements of your digestive tract
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.180]   are going to be more pH.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.880]   And basically there's a gradient,
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.880]   meaning there's a low to high pH gradient along the gut.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.720]   You don't have to know what the pH
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.100]   should be at any one given point,
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.400]   because you're not going to go and put microbiota
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.440]   at one location and not another.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.020]   What you essentially want to do is create an environment
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.680]   where the proper microbiota can thrive.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.440]   Because when you do that,
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.500]   you greatly decrease what are called inflammatory cytokines.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.920]   So these are things that are secreted
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.420]   both by cells within the body and cells within the brain
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.020]   to impact brain health and brain function and bodily health.
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.140]   They go by a particular name.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.340]   So there's something called TNF alpha,
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.620]   tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.020]   It is inflammatory.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.000]   It's not a good thing to have at elevated levels.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.900]   You have something called interleukin-6, IL-6.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.820]   Also causes inflammation, causes damage to tissues.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.700]   Not a good thing to have for elevated
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.180]   for long periods of time.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.420]   And then you have anti-inflammatory cytokines,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.940]   things like interleukin-10, which reduce inflammation.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.620]   And there are hundreds of these,
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.820]   if not thousands of these different cytokines,
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.540]   some of which promote inflammation,
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.100]   some of which reduce inflammation.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   The simple way to adjust these things in the proper ratios
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.020]   is to adjust your gut microbiome.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.900]   The best way to adjust your microbiome
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.540]   is to ingest certain types of foods.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.060]   So there is a beautiful literature on this now,
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.680]   but the most important literature
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.580]   is the one that I referred to
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.260]   at the beginning of this episode,
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.060]   which is what to ingest and what not to ingest
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.340]   in terms of foods in order to create
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.620]   the best conditions in your gut
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.220]   so that you can create the best conditions
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.380]   in your brain and body.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:40.620]   There was a study done by my colleague Justin Sonnenberg
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.620]   Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.380]   in the building at Stanford where I work.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.760]   And they explored how different foods
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   or different diets, I should say,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.660]   impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.780]   And this is a beautiful study
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.660]   because it was done in hundreds of human patients.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.460]   These actually weren't patients that were sick.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:06.280]   I should say human subjects that were otherwise healthy
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.460]   from a huge variety of backgrounds.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.720]   So you had men, you had women,
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.260]   you had people of different races, different, yeah,
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.600]   ethnicities, you had a huge range of backgrounds
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.140]   and they tracked all of that.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.100]   And what they did is they explored two types of diets.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.140]   One is a high fiber diet.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.860]   So dietary fibers are non-digestible
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.940]   or only partially digestible carbohydrates typically.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.620]   And they compared that to diets that were unchanged
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.140]   except for the inclusion of a few to a few more servings
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.940]   of fermented foods each day, things like sauerkraut,
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:38.960]   things like kimchi.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.100]   They even explored, sounds pretty disgusting to me,
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.180]   but who knows, I've never tried it,
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.620]   which is fermented cottage cheese.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.420]   And what they found was that after initial period
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.580]   of a few weeks where they had people
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.100]   either eat a lot of fiber
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.660]   or eat one or two servings of fermented foods,
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.100]   they had those people ramp up their ingestion
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.700]   of either fiber or fermented foods.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.160]   So they kind of ease them into it.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.380]   So they went baseline, then ramp up
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.940]   to the point where they were ingesting
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.780]   four or five servings of fiber
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:10.380]   or of fermented foods per day, which sounds like a lot,
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.380]   but for fermented foods,
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:14.180]   that would be four or five tablespoons
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.140]   of sauerkraut or kimchi.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.100]   It's not quite, it's not like huge platefuls
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   of fermented foods.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.420]   And then they looked at a number of things.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.700]   They looked at the proteome,
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.380]   which is a kind of like looking at the genome,
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.620]   but a bunch of proteins that are made in the body.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.860]   And they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.980]   And they did this by blood draw, which is great.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.380]   It's a real power of this study.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.580]   In fact, the most comprehensive study that I'm aware of.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.340]   By looking at these different tissues
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.960]   across long periods of time,
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.220]   so many, many weeks,
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:46.160]   and then returning people to the diet that they were on
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.120]   before they went into the study,
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.380]   they were able to establish in a causal way
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.560]   how ingesting fiber or fibrous foods
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.420]   versus ingesting these fermented foods on a daily basis
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.060]   could impact the gut microbiome
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.240]   and many, many inflammatory markers
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.900]   and many, many markers of immune function
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.920]   and autoimmune function.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.020]   And the takeaway message from this study
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.520]   is that the fermented foods
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.220]   far outperformed the high fiber diet.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:18.440]   In fact, the high fiber diet in some people was beneficial
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.300]   and in other people caused issues with inflammation.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.240]   This is very different than what I was taught growing up
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.840]   and what many of us were taught.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.780]   Interestingly, they also observed
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.920]   that people that ate the high fiber diet
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.560]   had increases in certain enzymes
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.860]   that lend themselves to better digestion of carbohydrates.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.300]   And I think there's an important insight to come from this.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.320]   Nowadays, we kind of live in the age of extremes
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.600]   where people seem to either want to be carnivore,
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.260]   like never ingest a vegetable.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.300]   I hear they don't even, they're like allowed pepper,
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.580]   but they're not even allowed, you know,
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.900]   sauerkraut or something like very extreme
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.700]   or pure plant-based, pure vegan,
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.020]   or pure, so essentially pure carbohydrate
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.520]   or pure animal protein, very extreme.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.580]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.100]   I like to eat a mixture of different things
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.940]   at different times of days, but very extreme.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.460]   But this is interesting because what these data show
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.960]   is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate,
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.020]   high fiber diet, which is really what these,
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.440]   the high fiber condition really was,
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.500]   actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   This may explain why people who are used to a kind of
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.860]   more paleotype or carnivore type diet
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.340]   might eat carbohydrates and say,
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.380]   "Oh, that doesn't work for me. I don't feel good."
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.820]   It might also explain why people who predominantly
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.500]   eat plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.040]   will try eating meat as an experiment
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.980]   or because they lost a bed or whatever it is,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   and they'll do, or desperation or they'll do that.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.740]   And then they'll say, "Oh, I don't feel good
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.780]   when I eat meat."
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.820]   How good you feel, it seems,
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.060]   how well you can utilize that food
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.540]   and how much of that food you crave
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:59.300]   may be determined, in fact, it appears is determined
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.580]   by your food eating history, the types of food you eat.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.680]   And I think this might explain some of the divide
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.860]   and hopefully might bridge some of the chasm
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.500]   between these different groups that are saying
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.780]   it should be one way or it should be another.
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:15.660]   But at the core of the study was the bigger message.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:18.420]   The bigger message is that all of us
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.240]   should be ingesting on a regular basis, daily basis,
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.240]   two to four servings of fermented foods of different kinds.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.800]   And why I say that is because
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.060]   the inflammatory markers went down,
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:35.060]   the markers of autoimmune disruption went down
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:38.180]   and the chemistry of the gut, therefore,
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.260]   was adjusted in the appropriate ways.
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.220]   Now, it's not to say that high fiber is bad
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.860]   or that fiber is bad, I don't want people to confuse this,
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.500]   but even though this is a discussion about interoception,
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:51.420]   about sensing the self, this is a subconscious mechanism
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.640]   by which the gut communicates to many, many organs,
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.620]   including the brain.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.980]   And it's been shown in other studies,
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.060]   also in quality peer review journals,
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:04.400]   that when the correct gut microbiota are present
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.200]   and these inflammatory markers are reduced,
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.000]   cognition improves, so ability to focus,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.560]   ability to sleep, ability to ward off infection
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.460]   and wound healing all enhanced.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.500]   In fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.880]   in people that struggle with various mental conditions
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.580]   or disorders of the mind,
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.780]   improving the gut microbiome seems to have powerful effects
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.220]   on improving brain symptoms.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.080]   Along the lines of autoimmunity,
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.940]   there are a number of conditions
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.040]   that we call autoimmune conditions,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.460]   and we will do entire episodes about these going forward,
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:41.060]   but for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome,
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.540]   for people with Crohn's disease,
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.220]   for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's,
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.220]   which is a kind of an immune system self-attack
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.160]   on one's thyroid gland,
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.020]   and things like eczema, skin conditions,
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.760]   adjusting the gut microbiome has been shown to be useful
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.180]   in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of those.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.980]   Will it fix those conditions entirely?
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:04.820]   Probably not.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.800]   But can it have a significant positive impact on them?
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.760]   Probably yes.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.860]   There is one thing that's worth mentioning in that list,
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.380]   which is leaky gut.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.320]   What is leaky gut?
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.320]   Here we're talking about the guts.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.140]   What is it to have a leaky gut?
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:17.980]   It sounds awful.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.780]   It sounds like something sort of like leaking out
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.460]   the end of the tube and maybe that too, I don't know.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:26.140]   But leaky gut is actually because your gut
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.460]   is not a tube that's continuous one cell,
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.140]   it's actually made up of many, many cells,
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.900]   and those cells form a barrier
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.260]   and they form what are called tight junctions.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.700]   So if you have two cells and you want to create a fence
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.860]   out of those cells, you bind them together.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.140]   The way that the body does this is to bind them together
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.500]   with what are called tight junctions.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.460]   These are, they go by names like cloudins
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.180]   and things like that if you want to look them up.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.820]   These tight junctions form a nice barrier
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.740]   like a cyclone fence that things can't get past,
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.940]   but like a cyclone fence, only molecules of a certain size
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.840]   can go through those holes.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.180]   So you're not going to pass a soccer ball
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.180]   through an intact cyclone fence, but you could pass,
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.740]   for instance, a feather through that fence.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:09.340]   So leaky gut is when the conditions in the gut
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:14.240]   are too alkaline or the gut microbiota are off in the gut,
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   meaning microbiota that like alkaline guts are living there
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.360]   and those tight junctions can't function
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.860]   at that particular pH
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.660]   and you create little holes in that fence.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.660]   And then what happens is when you ingest foods,
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.220]   some of those foods literally leak out of the gut
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.740]   and into the extracellular space and into the bloodstream.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.860]   And because foods include proteins
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:44.540]   and antibodies react to proteins,
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.820]   what ends up happening in leaky gut,
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.860]   and the reason we talk about it in autoimmune conditions
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.300]   is that you start developing antibodies
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.500]   to particular food proteins.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.180]   And then people start feeling like they have food allergies
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.220]   and they do, they actually create particular food allergies.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.860]   Now, one way to prevent leaky gut
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.420]   is to get the rest of the gut situation happy
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.300]   by ingesting the proper foods that we talked about before,
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:09.820]   ingesting fermented foods on a regular basis.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.220]   The other is our old friend glutamine again.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.920]   There are some data,
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.660]   and I should say it's a limited number of studies,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.820]   showing that ingesting glutamine
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.560]   anywhere from one to three teaspoons per day
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.340]   can help alleviate leaky gut.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.520]   Now, the mechanism for that still isn't clear
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.900]   whether or not it's adjusting pH
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.860]   or whether or not it's creating more favorable environment
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.260]   for the microbiota,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.620]   but it is clear that supplementing with glutamine
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.220]   can in some people enhance,
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.940]   or I should say improve conditions of leaky gut.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.540]   So that might be useful as well.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.900]   And then the final thing about this
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.740]   that I want to talk about
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.660]   as we're talking about chemical sensing in the gut
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:53.340]   and how that impacts wellbeing is about gut acidity.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.500]   And this, I confess is a little bit controversial.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.500]   Some people are on board this, other people are not.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.420]   And so I'd love your feedback on this.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   If you agree, please tell me.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.140]   If you disagree, please tell me,
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.120]   but please tell me why you disagree in particular.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.940]   Experience or data, although it's always better
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.420]   if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.060]   There is a practice that some people embrace.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.900]   I'm not recommending people necessarily do this
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.740]   and you would definitely want to talk to your doctor,
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.060]   but where people have food allergies
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.460]   or they're having mood or autoimmune issues
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.220]   and they treat this,
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.500]   some people recommend treating this
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.820]   through the ingestion of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.980]   Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.020]   Acids can burn you.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.460]   They literally can melt away skin.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:43.020]   You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:47.220]   But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form,
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.620]   in capsular pill form.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:51.300]   And there is a practice of starting to ingest
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:55.460]   one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.420]   And then what people will generally do
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.740]   is examine to see whether or not
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:02.580]   that improves their symptoms of indigestion,
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.660]   how it relates to mood, how it relates to wellbeing,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.200]   how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.500]   By changing the acidity,
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.400]   you also change the way that the gut communicates
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.660]   with the brain through the mechanisms
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.740]   we talked about before.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.900]   And there are a growing number of people
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.600]   embracing these practices of taking HCL.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.100]   It's often combined with other things.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:25.000]   It's usually combined with an enzyme.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.580]   And that enzyme is pepsin.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.420]   So most of these supplements
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.260]   come in the form betaine HCL pepsin.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.740]   And while they're not a cure-all,
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.500]   I certainly don't want to suggest that they're a cure-all,
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.140]   many people that have a hard time
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.420]   adjusting the pH of their gut
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.060]   and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota of their gut
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.020]   in the appropriate ways have benefited
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:52.340]   from taking these betaine HCL pepsin tablets
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.900]   or capsules during meals.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.500]   And the general instruction is to start slow,
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.660]   to start with one or two,
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.820]   and then to find a level that you're comfortable with
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.340]   that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.140]   in the stomach that doesn't throw off your digestion.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:06.860]   So it takes a little bit of experimentation.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.460]   Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.900]   before exploring this.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:13.820]   But this has become a very common practice
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.400]   for people with autoimmune disorders
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.700]   and accessing the gut,
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.440]   because it is accessible by taking things,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.880]   has also become a way in which people
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.860]   with various mental conditions
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.400]   are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.600]   Along these lines, I do want to mention
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.180]   that there are studies that show
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.840]   that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.660]   or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.000]   This isn't discussed a lot
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.100]   and the data are a little all over the place,
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.140]   but it is worth thinking about.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.060]   The goal here is not to create
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.040]   as many microbiota as possible.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.200]   What you want is microbiota diversity.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.780]   And I should mention this again
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.380]   in reference to the Sonnenberg study,
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.580]   which was what the high fiber diet does
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.120]   is it increases certain microbiota,
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.440]   but it limits their diversity.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.720]   And what the fermented food diet does,
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.680]   or I should say the diet that includes
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.220]   regular ingestion of fermented foods, a few servings a day,
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:19.160]   is it increases microbiota diversity.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.780]   Now, lack of microbiota diversity
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.760]   has a name in the medical profession.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.560]   It's called dysbiosis and dysbiosis is bad.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.280]   Dysbiosis is what you see
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.880]   when people are spending long periods of time on bed rest
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.120]   or when they've been chronically ill.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.580]   And so here again,
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.120]   we're talking about creating a positive environment
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.960]   in the gut, either by adjusting acidity,
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.880]   maybe you explore the betaine HCL pepsin thing.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.520]   I think if you have healthy digestion,
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.180]   if you feel like you have a good relationship to your gut
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.540]   and it has a good relationship to you,
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.440]   sort of a silly phrase because it is you and you are it,
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.400]   then I don't think there's any means
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.360]   or any need to pursue this.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.120]   But if you don't, that might be one avenue to pursue.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.240]   However, I think primary in all of this
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.200]   is the fermented food findings.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.000]   And it's not just one study, it's many, many findings
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.320]   that now bring us to a place
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.180]   where a huge center of mass of data
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.240]   are pointing us in the direction of saying,
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.480]   ingest fermented foods on a regular basis.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.160]   I should also mention that conditions like sarcopenia,
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.960]   which is the loss of muscle tissue as we age,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.720]   has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.820]   So while today is about interoception,
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.100]   we're talking about sensing,
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.240]   we're also talking about subconscious sensing.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.800]   What are we talking about subconscious sensing?
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.840]   We're talking about subconscious sensing
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.400]   of the milieu of the body.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.700]   When the milieu of the gut and the body is right,
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:44.560]   then the brain and the immune system function very well.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.900]   And so this isn't something where you can sit back and say,
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:50.320]   oh, you know, I feel all those good microbiota in my gut.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.440]   Or, oh no, those are bad microbiota.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.320]   You can't do that.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.000]   Unless you're going to take fecal samples and blood samples
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.080]   and analyze them with the extreme exhaustive nature
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.240]   that the Sonnenberg and other labs do,
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.720]   you're not going to get that kind of information.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.240]   I know there are companies out there that do this
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.320]   and I don't want to knock on any of them,
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.960]   but I do want to emphasize that to do this right,
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.600]   to really analyze which cytokines you're making
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.600]   and which ones you're not,
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.400]   you really need to look at a huge number of them.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.160]   And that requires large-scale proteomic and genomic
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.960]   and inflammatory marker screens.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.240]   It's just not the kind of thing
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.920]   that most commercial enterprises can really provide
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920]   to people in a way that they can interpret.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.040]   Rather, this is a case where you can simply go
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.800]   to the effector, to the thing that can actually
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.880]   move the needle in the right direction for you.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.480]   It's very clear that's fermented foods
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.680]   and that's keeping the stomach slightly more acid
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.020]   than one might think you would want to.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.440]   So let's talk about barfing first.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.720]   Barfing, AKA vomiting,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.220]   is when the contents of your guts run in reverse,
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.360]   meaning when they go up from your stomach,
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.960]   sometimes even up from the intestines,
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.580]   even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes happens,
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.160]   up out the esophagus and mouth
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.320]   and onto whatever surface happens to be in front of you.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.460]   It's a terrible thing, nobody likes to do it,
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.520]   but it's a very interesting aspect to our biology
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.600]   because it reveals a beautiful
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.640]   and absolutely fundamental relationship
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.840]   between our chemistry and our brain.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:25.640]   So your brain is actually locked behind a gate
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.140]   and that gate is not your skull.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:31.200]   That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.520]   So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions,
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.800]   the things I talked about before,
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.760]   that provide a fence so things can't get through
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.840]   and get through and leaky gut,
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.800]   your brain has tight junctions that are very, very tight.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.600]   It's absolutely fundamental that only certain molecules
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.380]   get across the blood-brain barrier and that others don't.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.520]   And the reason for that is that most all,
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.520]   99.9999% of your neurons do not regenerate.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.840]   I don't care what you've read,
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.000]   especially in the news recently
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.900]   about how psychedelics cause neurogenesis
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.640]   because they don't, it's absolutely wrong.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.560]   Psychedelics have effects on brain plasticity,
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.320]   but they have nothing to do with neurogenesis,
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.120]   at least no data support it.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.740]   But because you can't make new neurons,
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.060]   you also can't damage the ones you've got
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.800]   or you shouldn't as much as possible.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.080]   And that's why you have a blood-brain barrier or a BBB.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:30.080]   So the BBB as it's called prevents substances
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.160]   from getting to the brain.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.140]   However, like any fence,
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.440]   it is not always uniform along its length.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.280]   And there are little spots within that fence
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.700]   where chemicals can sneak across to the brain.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.880]   And through a beautiful design,
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.680]   I don't know anything about the design.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.620]   As I always say, I wasn't consulted the design phase,
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.060]   so I'm not talking about any kind of intelligent design
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.320]   or anything, that is not the topic of this podcast.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.920]   This is not a philosophy podcast,
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.920]   nor is it a religion podcast, it's a science podcast.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.460]   But through a beautiful design of some sort,
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.440]   there are little holes in that fence
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.080]   and there are little neurons
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.040]   that sit right behind those holes.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   And those neurons sense what the chemistry of the blood is.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.900]   So I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.680]   that today's discussion about sensing the self
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.480]   would be sensing your own blood, but you do.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.520]   There's a little area of your brain that's little indeed,
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.760]   but is very, very important called area postrema.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.880]   P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.640]   An area postrema is an area of the brainstem
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.780]   that sits right next to another brain area
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.880]   called the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.060]   And when the contents in your bloodstream
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.520]   are of a particular kind,
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.920]   meaning when there are pathogens or it's too acidic,
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.520]   the neurons in area postrema
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.480]   and the neurons in the chemoreceptor trigger zone,
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.660]   the CTZ as it's called,
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:05.620]   trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.740]   that make you barf, okay?
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:12.440]   The feeling that you need to throw up
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.280]   is triggered by these neurons in the brainstem
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.240]   and those neurons in the brainstem are triggered
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.400]   by the presence of certain chemicals.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.920]   And the reason why you don't have any blood brain barrier
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.920]   at that location is because postrema has to be there
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.300]   like a crossing guard,
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.060]   making sure that everything that's coming through the blood
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.580]   is okay and if it even senses just the tiniest bit
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.180]   that things are off, it's going to trigger that reflex.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.280]   Now, the really interesting thing is that the neurons
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.440]   in area postrema respond to the chemistry of the blood,
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.720]   but they also will respond to our consciousness,
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.160]   to things that we think and things that we believe
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.560]   and even particular memories.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.060]   This is why when certain people see vomit
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:56.500]   or see someone else vomit or even somebody else heaving
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.920]   as if they're going to vomit,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.460]   they themselves feel as if they're going to vomit.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.000]   I'm guessing there are probably even a few of you right now
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.840]   that feel like you might vomit.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.520]   You might feel salivation in your throat,
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.520]   which is always a precursor to vomiting.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.540]   Some people, the memory of or the thought of something
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.640]   like blood or vomit or use your imagination
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.480]   can actually trigger the vomit reflex.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.680]   And that's because these neurons in area postrema
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:27.520]   are very sensitive to prior experience of interactions
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.440]   with negative things.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.100]   So, and actually, as I'm saying this,
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.720]   I feel my gut kind of cramping up again.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.100]   I don't vomit very easily, I'm not one of those,
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:39.520]   nor am I somebody who's never vomited.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.680]   And here we are talking about my vomit history,
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.720]   but I think it's appropriate in this context.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.500]   The neurons of area postrema are there basically
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.760]   to keep your whole system safe.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.960]   And thank goodness they are because for instance,
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.560]   some people, unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.400]   that they throw up.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.560]   Have you ever wondered why that is?
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.160]   Well, it's because alcohol fundamentally is a poison.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.600]   I'm not saying for age appropriate folks
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.860]   that ingesting alcohol is bad, this isn't a judgment call,
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:14.160]   but alcohol itself at excessive levels in the bloodstream
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.420]   triggers postrema to cause vomiting.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:22.420]   So this is an example whereby memories, context,
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.540]   but also just the chemistry of our internal state
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.080]   is triggering behaviors that are very hardwired,
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.420]   they're very reflex driven.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:33.720]   And why would it be that some people get more nauseous
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.020]   than others at a given level?
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.060]   Well, they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.080]   Some people have what's called a,
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.560]   we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.220]   Other people, they throw up very easily
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.860]   if they don't feel well, or if they ingest anything
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.400]   that's just a little bit off.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.780]   From a purely adaptive standpoint,
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.540]   it's probably better to vomit up things
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.660]   that aren't good for you rather than to pass through,
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:58.860]   have them pass through your system,
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.580]   especially if those things are contained in lipids.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.960]   For instance, if you ingest something that's in lipid form
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.320]   because cells, literally every cell in your body
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.160]   is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty tissue,
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.920]   I would call the bilayer membrane, it's a little membrane,
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.440]   fat can move through fat very easily.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.580]   And so any bad stuff you ingest
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.460]   can get stuck in your system.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.820]   So let's talk for a second about how to reduce nausea
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.900]   because nausea, that salivation,
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.780]   that feeling that you're going to vomit
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.540]   can be very beneficial in an adaptive circumstance,
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.780]   like you've ingested something bad,
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.100]   but some people experience nausea for other reasons.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.000]   There are good ways to regulate nausea
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.780]   and the ways they regulate nausea are very interesting.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.900]   They actually adjust the activity
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.220]   of these neurons and area postrema,
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.620]   or they change the chemistry of the blood directly.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:52.300]   And many of you have heard this before perhaps,
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.500]   but it turns out that there are good data.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.020]   11 research studies were the ones that I could find,
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.280]   peer-reviewed research studies with no bias,
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.160]   so independent studies showing that ginger
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   can cause a notable reduction in nausea.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.080]   How much ginger?
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.180]   One to three grams.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.100]   What's one to three grams?
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.340]   Well, you have to measure it out on a scale
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.220]   unless you're taking it in pill or capsule form.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.420]   It doesn't seem to matter if you take it
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:14.780]   in pill or capsule form.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.780]   So this thing that you've heard before
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.260]   that ginger can reduce nausea indeed is true.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.500]   Peppermint apparently can also do that.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.340]   And some of you will not be surprised to learn
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:29.000]   that cannabis can reduce nausea.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.580]   Not surprised because cannabis,
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.820]   which has different legality in different places,
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.660]   and I understand that,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.160]   so please take that into consideration,
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   but cannabis, THC, and/or it turns out CBD,
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.420]   can reduce nausea.
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:44.020]   That's been shown in at least one study
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:47.100]   and it probably does that not by changing
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.140]   the chemistry of your blood,
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:51.460]   but by changing the threshold for firing
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.340]   of these neurons in areopostrema.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.300]   And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy,
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.020]   radiation therapy, and others,
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.420]   where people are feeling very nauseous.
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.100]   I'm not recommending people go use cannabis
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.460]   unless they've decided with their selves
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.460]   and their family and their doctor that they should.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.300]   But what's interesting is this thing about CBD,
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.460]   and we'll do a whole episode on THC and CBD.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.680]   CBD doesn't have, or isn't supposed to have,
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.140]   these psychoactive properties that THC does,
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.860]   although CBD can have a mild to major anxiolytic,
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.460]   anxiety reducing effect.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.980]   But it does appear that the data are what,
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.020]   the data support, I should say,
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.620]   the anecdotal reports,
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:33.420]   which are that cannabis can reduce nausea.
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.480]   So to barf less, ginger, peppermint,
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.000]   and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.180]   Now let's talk about fever.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.520]   In previous episodes and in future episodes,
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.380]   we deal with thermal regulation,
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.860]   which is the body's ability to regulate its temperature.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:53.720]   Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.340]   and physical performance.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:58.360]   We're not going to deal with all that right now,
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.020]   but I promise we will going forward.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.620]   Today, I only want to talk about fever
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:06.340]   because fever directly relates to interoception.
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.100]   What do I mean by that?
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.180]   Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.700]   That increase in body temperature is triggered by neurons
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.260]   in the brain.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.220]   And those neurons in the brain are triggered by the presence
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:21.180]   of particular things in the bloodstream.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.060]   What sorts of things?
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:28.200]   Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.640]   When something bad gets in our system,
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.220]   the body doesn't know it's bad.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.500]   It just knows it's foreign and it hasn't seen it before
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.140]   or that it's in the wrong compartment of the body.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.580]   So earlier we were talking about proteins
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.780]   that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:44.580]   You know, you don't want a piece of steak sitting
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:45.820]   in your bicep, that would be bad.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.100]   You would actually develop antibodies.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.980]   You would have a horrible infection,
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.600]   but your body has this intelligence.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.260]   And that intelligence is to know,
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:56.540]   hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region.
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.040]   And then your body or the cells there, I should say,
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:02.820]   will release something that then will travel to the brain
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.420]   and will trigger an increase in body temperature
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.780]   so that your body cooks the bad thing
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:09.060]   or the cause of the bad thing.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.080]   It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.500]   We always think fever is so terrible,
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:16.240]   but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's inside you
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.840]   or that has left the correct compartment inside you
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.700]   and is in the wrong compartment inside you.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:26.380]   So what's beautiful about the fever mechanism
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.940]   is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.280]   Basically, you have a set of neurons
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.980]   that sit near the ventricles.
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:36.820]   Remember, the ventricle is this hole in the tube that is you,
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.080]   the tube that is you.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.060]   You are a tube, a series of tubes,
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.200]   and your brain has a hole down the middle,
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.560]   and it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.760]   At the front, it's called the ventricles.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.600]   They start with what are called the lateral ventricles
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.780]   and the, excuse me,
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.220]   starts with the third in the lateral ventricles,
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:53.660]   and then it goes to the fourth ventricle
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.980]   and then to what's called the central canal.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.580]   But basically, it's just a big space
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.000]   in the middle of your nervous system,
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.900]   the middle of your brain.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.100]   And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.460]   called the third ventricle,
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:06.580]   and it's shaped kind of like a thin oval upright.
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:09.060]   If you're listening to this, just think an eye,
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.140]   just think the shape of an eye,
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.920]   but it's kind of rotated 90 degrees,
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.900]   so it's up and down as opposed to across.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:19.220]   And along that third ventricle,
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.660]   there are little neurons that can sense
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:23.780]   what's in the cerebral spinal fluid
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:24.700]   that fills the ventricle.
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.580]   So in other words,
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.980]   you have neurons that are sensing the chemistry
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.560]   of your cerebral spinal fluid
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.360]   and that have access, therefore,
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.880]   to the chemistry of your body,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.820]   because that cerebral spinal fluid
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.980]   is going up and down the brain and spinal cord,
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.540]   but into that cerebral spinal fluid
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.820]   are signals about the various chemicals within the body.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.900]   So this is not a mechanical system,
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.620]   this is a chemical system.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.620]   Remember, we're talking about mechanical information
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.540]   and chemical information accessing the brain.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:57.400]   So if you have something bad in your system,
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.380]   you've ingested a virus,
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.160]   you breathed in a virus,
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.840]   or you inhaled some bacteria,
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.600]   or you got a cut on your leg
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.600]   and some bacteria are growing there,
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.400]   of course, locally, there will be effects.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.580]   Little things called mast cells, M-A-S-T,
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.440]   little packets of histamine, literally,
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.900]   will go there and explode and cause inflammation,
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.460]   which is actually a good inflammation,
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.620]   and will release little things called macrophages
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.720]   to try to gobble up the infection.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.200]   The other day, I was in Texas,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.960]   there was a mean little mosquitoes in Texas
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.980]   and a lot of them,
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.920]   and I would stand outside and I'd get bitten,
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.760]   I didn't feel a thing,
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.020]   but then later that night,
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.560]   they started swelling up and itching,
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.760]   and then I'd itch them and then they'd swell even more.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.380]   That was because of the release of mast cells,
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:41.700]   of histamines inside those mast cells
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.700]   that were literally causing inflammation of the tissue.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.900]   It wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself,
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:48.380]   it was the immune response to those.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:51.640]   Well, you also have this systemic
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.600]   or body-wide attempt to kill stuff,
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.960]   and that's the fever.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.180]   So the neurons that line these ventricles
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.480]   with cerebral spinal fluid
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.220]   go by a particular name.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.660]   They're called circumventricular organs,
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:07.460]   meaning near, circumventricular, near the ventricles,
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.500]   and you have these organs,
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.100]   and there is a set of neurons,
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.420]   has a really cool name called the OVLT.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.740]   I don't know why I like that, but I just like it.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:17.920]   It's the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.780]   Organum vasculosum lateral terminalis, OVLT,
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:25.380]   are the neurons that respond to toxins
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:27.220]   and bad stuff in your bloodstream,
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.940]   however minor or major,
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:32.840]   and they release things like ILK-1,
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.960]   which are inflammatory cytokines.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.840]   Inflammatory, in this case, is good.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:39.840]   You want inflammation at the site of an infection.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.300]   It's a good thing.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.180]   It's going to help with healing,
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:46.240]   and it's going to change the conditions in your body.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.680]   What's going to happen is
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.860]   when those OVLT neurons are activated
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.500]   because you have something bad in your body
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:54.700]   or something bad is happening in your body,
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.220]   they communicate with an area of the brain
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:58.780]   called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.420]   and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:03.160]   and tries to cook that bad thing.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.420]   Now, it's worth talking about fever for a moment
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:08.900]   and talking about thermal regulation
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.160]   because I think this actually could save some lives.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.940]   So if you are overheated to a point
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:19.520]   where you're getting up past 102 or 103,
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.540]   it's going to vary depending on person to person
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.980]   and certainly age.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.900]   Kids, some people think,
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.940]   can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults,
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.660]   but look, you always want to be cautious
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.060]   about heating up the brain too much
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.380]   because once those neurons are gone, they do not come back
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.340]   and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:39.900]   Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103,
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.080]   certainly 104,
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.460]   you are starting to enter serious danger zone.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.540]   This can happen through exercise in hot environments
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:49.220]   or an inability to escape heat
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.460]   because you don't have covering
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:53.520]   or adequate ventilation or cooling.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.620]   It can also be because of excessive fever
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.940]   for whatever reason.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.100]   A lot of people think the way to deal with this
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.920]   is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.300]   or to cool the torso.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:08.140]   In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller,
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:11.180]   who's at Stanford School of Medicine
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.740]   and he's on the undergraduate side of the campus as well,
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.820]   runs a biology lab.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:17.320]   He's a world expert in thermal regulation.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:20.220]   It's very clear that that's the wrong response
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.700]   to try and cool off the body.
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.740]   If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.580]   on the back of the neck,
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.700]   what you effectively do is cool the blood
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.220]   that's going to the brain.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.780]   And if you do that, then your brain will react
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.420]   by turning up the crank in, so to speak,
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.500]   on the neurons in the preoptic area
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.820]   and will heat you up further
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.700]   and can cook your brain and organs further.
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:47.220]   So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before,
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:50.500]   you want to cool the bottoms of the feet,
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.620]   the palms of the hands, and the upper part of the face.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:55.440]   And I'm not going to go into all the details
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.100]   as to why you want to do that right now,
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:58.780]   but those are the locations you want to cool.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.860]   Now, you can also cool the rest of the body,
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.260]   but it's not okay to just stay under the covers
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:06.340]   and just cool the neck or something like that.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:09.180]   You really want to try and create a systemic
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.120]   or whole body cooling if the goal is to bring fever down.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.060]   But in many cases, fever is adaptive.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:17.680]   And so taking non-steroid and inflammatory drugs
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.720]   like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.280]   if that's recommended, but other times,
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.940]   because it reduces your fever, it's allowing that pathogen,
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.680]   that pyrogen, it's sometimes called.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.920]   A pyrogen is a substance that causes fever.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.520]   Think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.400]   Those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures,
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.840]   and they can't survive at high temperatures.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.840]   So the fever is an adaptive mechanism,
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.700]   and the OVLT and the sensing of your chemistry
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:49.340]   is how the OVLT, organum vasculosum
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.580]   and the lateral terminalis does that.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.220]   So we've talked about sensing lung volume,
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.320]   speed of our heartbeat.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.200]   We talked about sensing the gut volume,
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.520]   the intestinal volume, or the absence of volume.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.520]   We talked about chemistry of the gut and the gut microbiota
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.360]   and autoimmune functions.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.040]   And we've now talked about vomiting,
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.120]   and we've talked about fever.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.120]   Lots of aspects of sensing our internal self.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.540]   Now I want to turn our attention to interoception
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:22.240]   as it relates to feelings,
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.320]   the way that interoception is most commonly described.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.020]   And I want to highlight a term
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:28.260]   that many of you have probably heard,
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.800]   which is the vagus nerve.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.480]   We talked about vagus a little bit earlier,
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.760]   but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding, wandering nerve
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.620]   is involved in everything I've talked about up until now.
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:41.720]   And the reason I saved it till now,
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.120]   rather than mentioning it all along,
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.180]   is to highlight a specific point,
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.460]   which is that whenever we hear about the vagus
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.020]   in popular culture, it's like the vagus calms you down.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.160]   You want to stimulate the vagus
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.560]   by rubbing in front of the ear,
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.940]   and it's a parasympathetic nerve,
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.660]   and it will calm you down, it'll mellow you out.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:59.700]   Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory.
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:02.060]   When you ingest foods with amino acids,
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.260]   sugars, or fatty acids,
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:07.340]   the vagus nerve gets activated
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.820]   and triggers the release of dopamine.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.080]   It makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.680]   or what led to those conditions.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:17.220]   When you feel nauseous, it's rarely calming.
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.100]   When you feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.380]   So you're starting to get the picture
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.940]   that even though the vagus nerve
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.200]   is in the parasympathetic branch
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:27.500]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:28.720]   and if that doesn't mean anything to you
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.960]   'cause you're not an aficionado, don't worry about it,
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.240]   but it's not a calming system.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.500]   It's a communication system, and it's a motor system.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.800]   It communicates brain to body and body to brain,
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.440]   and it changes the function of different organs.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.160]   Now, one thing that's important to highlight
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:50.160]   is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.840]   because of the ways that it shuts down the vagus nerve
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.140]   and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.260]   I want to say that again.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:03.200]   Stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good,
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.840]   poor digestion and just lousy,
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.120]   because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.700]   and the neurons of your gut.
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.900]   So what stress does is it blocks the communication
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.340]   between gut and brain.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.740]   It doesn't mess up your gut.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.740]   It just doesn't let your gut get the signals
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:22.420]   up to your brain, and it also then throws off the chemistry,
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.180]   and then there's a whole cascade of effects.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.460]   If you want to learn more about stress,
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:27.820]   I did a whole episode called Master Stress,
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.160]   or I think maybe it was called Conquer Stress.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.300]   I think it was Master Stress, either one.
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:32.480]   The whole point of that episode
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.840]   is to give you tools and practices
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.260]   to deal with short-term acute stress, moderate-term stress,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:40.820]   and long-term chronic stress through behavioral mechanisms,
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:45.100]   nutrition, supplementation, and many other things as well.
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.060]   It's chock-a-block full of protocols and tools for stress.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:53.900]   The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion,
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:57.020]   and the way it does that is to pool,
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:00.420]   to aggregate the conditions of your gut,
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.980]   the conditions of your heart
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.900]   and the conditions of your breathing,
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.940]   which includes your diaphragm and lungs,
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:10.820]   and takes that kind of as a collection of information
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.420]   and sends it to the brain
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.860]   and controls what we call your emotions.
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:19.040]   Now, that might seem obvious to some people,
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.560]   but to other people, that might seem totally crazy.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.940]   You thought your emotions were
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:25.700]   because the market was down and you had invested,
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.180]   or because something that you thought was going to happen
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.920]   is not going to happen,
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.140]   or because you thought that school was going to open
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:34.140]   and then it's not,
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:36.200]   or maybe you thought it wasn't and it is.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.760]   Whatever it is that bothers you,
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.300]   you think of generally as a purely cognitive event,
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:43.900]   but the brain doesn't really know
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.740]   what to do with that information.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.900]   It doesn't act directly on that information to create moods.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:52.400]   Moods are created through the heart's response
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.380]   to reading that headline,
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:55.820]   to the change in your breathing
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.820]   that's caused by someone that you love telling you
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.460]   that actually they're not interested
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.700]   in spending time with you anymore,
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:02.620]   or that you screwed up,
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.100]   or that they're interested in spending
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.720]   a lot of time with you and you like that, right?
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.460]   Emotions can be good or bad or neutral.
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:13.580]   So this thing that we call interoception, the sense of self,
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:16.260]   I've been building up from very fundamental layers,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:20.340]   gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, autoimmune,
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:21.500]   and you might've been thinking,
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:24.180]   wait, I thought this was going to be about a sense of self,
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.500]   a noticing or a feeling.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.540]   And indeed, all of those things are plugging in
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.100]   like a series of ingredients in a recipe
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:35.300]   that gives rise to your mood and how you feel.
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.540]   And that mood and how you feel
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:41.780]   is shown in one location in your body
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.340]   that other people can see,
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:45.780]   and that's in your facial expressions.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:48.300]   And indeed, there are now beautiful data
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.620]   showing that your face,
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.900]   including the size of your pupils,
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.280]   the tonality of your face,
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.100]   how flushed you are or how pale you are,
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.540]   even the degree to which you are frowning or smiling
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:05.260]   relative to other periods of time,
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:10.260]   that is all an aggregate of, or a reflection rather,
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:12.700]   of your gut, your heart, and your breathing,
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:14.460]   and the chemistry of your body.
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.360]   And so this is why I sort of backed into this conversation
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.260]   about interoception.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:21.800]   I kind of Trojan horse this on you on purpose,
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.340]   which is that when we talk about the vagus and you hear,
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.740]   oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:27.740]   or rubbing on the front of the ear.
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.480]   Sure, that's probably true.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.860]   But another fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut,
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.060]   how fast you're breathing.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:40.020]   Are you inhale-emphasized or exhale-emphasized breathing?
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:44.740]   When we are relaxed, our pupils tend to constrict.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:49.100]   When we are very alert, our pupils tend to be dilated,
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:50.140]   whether or not that alertness
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:53.620]   has to do with being happy or being sad.
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:56.180]   And what's remarkable, and this is where interoception
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:59.980]   really, really takes a leap into the incredible,
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:02.820]   is that there are beautiful studies that show
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:06.100]   that, for instance, when we know somebody pretty well
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:08.740]   and they are going through some sort of experience
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.220]   of any kind, our heart rate actually starts
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.180]   to mimic their heart rate.
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.180]   Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing,
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:18.740]   even if we aren't conscious of their breathing.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.740]   It's not like we see their chest heaving
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:25.580]   and we think, oh my goodness, and then we breathe that way.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.020]   There's a mirroring.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.980]   And no, it's not carried out through mirror neurons.
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:31.120]   Mirror neurons are more of a myth than a reality.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.860]   Sorry to burst people's bubbles,
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:34.620]   but that bubble around mirror neurons
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:38.940]   is definitely made of myths and a topic for another time.
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:41.020]   But we start to mirror.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.220]   Somehow, human beings are able to register
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.300]   the internal state of other beings,
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:47.780]   and I think probably for animals too,
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:51.020]   but certainly for other humans, even at a distance.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.900]   And these studies are many now,
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.540]   and they're really wonderful studies.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:58.240]   And so your sense of your internal landscape
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.300]   is linked to others.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:03.660]   Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.660]   for how you feel and how others feel.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:08.960]   In other words, you can start getting a better readout
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.460]   of your internal state by doing a simple exercise,
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:15.940]   what is really a tool,
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:19.540]   and that is to learn to sense your heartbeats.
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:21.860]   So some people are very good at this.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.300]   Other people are not.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:24.900]   Some people can do this more easily
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:26.740]   when they have all their air exhaled,
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.860]   and some people can do it better
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.580]   when they are holding a breath hold.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.980]   But one thing that's kind of cool
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.000]   about this whole interoceptive capacity
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.460]   is that you can enhance it very, very quickly.
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.460]   You can learn or teach yourself
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.660]   to have heightened levels of interoception
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.720]   in a way that you can't really just give yourself
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.920]   heightened levels of vision by snapping your fingers
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.180]   in one round of one tool or exercise.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.800]   There are things you can do to improve vision.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.360]   That's the topic of a previous episode.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.400]   I encourage you to look it up.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.680]   There are things you can do to improve your hearing
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.160]   and your taste and your smell.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.780]   We talked about all those.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.120]   But within interoception,
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.500]   you can get very good at this very fast,
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.600]   and I think this is one of the reasons
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.360]   why meditation is powerful.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:07.280]   I think there are a lot of reasons
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.320]   why meditation is powerful,
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.200]   but one of the reasons is when you stop
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.660]   taking in exteroceptive information,
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:14.660]   information from the outside world,
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:17.680]   by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say,
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.880]   you start paying attention to your breathing cadence.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.380]   You start directing your mind's attention
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:24.980]   to your heart rate.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:28.240]   And if you can start to perceive your heart beating,
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:31.800]   you actually are very quickly strengthen
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.120]   the vagal connections between the body and the brain.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.900]   And so there's no real practice here.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.600]   There's no breathe this way or do this thing,
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.520]   And some people can get very good at this very fast.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.140]   Most people find that just by doing this
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.840]   for a minute or so every once in a while,
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.540]   they start to tap into this sixth sense.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:59.600]   They start to notice when they don't feel quite right
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.480]   about something or somebody or some situation,
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.680]   or they start to notice when they feel quite right
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.200]   about somebody or something or some situation.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.920]   So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.120]   It used to be called vagal tone,
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.200]   but I think that term doesn't take into account
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.360]   all the other things that are going on with the vagus.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.760]   So I don't really like that term.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.840]   It's more of an interoceptive awareness.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.020]   And again, there are many studies now showing
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:29.140]   that for sake of bettering one's mood overall,
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:31.700]   for sake of moving through a challenging phase in life,
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:35.400]   for sake of just enhancing one's experience of life overall,
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.720]   whether or not it's the taste of foods,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.640]   interactions with other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure,
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.240]   tuning up one's interoceptive awareness is both easy,
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:46.980]   again, by just taking a minute or two
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.200]   and trying to count heartbeats.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.860]   And then this works best, of course,
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.900]   if you have some independent readout of heartbeats
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:55.960]   and you can compare, you can see how accurate you are.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.760]   But even if you don't use a device
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.200]   or have a device to do that, without taking your pulse,
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.760]   using your thumb on your wrist or something
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.140]   or your fingers on your neck,
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.160]   as you typically would for taking your pulse,
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.280]   trying to sit still for a minute or two,
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.280]   every once in a while, maybe once a week,
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:13.700]   maybe twice a week, maybe while you're meditating,
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:14.680]   maybe while breath work,
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.100]   maybe during the breath holds of breath work,
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.020]   you don't really have to do this in any kind of extended way.
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.960]   You can very quickly increase your interoceptive tone.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.140]   And that has a huge and outsized effect
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:28.160]   on the brain-body relationship
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   and your brain's ability to tap into both the subconscious
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.180]   and the conscious aspects of this chemical
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:38.400]   and mechanical signaling that's happening all the time.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.200]   And it can have real and outsized positive effects
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.440]   on your ability to engage with other people
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.880]   and your ability to focus at work.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.360]   And your ability to notice,
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:51.000]   ah, I'm finding myself kind of feeling
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.300]   like I'm losing focus,
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.220]   but really it was my heart rate was just increasing.
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:55.640]   Maybe I just exhale a little bit
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.980]   and bring my heart rate down.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.060]   So what I've effectively tried to do today
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.840]   is to give you a window into this incredible relationship
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.800]   between your viscera and your brain
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.960]   and your brain and your viscera,
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.120]   all these organs of your body.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.480]   And what I hope is that you'll appreciate that it's a system
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:14.660]   that you aren't just a system of tubes.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:16.120]   I said that in sort of ingest.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.060]   I mean, you have a lot of tubes
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:18.360]   and you are a system of tubes,
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.500]   but that system of tubes is linked
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.140]   through the nervous system.
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.000]   And those links work in very specific ways.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.060]   So whether or not you remember about piezos
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:28.920]   and all the GLP-1Rs and all that stuff,
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.240]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.400]   What I encourage you to do is start sort of pushing
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:34.940]   and pulling on the various levers
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.260]   within this beautiful system
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:40.340]   that we call the interoceptive system, this sense of self.

[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:15.480]   During the course of today's episode
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.000]   and on previous episodes, I mentioned supplements.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.800]   I realize supplements aren't for everybody,
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:22.080]   but for those of you that are interested in supplements,
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.380]   it is important that the supplements that you take
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.380]   have a high level of stringency
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.680]   with respect to the amounts of the contents
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.660]   that are listed on the bottle,
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.440]   matching what's actually in the bottle,
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.000]   in the capsules and tablets,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.940]   and that the quality of those ingredients
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:35.800]   be extremely high.
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.680]   For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.720]   because Thorne supplements have the highest levels
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.840]   of stringency for both the content
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.200]   and the amount of content in those bottles and supplements.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.620]   If you want to try Thorne supplements
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:51.120]   and you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.560]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.260]   and you can see all the supplements that I take.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.680]   You can get 20% off any of those.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:02.240]   And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:04.360]   you can get 20% off any of the supplements
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.600]   that Thorne makes.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.520]   In addition, we have a Patreon account.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:10.480]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
