[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Eric writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I've heard many times how we are to forgive ourselves,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   but I can't find a biblical text to back this statement up.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Where are people getting this idea of forgiving ourselves from?"
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Well, I share Eric's perplexity about the language of self-forgiveness.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I've never preached that anybody should forgive themselves.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   At least, I don't remember ever saying it.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And I've never used it as a way of dealing with my own self-hatred or condemnation or whatever that it's supposed to deal with.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And the reason is mainly, I don't think it's in the Bible.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And the reason I don't think it's in the Bible is that I think it would be intrinsically confusing about the nature of forgiveness if it were.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Maybe the reason the Bible doesn't think in these categories of self-forgiveness is that to have forgiveness,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   you need a person who has been wronged and a person who did the wrong.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So, I insult you, you are insulted.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Now, apologies and forgiveness can happen.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I can say to you, a different person, "I'm sorry."
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And you can say to me, a different person, "I forgive you."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But when we talk about forgiving ourselves, who's the one doing the wrong and being wronged?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Ordinarily, when someone talks about forgiving himself, he means forgiving himself for something he did to somebody else.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So, Jack insults me and then apologizes, and I forgive Jack.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Then why would Jack forgive Jack when Jack didn't insult Jack?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   That's how forgiveness works, and that's what I mean when I say it would be intrinsically confusing.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It breaks down the clear categories of what forgiveness really is about.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It starts to muddy the waters of what forgiveness really is—a wronged person forgiving a person who wronged him,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   not a wronging person forgiving a wronging person.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   But those who use this confusing way of talking are really dealing with something real.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   They're trying to get at something, right?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And what is that?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Well, when I search biblically to try to find where's a biblical paradigm to deal with what these folks, I think, are really trying to deal with,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   the closest I can find is 2 Corinthians 7, 8-10.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So Paul has found the Corinthians at fault.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   They've sinned, and he's written a tough letter to call them out on it and to summon their repentance,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and they do repent, and he's clearly forgiven them, that he's not holding it against them.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And here's what he writes, "Even if I made you grieve with my letter," so he stung them with his rebuke,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   "I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it. I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So, in other words, they saw they're wrong.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   They apologized to the appropriate person.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   They received forgiveness.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Then he goes on, "For you felt a godly grief so that you suffered no loss through us.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   For godly grief—remorse, sorrow for something you've done—godly grief produces repentance that leads to salvation without regret,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   whereas worldly grief produces death."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Ponder what Paul means by godly grief and worldly grief,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   the one leading to repentance and life, and the other leading to death.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I think this is very close to what people are dealing with when they speak of the need to forgive themselves.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   They mean they need to move through worldly grief over sin to godly grief over sin and beyond into life and freedom.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And the difference is a grief that leads out of death-giving self-condemnation to life-giving acceptance of God's—and in this case, Paul's—no condemnation.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The biblical way out of death with this so-called self-forgiveness is to humble ourselves and admit we have no right to take the role of judge and pronounce the death sentence on ourselves.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   That's pride to think that we can hear God's verdict of not guilty or our friend's verdict of not guilty—that is, "I forgive you"—and refuse it.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   We refuse it and set ourselves up as the new judge and pronounce a death sentence over ourselves.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The biblical problem with that is not a failure of self-forgiveness. That's not a biblical category.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's an arrogant failure to trust in the free verdict of God. No condemnation.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So my closing word is, let's humble ourselves and step down off the judge's seat and let God be God in his pronouncement of no condemnation.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Amen. That's a great word, Pastor John. Thank you.
