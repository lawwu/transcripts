[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.360]   Today I want to dig into the stages of financial independence.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.600]   I'm going to give you the roadmap to go from completely broke and dependent on others to
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:30.880]   absolute and total financial abundance.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.840]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.680]   This is the show where we talk about wealth. We talk about wealth from every single direction,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   but we have a heavy, heavy focus on financial independence. Today I'm going to give you the
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.960]   roadmap. This is my roadmap. I've come up with this, and I want to get your feedback on it.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.840]   I want to hear if it works for you. Stay tuned.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   As many of you know, I've been working, depending on when you listen to this,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.480]   I've been working hard on getting the new website renovated and out. As I record this,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.920]   today is April 2nd, Thursday, April 2nd, that this show will be going out, 2015.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   The whole process and the project for the last few weeks has been to get the new website going.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.280]   Well, that is and was a major challenge and continues to be. It's certainly not finished,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.120]   but at least it's live. Now I've got the massive task of properly categorizing all the past
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.920]   content while still pushing forward with the new content. That's what's taking up a lot of my time
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.440]   at this point. The biggest challenge of actually getting a new website released is how to organize
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.800]   the content and how to organize the information. Frankly, if you are a regular listener or a
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.720]   long-time listener, you probably very rarely actually go to the website. You probably are
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.520]   listening to me through some sort of simple mobile podcast subscription app, usually on a phone. This
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   may be iTunes, or it might be an Android app, or it might be our own app, which by the way,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.400]   the best way to listen is just use the Radical Personal Finance app. It's free, and it's in every
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.480]   mobile app store. Just search Radical Personal Finance and you can find that.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.280]   So that's how most people listen and interact with the show. In some ways, that works really
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.160]   well, especially if you're starting from the beginning and you're listening from the beginning
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.280]   all the way through the end. That would be a great idea. I'd love it if every listener did that
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   because this show is a cumulative show. I try very hard not to repeat topics that have been
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.400]   covered before. If I'm repeating a topic that has been mentioned, it's because I'm bringing
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.280]   another angle to it or trying to bring something out of it. So this show is intended to be a
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.880]   cumulative project. Certainly, I'm not perfect at that. Sometimes I do repeat myself or repeat a
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.320]   topic, but that's the guiding principle in my mind. So there's not really much of a way for
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.200]   me to easily organize things on a podcast app. Basically, you just scroll through the listing and
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   look at the show titles. If I do a good job with my show title, you'd be interested in one or
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.360]   interested in another. Then hopefully, most of you at some point will go back and start at the
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.760]   beginning and put up with the difficult ones, the ones where I was still learning. If you get a
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.120]   little bit into a show and say, "This is not useful to me," then just skip it and go on.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:39.920]   That's the hope. But then, however, at this stage, this episode is episode about 174. So by the time
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   you get into 174 episodes, it's not realistic to think that new listeners will go and start from
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.960]   the beginning. So I need to provide some way to actually organize these shows and organize this
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.400]   content. I've had an outline in my mind of what I'm doing. I've actually had a physical outline
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.760]   as well. The primary outline that I work from a list of show topics that I have, of ideas that I
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.640]   have, people that I want to talk to, things that I have come across in the last 10 or 15 years that
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   I want to share with you. Then it's just a matter of what's the best way to do it. Sometimes,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.120]   the best way for me to do it is to sit down and do the show myself. Sometimes, I try to find
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   somebody. Sometimes, an audience member suggests someone and I'm able to bring them on. That type
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.560]   of thing works. But I also have been working from the CFP topic areas. One of my goals is to present
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.760]   to you over the course of perhaps 1,000 episodes all of the information that you would need to know
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.280]   to sit for and pass the certified financial planner exam. Then I'm systematically working my
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   way through the formal financial planning topics. So with the new website, I really struggled and
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.000]   tried to figure out how do I organize this information for a new listener? How do I give
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.720]   you a roadmap? The funny thing is there are various aspects and various ways that you need to look at
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.280]   financial information. There are some financial information that a financial planner would need
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   to have that – let's say – let me use an example. Let's say we're talking about something
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.120]   like elder care or long-term care planning. If you're 20 years old and your parents are young
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.720]   and healthy and on their own and not worried about caring for your grandparents or grandparents,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.880]   you're not thinking very much about long-term care planning. So unless you're a financial planner,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.840]   there's little need for you to sit down and become an expert in that area. But a financial planner
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720]   needs to become an expert in that area. So I'm constantly facing this challenge and I went into
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.480]   it with my eyes wide open. But because I've kind of made my show to appeal to in some aspects,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   professional financial advisors and in other aspects, laypeople, heavily interested laypeople
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.120]   who are not financial planners, just interested in their own financial journey, then I constantly
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.080]   have this tension between these two camps because the type of content and teaching that I would do
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.880]   towards a financial advisor is different than somebody who's just looking at their own situation.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.040]   So the major challenge for me with the site was how do I organize the content?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.440]   And then also how do I profile the content in an attractive way so that if somebody lands on the
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.400]   site, then they're able to look at it and say, "Well, how do I navigate through this content?"
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.520]   And I'm going to share briefly with you what I came up with and how I've done that. But I'm
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.080]   going to emphasize to you today and walk you through the stages of financial independence
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   that I've designed. But here is what I came up with. I came up with four primary ways for me
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   to organize the content. And these are primarily ways of thinking about the steps you can take
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.880]   because financial information needs to be processed at different levels. At some levels,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.440]   it's what am I doing now? What am I actually focusing on right now? At other levels,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.600]   it's what's the technical information that I need to know as background information to make a
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.880]   decision? At another level, it's vision. What's my vision of where I'm going and what's my plan
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.120]   for how I'm going to get there? So there are many different levels. And I came up with a total of
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:08.640]   four different paths through the content. And in my daily shows, I bring them out basically every
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.080]   day, mostly – just about every day. I am essentially working my way through these four
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.280]   different areas. And you need to keep these – well, for most of you, it's primarily three areas. For
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.480]   those of you who are interested in financial planning, it's actually four. But you need to
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.560]   keep these things in your mind as frameworks. And so the first topics – and if you'd like to see
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.920]   this, you can go on the website at RadicalPersonalFinance.com, select the dropdown topics,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.880]   and you'll see these dropdown in four different columns. But the first column and the first area
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:49.280]   is actually what you can do and that's your wealth building strategy. That is the five-step
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.600]   wealth building strategy that those of you who are patrons of the show have received access to
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   the presentation that I did, the very concise presentation that I did on these five steps.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.720]   But this is in essence my five-step, ten-word financial plan. These are the only five things
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.920]   that you can do. And it starts with the first three that I have mentioned on the show again
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.200]   and again and again, which is increase income, number one, increase income, number two, decrease
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.880]   expenses, number three, invest wisely, and then number four and five, I haven't mentioned so much
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.600]   on the show, but they are kind of – I call them lenses that you have to overlay on top of the
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.680]   first three steps. Number four is avoid catastrophe and number five is optimize lifestyle. I'll do an
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.960]   entire show on that at some point. But for now, those of you who are patrons of the show,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.080]   you have that information in that little video that was on the confirmation page that I made
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.560]   for you. And if you're not a patron of the show, you should be and you can get that with as little
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.680]   as a buck a month to support the show. So it's a really excellent short little presentation that I
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.520]   did. It's a video presentation with some nice interactive slides. You can find that. Go to
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.240]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and you'll be able to see that yourself after you sign up as a
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.960]   patron. And so that first category, that's actually what you do. So every day, every week, every
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   month, all you're essentially doing is the things that are in that first category. That's all you
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:17.360]   can control. All you can focus on is increasing your income, decreasing your expenses, and investing
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   the difference wisely. From time to time, you need to pick your head up, look at your situation, and
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.280]   look around, make sure that you're doing intelligent risk management planning and avoid catastrophe.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.880]   And then all along the way, you need to constantly be assessing everything that you're doing
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:37.520]   and optimizing it and saying, "How am I increasing my income? How am I decreasing my expenses?
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.560]   Or excuse me, how am I earning my income? Is it in an optimal way for me and my goals?
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.360]   How am I spending my money? Is it being spent in an optimal way for me and my goals?
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.880]   And how am I investing my money and my life? Am I investing it in a way that's ideally suited for me?"
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.000]   And that's optimizing lifestyle. And I can fit everything that we do with financial planning
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.040]   into those five steps and those 10 words. At some point here, I'm going to write a book pretty soon,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:14.640]   and that's my outline. 10 words, 5 steps. But then inside of those 10 words and 5 steps,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.440]   there are nearly infinite choices of ways that you can mix those up in an individualized way.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.960]   The second category is actually where you are. So the first category is what you do,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.560]   what you can control. Number two is where you are in your journey. And I call this the stages
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.800]   of financial independence. That's what I'm going to focus on today in just a moment after my
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.880]   introduction. I'm going to walk through those stages of independence, going from stage zero,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:52.240]   financial dependence, to what I've called stage seven, financial abundance. We'll come back to
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.440]   that in a minute. But that's where you are, and all of us are at different stages of that journey.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:05.760]   The third category that I have on the organizational structure here is what I call
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.560]   traditional life event planning. And this is actually how most people think of financial
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.480]   planning. They think of certain things that you're supposed to do at certain points of life and
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   certain financial decisions that you should make. This is valid. That's why I've included it. This
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:31.680]   one has the most entries, actually. This is valid. But in fact, it's not the most useful because
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   there's generally little or no vision attached to it. And so what happens is people generally
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.400]   wander in and out of these decisions without knowing why they're making them. But it is
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   important to understand the things that are going on at each of these decision points so that you
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   can have an idea of what these categories are. I'm going to go through them, how I've split them out
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   on the site, just because, again, this is an audio program. So I don't want you to feel like you have
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.320]   to pull out your phone and do something unsafe while you're driving down the road. But here are
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.840]   the traditional life events that I have selected to profile. Education in college, buying or leasing
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:16.080]   a car, getting a new job, the loss of a job, marriage, renting an apartment, buying a house,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.640]   having babies, training children, widowhood or widowerhood, divorce, elder care,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:34.000]   pre-retirement, and retirement. And these are not so much stages of life, but rather they are
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.400]   events of life. And they may or may not occur for some or all of us, and they may or may not occur
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   in a certain order for some people. But each of these events has some specific considerations that
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.880]   you need to be aware of. And so over time, there will be a curriculum associated with each of those
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.520]   life events. But those are unique to each person depending on where they are.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.600]   And so part of that is just me organizing, saying these are important things that have
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.000]   major financial ramifications in our life, so I need to make sure that they're well covered in
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   the show topics. But then also part of that is kind of a sales hook on the website to get somebody
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   who shows up there without being familiar with the show to look at it and say, "Oh, I'm interested in
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.280]   elder care," something like that. For most people, they will be most familiar with those first three
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.960]   categories. But the fourth category is actually the professional advisor focus. This is the formal
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:39.440]   financial planning topics. The certified financial planner curriculum, and that's not the only
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   curriculum, but it's just the kind of the most popular in the industry, so that's what I've
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.680]   loosely modeled this off of. But the certified financial planning curriculum is basically
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.760]   divided into five sections, into what they call general principles, income tax planning,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.240]   insurance planning, investment planning, retirement planning, and estate planning.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.320]   Is that five or six? That's six. Excuse me. Six sections. General principles,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.280]   income tax planning, insurance planning, investment planning, retirement planning,
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:12.400]   and estate planning. So in each of those categories, most financial planners or financial advisors
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.080]   will be aware of that outline. I've expanded it a little bit to try to make it a little bit more
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.040]   friendly to a layperson. So here are the formal financial planning topics as I've listed them.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.360]   I've called it general principles, education planning. I've split that out, and that usually
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.480]   comes in under general principles in the formal curriculum. Income tax planning, insurance planning,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.760]   employee benefits planning, that is usually combined with insurance planning in the CFP
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.720]   curriculum. Investment planning, retirement planning. I've included charitable giving here
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.880]   as a separate section because I've got a lot of content that I want to cover with regard to
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   charitable giving over time. That's not just the formal CFP stuff. And estate planning.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.760]   Now, within my outline, actually, I have many more topics that aren't covered on the CFP exam
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   because obviously the CFP is primarily rules and regulations and specifics. It's not so much
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.040]   larger consumer-focused planning ideas. So I've got a lot of stuff I'm going to cover that's not
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.000]   in that outline. If you're interested, by the way, many of you have asked about what are the
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.920]   different types of things, when am I going to cover this, and am I going to cover this other
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.960]   question? I've gone ahead and included the outline that I have in my personal notes on each of the
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.680]   pages under that section. So under the formal financial planning topics, under general principles,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   you can click on that and you can see that I'm going to cover the financial planning process,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.200]   financial statements, cash flow management, credit, debt, and personal financing strategies,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.040]   financial institutions, financial services organizations, consumer protection laws,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.480]   financial planning for special circumstances, behavioral finance, economic concepts, et cetera.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.800]   Now, I am aware, of course, that those – and if you go and look at that, you'll see that that
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.600]   includes the CFP outline for those of you who are financial planners, but it also includes more.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.320]   So that outline in time, what I envision is each of those outline statements plus more that I'll
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.840]   be bringing in over time, each of those outline statements will ultimately lead to a series of
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.680]   shows or a show covering each of those topics. So – and that's primarily the Wednesdays – usually
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.760]   I do them on Wednesdays – the Wednesday formal financial planning shows. For example, yesterday,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.000]   the show on the introduction to life insurance, that actually covers one of the specific CFP
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.360]   outline criteria, which is personal uses for life insurance. That's why I covered that in the way
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.520]   that I did on the show. So that's where we're going in the long term and there'll be many more
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:45.280]   things. There are lots of aspects of things that we talk about. What comes to mind is entrepreneurship.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.760]   When I talk about entrepreneurship, where does that fit? There's no category here on the topic,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.680]   although obviously it does – maybe it will have its own. I tried to simplify these as absolutely
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   as much as I could because I didn't want to be overwhelming, but I did try to make them make
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.720]   sense. Entrepreneurship, what are you doing there with entrepreneurship? Well, you're increasing
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.440]   income and you're optimizing your lifestyle and then also then there are specific aspects of it.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   So at some point, I may create kind of another catch-all or a couple other categories, but for
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.160]   now I've kept it with these specific topics. So these are organizing principles. You can look at
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.920]   your wealth-building strategy and you can think about what do I do next. That's my wealth-building
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.640]   strategy. You can look at your stages of financial independence and you can say, "Where am I in my
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.280]   process?" You can look at the life event planning and if you're facing a forthcoming life event,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.360]   you can go and say, "I just lost my job. What do I need to be doing right now that I just lost my
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.760]   job?" Then you can look at the formal financial planning topics, which is in essence your
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.720]   academic curriculum that you need to be fully competent in our very complex modern financial
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.080]   life. So that's how I've laid it out and I hope that's helpful to you just kind of as an intro.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.120]   All these shows as of right now is in April 2. I've still got to go back through all the
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.680]   archive and I can't outsource because I'm the one who can map this stuff and map all of the
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.080]   shows in here. That's not done yet. So feel free to go by the website and check it out.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.400]   Then in time, that'll be coming. So hopefully that's a good introduction to you guys. I hope
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.640]   you'll benefit from that. Now, I'd like to share with you the stages of financial independence
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   that I have designed. I'm interested in your feedback. This is not something that I've covered
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.400]   on the show in a verbal format before. It's been something that's been in my private notes that
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.160]   I've been thinking about. Essentially, what I've tried and wanted to provide is a roadmap.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.240]   Me personally, I'm very much a roadmap type of person. I like to lay out a plan and say,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.720]   "Okay, here are the steps that I need to follow." The way that I do goal planning, I say, "What's
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.560]   the goal? What are the steps I need to go?" and then just start working my way through the steps.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.960]   I like to have an idea of where I'm going to go. Simple example, sometimes people wonder,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.600]   "Joshua, why do you have so many financial planning designations? Why do you sat down
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.720]   with a notebook one day?" I said, "I know I want to get a bunch of financial planning
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.880]   designations." I sat down and I looked through the entire course catalog that was available.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.160]   I figured out an ideal way to work my way through all of the classes in the most efficient way
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.120]   possible so that there would be maximum overlap between the classes and the different designations
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.160]   because some classes could be used for multiple designations. I laid it out. I just made a list
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.680]   of all the classes and I just started taking them as quickly as I could. I just scheduled the exams.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.040]   I'd usually schedule the exam three months out and get the book, read the book, take the exam,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.440]   schedule the next exam for three months, get the book, read the book, take the exam. You just work
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.720]   your way through and all of a sudden, boom, you've got a bunch of financial planning designations.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.880]   It's not that big of a deal. So roadmaps are useful for me and as I've observed the financial
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.720]   industry in general, they're useful for other people. This is one of those things that gets
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.240]   a guy like me a little bit annoyed because I think, "Well, don't tell me how to get there.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.000]   I shouldn't tell people what to do." But the reality is most people seem to like to be told
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.760]   what to do. Now, whether that's something inherent in who we are as individuals or whether it is
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.560]   something that is conditioned into us by society, I have no idea. But it seems to me from anecdotal
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   observation that most people just simply like to be told, "Here's what you need to do."
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.680]   Most people react well to that. So it doesn't bode well for the style of teaching that
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.360]   I do with Radical Personal Finance where I don't tell you what to do. I just say,
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.200]   "Here's the information you need to make a decision." That's not very popular in popular
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.000]   culture but I can't quite go so far as to adopt what most people do and say, "Well,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.160]   here's how you have to do these things in your life. I think we should change culture."
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.720]   But roadmaps are valuable. The best example, probably the most famous one is I've marveled
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:58.160]   for years at the power both in my life and in observing other people's lives of Dave Ramsey's
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.840]   Seven Baby Steps. For those of you who are unfamiliar, Dave Ramsey is kind of the most
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   admired and definitely the most popular, most followed personal finance guru in our current
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   day at least in the United States. His most famous book is called My Total Money Makeover in which he
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.960]   lays out seven baby steps. The baby steps are modeled on that movie. I don't remember what
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.480]   the name of it was but we're talking about the psychiatrist. You take baby steps instead of big
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.720]   steps. He gives people this very clear prescription and his prescription, let's see if I can remember
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.840]   the baby step one is save $1,000 in the bank which is basically what he calls a starting
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:47.600]   emergency fund. Then baby step two is pay off all your debt. Baby step three is save six months'
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:56.400]   worth of expenses as an emergency fund. Baby step four is save 10 or 15% for retirement. Baby step
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:06.000]   five is save for college. Baby step six is pay off your house early. Baby step seven is get really
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.320]   wealthy and give and invest and something like that. Those baby steps are brilliant for people
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.440]   who are struggling and in debt because it gives them, especially the first three, it gives them a
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.000]   clear game plan to run on. After that, the whole thing kind of falls apart because no one really
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.520]   knows exactly what to do and where does the 15% for retirement come from and how much should I
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.680]   save for my kid's college and should I really pay off my house early and et cetera and what does
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.040]   save and invest and get fabulously rich and give much money away actually mean? What are the
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:44.640]   mechanics of that? So it falls apart over time but it gives people just this amazing action focus.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.680]   So I've thought about that from the perspective of financial independence. If you look at all of
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.080]   the well-developed financial independence curriculum, there's some sort of progression in
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.240]   there. I can't remember – quote them off the top of my head but your money or your life, they give
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.280]   I think it was like eight steps – sorry, it's nine steps of – for your money or your life,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.720]   nine steps to transform your relationship with your life, with your money and achieve
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.680]   financial independence. So there are nine magical steps. Step one, make peace with the past.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.760]   Step two, be in the present and track your life energy. Step three, where is it all going,
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.680]   the monthly tabulation. Step four, three questions that will transform your life.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.040]   Step five, make life energy visible, make your wall chart. Step six, value your life energy,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.360]   minimize spending. Step seven, value your life energy, maximize income. Step eight,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.400]   capital on the crossover point and step nine, managing your finances. So they give nine steps.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.320]   So as human beings, we need some organization to our life is my point with all this.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.720]   The problem is that most of the steps, many of the steps that people talk about are not
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:59.120]   really steps that you can do. So for example, you can't do step four of your money or your life,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.200]   ask three questions that will transform your life. You can't do that step. You can just ask
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:10.960]   three questions. So people try to connect these oftentimes and try to organize financial
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.200]   information so it's actionable. Authors will try to connect things that are where you are versus
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:24.320]   what you do and they try to integrate these things. So in Dave Ramsey's seven baby steps,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.520]   step one, save $1,000 is very different than step two, pay off debt because save $1,000 may be done
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.880]   in three seconds. You might have it already and just allocate that and say, "This is my emergency
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.400]   fund." Maybe it wasn't separated before. But paying off debt might take years,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.520]   become fabulously wealthy and get a bunch of money in one way. Step seven, that's the rest
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.600]   of your life. So when I thought of this, I said, "It should be a difference of what you do and
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.320]   where you are. But where you are is important because it gives you an idea of where you're
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:05.200]   going." So that's why mine, your wealth building strategy, this is what you do. Stage is a financial
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.800]   independent. This is where you are. So it starts with stage zero, which is financial dependence.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.280]   Forgive me if I went too long on that. I'm just trying to give the background to this of how I
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.600]   came up with this. But as I came up with it, here are the ones I've come up with. Stage zero is
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:28.400]   financial dependence. All of us begin from a place of dependence on others. Some of us revert to a
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.360]   place of dependence on others. We all begin as babies. We're dependent on our family, on our
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.400]   parents, on our guardian, on an orphanage. We're dependent on someone else to provide for our
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.320]   needs. So we need to transition from that stage of financial dependence to being on our own.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.640]   It might not just be that we're young. It might be that we've had a setback in life. Perhaps we have
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:02.800]   lost our job and lost our house and moved back in with your parents or maybe had a terrible accident
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.240]   and became disabled for a period of time and you're being cared for by an institution of some
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.920]   kind. My point is it doesn't matter why, just simply that stage zero is financial dependence
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.600]   where we're dependent on other people. So we've got to move from stage zero to stage one, which
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:27.760]   I've called stage one, financial solvency. So the first stage of financial independence is to become
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:35.200]   self-supporting and to be financially solvent. Specifically, that means that you're able to
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:41.440]   support yourself on your own income without the aid of others and that you're current on all of
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:49.120]   your bills. I had to include both of those things. I originally in my mind had this split out into
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.680]   two stages. I had financially self-sustaining, which was on your own basically. Then I had
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.880]   financially solvent, which was current on all your bills and I decided it was too complicated.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:06.560]   It needed to have fewer steps. So I've collapsed them into a single stage, supporting yourself
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.760]   and current on all of your bills. That's financially solvent. Now, going from stage zero
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.880]   to stage one, going from financial dependence to financial solvency might be very simple and
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:25.200]   very easy or it might be massively challenging. For example, if you're just getting your first
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.920]   job and all of a sudden you go from no income to having income and if your expenses are low,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   then it's very simple. You can quickly go from financial dependence to solvency.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:39.120]   Or if let's say that things have been really tough, you've fallen behind on your bills,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   you're starting out, you had a very low income or an unreliable income and you need to – you're
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.000]   behind on your bills and so then to become financially solvent might have a lot of work
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.720]   associated with it. You might need to work really hard. You might need to cut expenses to the bone.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.600]   You might need to renegotiate with all of your creditors and get caught up on your bills,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.520]   renegotiate your debt agreement such that you can actually handle your payments. It doesn't
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:07.200]   matter why you're behind. It just matters that you've got to transition to solvency
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.760]   where you're supporting yourself on your income and your current on all of your bills,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.440]   paying as agreed with all of your creditors. Now, also I should say that
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.120]   this – you can run these things depending on how you run your finances. If you're a family unit,
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.440]   then I just pull this as a family unit. If you're an individual, run it as an individual. However,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.800]   you want to do that, it doesn't really matter. I think these stages can be applied
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:40.080]   regardless of how you organize your finances. So get financially solvent. That's stage one.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:46.720]   Then from financial solvency, we need to move to financial stability and that's stage two.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.960]   Once you are current on all of your bills, you need to build a buffer account.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.720]   I don't care. Call it what you will, an emergency fund, cash reserves or any day
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.640]   fund. It really doesn't matter. The point is that you have money saved,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:12.800]   a little bit of a buffer account. This is an incredibly important stage
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   and this money needs to be money that's easily available to you, both for the bad times and for
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   the good. Things happen. Problems happen. Unexpected problems happen. Cars break. Jobs
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.480]   are lost. Kids break their legs. There are unexpected medical bills and illnesses and
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   disabilities, unexpected pregnancies and all kinds of things. Problems happen and you need
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.920]   to have some cash in your life where you can deal with them. But also, unexpected opportunities
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.600]   happen. You're driving down the road and there's a great deal on a beautiful car if you have cash
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.160]   and you can walk over and hand the guy $100 bills and get yourself a great deal. You're down at the
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.120]   flea market or you're cruising Craigslist and all of a sudden, there's a real steal of a buy if you
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.720]   can move quickly. You need financial stability and you need savings and savings give you financial
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:13.040]   stability. Now, how much savings? I don't know. Frankly, I think that's going to be very different
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.960]   for most people. At this point, I would err on the higher side, higher than most people because
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:26.480]   I look at cash as opportunity. So unlike some financial advisors who say, "Well, just have
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.000]   three months of cash and then put everything in retirement accounts," I really don't like that
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   advice. I like to have a lot of cash because I've seen the power of back to optimizing lifestyle.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   I've seen the power that cash can have on your ability to optimize your lifestyle. If you have
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:49.120]   cash, you can really do some amazing things. You can buy the RV for the summer vacation because you
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.680]   see it on the side of the road at a real steal of a deal. You can own it for two months and then you
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.160]   can flip it and turn around and do more. Well, you can't do that if all your money is locked up in
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:06.720]   your 401(k). But if you have cash where you can buy it, run it, and sell it and maybe your total
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.480]   cost was you lost $500 on taxes and you sold it for what you bought it for, that leads to really
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:20.400]   being able to optimize your lifestyle. So I don't know how much the money should be. I love also
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   Dave Ramsey's $1,000 emergency fund. I think he's proven, if you look at the success that people have
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.480]   had following his program, he's proven that having that just small amount of money can really be a
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:40.160]   good kickstart for so many normal, everyday, median income earners. Saving $1,000 can mean
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.480]   the difference between going deeper into debt and getting out of debt. So for some people,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.280]   it might be $1,000. For others, it might be $10,000. For others, it might be $100,000.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.600]   And I think that should vary depending – for others, it might be more.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:00.640]   It should just simply vary depending on where you are. But my point is you need financial stability
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:06.800]   and that means you need savings. And I think you need to sit down and figure out what is my goal
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.000]   for a target level of savings. If you don't have a goal, I would say go with six months of expenses.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.680]   It's as good of a rule of thumb as any. At some point soon, I'll teach the CFP curriculum. They
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.960]   give either three or six months of expenses depending on whether you are a single individual
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.000]   with a job or whether you're a married couple with dual income versus single income. They always
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.920]   go back and forth between the three and six months. I think six months is as good as anything.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.560]   But if you want to use a different number, use a different number. If you have some savings
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:42.080]   and if you're current on all your bills, then you are now financially stable. You're at stage two.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:51.600]   And you can move from stage two to stage three. Stage three is debt freedom. Now,
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.080]   unfortunately, because of my more nuanced ideas and approaches to debt, I can't be as
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.960]   simple and declarative as get out of debt. You have to get out of debt at stage three.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:09.440]   Not all debt is created equal. It's simply not. So you've got to look at an individual situation.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:15.520]   There are massively different types of debt and you've got to look at what your investment
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.040]   options are as well. But I do think most people should consider getting out of debt
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.520]   early in the process. And the reason is because I think that if you're able to get out of debt,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:34.080]   then you're simply more free. And remember that our long-term goal is financial
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.760]   independence and financial freedom. The ability to simply adjust your life
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.560]   and your lifestyle to whatever your current income is, that is powerful.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.160]   It doesn't really matter why the debt exists. If you don't have any pre-obligated
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:58.320]   income payments, you haven't obligated your future income, which is what a debt is,
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.400]   then you're able to pivot on a dime and change. You're able to leave one job and go to another
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.800]   job in another city that you're starting at a lower pay, but it's really got much bigger potential.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.600]   You're able to leave the mind-numbing corporate job and move to the risky startup. And all you've
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   got to do is just simply transition a couple of things and cut your current spending, but you
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.880]   haven't pre-committed all your income. See, this is the major trap of debt, especially consumer debt,
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:29.760]   not investment debt. The major trap of debt is that you are requiring a future higher income.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.280]   You're a middle management employee doing well, enjoying your corporate life. You pre-commit,
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.480]   you're earning $100,000 a year. You've a couple of car payments, a little bit of student loan
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:47.760]   payments, a mortgage payment, maybe a vacation property, whatever, just normal American lifestyle.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.640]   And then all of a sudden, you get a call from a friend. You're in the computer business. You get
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.840]   a call from a friend and you know this business has massive potential, but your friend is
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.560]   bootstrapping it, can't afford to pay you a lot of money. Well, if you don't have any debt, then you
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.040]   can take that risk because you're not pre-obligated with payments. But if you've got a lot of debt
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.160]   and in order to make the risk, you got to go home and convince your spouse that we're going to sell
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.320]   three cars, we're going to move out of this house, we're going to move, it just doesn't go so well.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:24.000]   And so you're more likely to stay with the theoretically safer option and you might miss
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.880]   out on the big win. You might also miss out on the big loss. You'll have to judge the opportunity.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:35.280]   My point is that freedom is not that hard to buy and it's largely involved with freedom from debt.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.800]   So you got to sit down and look at your debt and create a plan to dump the debt or at least dump
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.120]   the debt that's not getting you closer to financial independence. You've got seven mortgages on 11
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.320]   rental properties, then I think you're well on your way to financial security and financial
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:02.560]   independence even if the debt is not paid off. So to me, this is not a clear saying that you must
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.480]   pay off debt before you get to this other stage. You simply need to consider it and have a plan.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   For the debt, being debt-free is powerful from a lifestyle perspective. It's simple, quick freedom.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.560]   Next stage is stage four, financial security. So we're going from stage three, debt freedom,
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:28.320]   to stage four, financial security. Here how I define financial security is essentially the start
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:35.680]   of independence and freedom. If you are trying to go from zero dollars of investment income
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.200]   to enough dollars of investment income to cover your entire lifestyle,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.680]   that's going to be a big difference. If you're going from zero dollars of savings to
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:53.200]   covering $100,000 a year from savings, that's going to take a long time. So how do you stay
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.400]   motivated? Well, how my mind works is I stay motivated by partitioning off certain levels
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.800]   of expenses and saying, "These are now covered." On Monday, I shared with you episode 171. I shared
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.160]   with you to adjust the scale of your budget numbers for maximum mental impact. I shared with
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.000]   you how I think of my income from radical personal finance. If I have somebody that signs up – let's
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.080]   say I have somebody that signs up for my Patreon account at – well, let's say I have five people
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:30.000]   that sign up at – let's say I have 10 people that sign up at $10 a month. Now all of a sudden,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.640]   I know, "Okay, there are my hosting fees. My monthly hosting fees are covered." So I've bought
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   myself independence from my hosting fees. Or if I have somebody that signs up at $25 a month and I
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.960]   say, "Well, there's my cell phone costs." So I'm financially independent from my cell phone costs.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.360]   So what I'm trying to apply there, I'm not fully financially independent, but at least I have
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.280]   income. I have a paying subscriber who's able to – who's paying me and now I'm decoupling just a
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.440]   little bit. I'm a little bit more independent than I was before. So that's the idea that I was trying
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:07.440]   to bring to this. So these next three stages are all based upon that. So I call stage four as
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.160]   financial security and that is where you are able to cover your basic living expenses from your
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:23.200]   investment income. So you get to define this for yourself. What I suggest is you got your housing
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:29.440]   expenses covered, rent or mortgage payments, your basic utilities, basic food, basic transportation
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:37.120]   and basic insurance. Those are the basic need levels of life essentially. When those are covered
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.920]   by your investment income, you're well on your way with regard to financial independence. You've
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.840]   achieved financial security. Perhaps you would choose to measure that in terms of a minimum
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.880]   number. At least if I had $3,000 a month, I would be secure. It's not what I really want to spend
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.720]   which is $7,000 a month but it's $3,000 a month. Figure out what is the basic level of lifestyle
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.680]   that you're trying to cover that would help you to feel financially secure to know that if you lost
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:11.680]   your job or your primary source of income that you're covered for at least the basics of life.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.160]   That's stage four financial security.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:24.320]   Once you get to financial security, then the next goal is financial independence. So I've defined
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.480]   financial independence is when your current lifestyle expenses can be met with your investment
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.360]   income. Then you're financially independent. So whatever your current lifestyle is, assuming that
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.800]   you're living the lifestyle that is pretty much how you want it to be, when that is covered with
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.240]   your investment income, you're now financially independent. That means that you could
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:54.880]   disconnect yourself from work if you want to. Now, does everybody do it at that stage? My
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.400]   experience has been that no, most people don't. If you're very focused on an early retirement
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:07.280]   financial independence goal, then you probably would but most people don't because most people
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.000]   you know they usually have some things they want to do that's a little bit more than what
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   they're doing right now. That's where you go into stage six financial freedom. So stage five,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.720]   we've gone from stage four financial security with basic living expenses covered by investment
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.160]   income into stage five which is financial independence which means your current expenses,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:33.440]   needs and wants are covered by investment income. We move into stage six which is financial freedom.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:42.000]   Financial freedom means that all of your lifestyle goals are able to be met by your investment
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:51.200]   income. So if you say, "I could get by on this but I'd really love to have a nicer lifestyle in this
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.000]   area." For some people, it's, "I'd like to travel a little bit more luxuriously. I'd like to have
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.440]   two boats or a boat or an RV. I don't want to choose between this house and the other house.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.760]   I want to own both houses." Whatever your ideal lifestyle goals are, sit down and write them down
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.000]   and figure out how to meet them. Once you can meet those ideal lifestyle goals from your investment
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:22.160]   income, you now have financial freedom. The key is that it's your list of the things that you
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:29.200]   actually care about, not my list, your list. When your list is covered by your investment income
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.280]   and by your financial plan, you are now fully financially free.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:44.960]   Which leads us next into stage seven which is financial abundance. I've added this stage because
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.560]   this is a stage that many people don't think about. It's the most challenging stage of all in
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:58.320]   my opinion but it's not a bad challenge. It's a different challenge. See, going from financial
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.640]   dependence to financial solvency can be a major challenge for some people.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.920]   But the hardest challenge of all is when you have more money than you need
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.400]   to meet any goal that you have and you have to figure out, "What do I do with it?"
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:18.000]   If you've never been there or if you've never interacted with people who are there,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.040]   perhaps you don't believe me. Most people say, "Oh, that's a challenge I'd like to have." It's
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.880]   a challenge you will have probably. If you do the stages and work your way through it,
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.000]   it's a challenge you will have. Then you'll look back and say, "You know what? That was
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   really challenging." Because now you have to decide how to responsibly manage the surplus.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.960]   You've got more money and more wealth than you're ever going to need to fund your own
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.840]   lifestyle expenses and there's a margin of safety built in. But now, what do you do with the rest of
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   it? How do you allocate it properly? How do you make sure that it accomplishes something good and
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:02.080]   not something evil? Who's going to control it? Who's going to control it when you can no longer
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:11.200]   control it? It's a major challenge, but it can be an enjoyable one. That's why I've included it here
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.920]   is stage seven, financial abundance. There's a different set of planning and ideas and
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.200]   major different set of thought process that you have to achieve. You will probably go from,
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.280]   in stage four, five and six, you're focusing on what are the investment returns and what's the
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.720]   best investment plan for me to cover my lifestyle goals and my lifestyle needs and my income needs.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.600]   Then you'll transition to saying, "How can I invest this money for impact?" Or if I've invested
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:47.120]   it purely for income, "How can I invest this income for impact?" Those are my ideas. Those
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.640]   are my stages of financial independence that I've come up with. I'm interested in your feedback.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.800]   The feedback that I got on this previously was that it's too many, too complicated.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:03.120]   Well, I didn't want it to be so big. I could collapse some of these, but the problem is if
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.760]   you collapse them, you lose out on the ability to measure where you are. I think, for example,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:16.160]   for me, I'm celebrating $2,000 a month of income from radical personal finance. Right now,
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:24.000]   with the Patreon page, we've got 114 patrons and $1,191.50 a month. I'm celebrating that number.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.840]   It's not the $6,000 number I need in order to turn away advertising, but it's a good start.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:37.600]   I've achieved a degree of financial security with that. I've achieved a degree of financial
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.800]   independence. I want to measure that and celebrate that. It's not financial freedom. It's not
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:48.480]   financial abundance. It's nowhere near what I need to meet my financial goals, but it's worth
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:55.920]   celebrating. That's the point that I'm trying to get across. I really don't want to put these down
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.520]   anymore. I've already gotten rid of a few stages that I thought of that just weren't really
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:07.280]   tangible. Here's what I would like to leave you with. First, just quickly recount them in order
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.040]   so you can think about them. I'm going to leave you with an action step. Stage zero, financial
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:17.200]   dependence, where you're dependent on others and you need to transition to being dependent on
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.680]   yourself, to be self-supporting. You're going to go from stage zero, financial dependence,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:27.280]   to stage one, financial solvency. Solvency means you're able to support yourself on your own income
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.040]   without the aid of others and that you're current on all of your bills and obligations.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:39.440]   Moving from stage one, financial solvency, to stage two, financial stability, requires that
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:46.960]   you set aside some cash reserves, money that's available for unexpected problems and unexpected
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:54.480]   opportunities. To transition to stage three, debt freedom, you need to sit down and make a plan
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:02.720]   and say, "What's my plan for paying off debt? Should I go ahead and eliminate my student loans
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:10.000]   or should I not? Should I pay off my mortgage or should I not?" That's debt freedom, make a plan.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.080]   Sometimes the answer is, "I need to clear all these debts," because clearing all the debts
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:22.160]   leaves you free to go and do something different. Sometimes it means, "No, I'm comfortable with
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.040]   these debts. They're all on favorable terms and they're not a factor in my life and so therefore
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.240]   I'm going to allocate my money into a different direction." Then we need to go from stage three,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:39.680]   debt freedom, to stage four, financial security. That's where your basic living expenses are
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.520]   covered by your investment income. Moving to stage five, financial independence,
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.600]   your current lifestyle expenses are covered with investment income.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:56.400]   Moving to stage six, financial freedom, all of your lifestyle goals that you have set for yourself
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:02.880]   are covered with investment income. Once your list is funded, you're financially free and you
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.280]   move into stage seven, financial abundance, which is where hopefully you'll be for the rest of your
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   life. Here's my action step for you. You'll notice that this is primarily a mental construct and I
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   haven't really defined numbers behind these things. That's intentional because you've got to decide
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:26.640]   this for yourself. My goals are not your goals. Your goals are not my goals. For me to tell you,
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.160]   "You have to save this percentage of your income," or, "You have to have this certain goal,"
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.120]   that's a foolish thing to say. It's different for all of us.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:40.400]   I don't particularly value Lamborghinis and yachts and a condo in Miami and a condo in New York and a
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:49.920]   condo in Paris. I don't value those things, but it doesn't mean that you don't. The things that I
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.720]   value, you might not. The key is to define them for yourself. Here's my action steps for you today.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.600]   Figure out where you are on these stages and figure out what it would mean to you to go from
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:08.560]   the stage where you are to the next stage. Are you dependent? If so, what would it take for you to
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:15.280]   become solvent? Are you solvent? If so, what is your number for when you will declare yourself
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:25.120]   stable? Is it six months of cash or is it two years of expenses? Is it $5,000? $1,000? Because
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:32.240]   you're getting started? $5,000? $50,000 or $100,000? What would it take for you to be free from debt
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.640]   and should you be focusing on that first? What is financial security defined as for you?
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.760]   What is financial independence defined as? What is financial freedom? What are all those stretch
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.520]   lifestyle goals that you may or may not do but you think you'd probably like to do?
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.560]   Then ultimately, what is financial abundance and what would you like to do? That's a show for
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:00.960]   another day, but the reality is if you can skip mentally right to stage seven, I think it'll
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:07.680]   transform the rest of your life. If you can skip right to the point of saying, "How can I invest
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:14.080]   for impact?" That goes back to what you can do with optimizing lifestyle. It can transform things,
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:20.080]   but that's a show for another day. Those are my ideas. Those are my stages of financial
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.760]   independence modeled in some ways off of other people's things but largely just due to me sitting
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.480]   down and trying to think through it as I can't really copyright an idea in this type of space
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.800]   because in many ways, these things are self-evident, but I think they're the most useful to me.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.200]   If you'd like to look at them, I've got some pretty cool little icons chosen for them. I like
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.880]   the icons that I picked. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com and click on Topics and just
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.640]   click on the Stages of Financial Independence and figure out where you are. I hope they're
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.800]   useful for you. I hope they can be a useful mental organizing model for you. Really, that's primarily
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:03.120]   all of what financial planning is and what these financial topics are. It's mental. A financial
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:09.520]   plan is a mental thing. It's a plan. It's not all it is. Yeah, it's got fancy paper and fancy
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.600]   graphs and all that stuff. That's just all salesmanship, which is valuable, but the most
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.640]   valuable thing is you knowing where you are, having a vision, having a plan, having a goal.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.520]   Yes, these are mental things and they're different for each one. That's where there could be problems
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:29.040]   with one stage versus another, but it's just a mental construct, but it's a useful mental
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:35.600]   construct because it keeps you focused. You know where you are in your journey. Define them for
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:42.160]   yourself so that you can know when you have enough. The key is to know what's enough for you.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.720]   It's pointless to chase after more, more, more, more, more. Unfortunately, especially in the
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.360]   U.S. American context, that's basically what we do is just constantly chase after more, more, more,
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:58.080]   more. Get off that treadmill and define the plan for yourself. Define what each of these stages
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   means. Define what enough is. Remember, it's your plan. You could change it any time. If you reach
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.320]   a certain stage and realize, "You know what? It's not enough. I need to change something,"
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.840]   no problem at all. Recognize that you can't do anything. You can't do any of these stages.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:19.920]   You can only increase your income, decrease your expenses, invest wisely, avoid catastrophe,
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.560]   and optimize your lifestyle. That's what you can actually do. Focus on what you can do.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.680]   Learn what you need to learn from the life event planning or from just the comprehensive financial
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.480]   planning curriculum. Understand where you are, but apply it to your life with what you can do.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:40.240]   That's it. That's all I got for you today. If this has been helpful for you, I'd be thrilled
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.440]   if you would become a patron of the show. If you're not already, to those of you who are,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.080]   thank you. I don't say that enough. Thank you. I am honored and thrilled that so many of you have
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.640]   chosen to support the show financially and that you're making this crazy crowdfunding thing work.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.240]   We're on our way. The first goal is $2,000 a month. Once we get there, we're currently,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.880]   as I said, at $1,191. Once we get there, I got a new intro that I will commission for you.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:06.080]   And then we're on our way to $6,000 per month to keep the show ad-free by June 1. If you can help
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.560]   get there, I'd be thrilled. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. Thank you.

[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:38.800]   education, and financial enlightenment, but your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:45.680]   actionable advice without knowing anything about you. Please, develop a team of professional
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:53.920]   advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy, and consult them because they
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:54:01.280]   are the ones who can understand your specific needs, your specific goals, and provide specific
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:07.600]   answers to your questions. I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show,
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.640]   but I'm one person and I make mistakes. If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.440]   please help me by coming to the show page and commenting so we can all learn together.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.240]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
