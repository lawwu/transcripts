[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   In the last third of the book of Proverbs,
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.400]   the theme of the quarrelsome wife is brought up five times.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.400]   Proverbs 19, 13, 21, 9, 21, 19, 25, 24, and 27, 15.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.360]   And those references raise the question,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.480]   is a husband encouraged to separate himself
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.160]   from such a wife?
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.840]   This is the question today, not from a man,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.920]   but from a woman, a listener named Sarah.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040]   Hello, Pastor John, I enjoy listening to your sermons
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.820]   and the podcast, The Holy Spirit Works Through You
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.460]   in mighty ways to teach the word.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.720]   My question is regarding verses in Proverbs
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.960]   to husbands about their wives,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.880]   specifically Proverbs 21, 9.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.960]   Better to live on a corner of the roof
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.120]   than share a house with a quarrelsome wife
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   and Proverbs 21, 19.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.160]   Better to live in a desert
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.680]   than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.480]   In the verses and specifically in Proverbs,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.900]   when it's talking about the quarrelsome wife,
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.860]   I get the impression that the man should not stay
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.060]   with a wife of this character,
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.400]   or at least it is not good to be with a wife
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.480]   who is quarrelsome.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.760]   Is this a warning to men in being wise
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.320]   and selecting a wife, or is this for women,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.800]   a warning to wise and future wives
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.340]   to root their hearts in God's wisdom
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.180]   so we don't become quarrelsome?
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.160]   And how does this verse apply if a wife does,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.120]   in fact, become quarrelsome later in the marriage?
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.640]   I know God's will is for a man and a woman
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.960]   to stay together for life,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.820]   but can you bring clarity on the meaning and wisdom
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.920]   that should be pulled from these verses
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.380]   that seem to suggest separation?
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   If a man reads Proverbs 21, nine, and 19,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   and I'll read them again,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.080]   it is better to live in a corner of the housetop
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.560]   than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000]   It is better to live in a desert land
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.860]   than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.760]   If a man reads those and concludes in his heart
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   that divorce and remarriage are being commended here,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   we know that he is in the power of a hardened heart,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.640]   which God disapproves of.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   And we know it because that's what Jesus said.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.720]   They said Moses allowed a man
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.120]   to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.480]   like for being a quarrelsome wife.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   That's what they said to Jesus.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.600]   Moses let a man have a certificate of divorce
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.240]   and send a quarrelsome wife away.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.360]   Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.320]   he wrote you this commandment.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   But from the beginning of creation,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.640]   God made the male and female,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.120]   and therefore a man shall leave his father and mother
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   and hold fast to his quarrelsome wife."
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   There are pointers in Proverbs
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   that leaving this woman for another
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.960]   is not what God approves.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.200]   For example, Proverbs 2:16,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   "You will be delivered from the forbidden woman
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.000]   from the adulteress with her smooth words,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.840]   who forsakes the companion of her youth
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.100]   and forgets the covenant of her God."
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.560]   Now, this cuts both ways for the man and the woman
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   because a covenant obliges both partners in the covenant.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   Covenant-keeping in marriage is obliged
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.360]   by covenant-keeping with God.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.760]   So it goes both ways in marriage
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.520]   because it's rooted in covenant with God.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.360]   For God's people,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.460]   human covenants are rooted in the divine covenant.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.200]   The man with a quarrelsome wife is not free to abandon her.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.160]   He's made a covenant with her.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.120]   So what do these verses mean?
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.400]   I mean, that's what she wants to know.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.820]   What effect should they have on us when we read them?
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.660]   And I'm gonna,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.040]   I think I've got three or four things to mention.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.600]   One, the first implication is for young men
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.360]   who are not married.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.640]   Don't marry a quarrelsome woman.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880]   Live in the desert if you have to.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.280]   Live in a tiny room on your roof with your parents
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.440]   if you have to before you do that.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.520]   And the reason I say this,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.320]   the reason I say the first implication
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.640]   is for young unmarried men
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.200]   is because when you start reading the book of Proverbs,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.840]   you get the impression this book
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   is a summation of the teaching of fathers and mothers
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.740]   that they taught to their sons while growing up.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.580]   That's the impression you get
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.760]   when you read chapters one and two.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.000]   Twice at least, the men referred to as the audience here
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.800]   are called young men and may not yet be married.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.240]   Proverbs 7, 7, Proverbs 20, 29.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   So beware, young men.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.040]   He who finds a wife finds a good thing, so wait for her.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.240]   That's the first implication.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.560]   Number two, a woman who listens in
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.600]   to the counsel of these verses,
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.200]   and I think it's assumed that over time
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.620]   women are gonna hear the book of Proverbs.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.800]   A woman who listens in to the counsel of these verses
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   will take them to heart and seek not to be a quarrelsome
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.840]   or contentious wife.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.800]   And of course, she will take the hint
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.280]   that she too might want to be content
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.520]   to live on the roof or in the desert
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.040]   than to marry a quarrelsome husband.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.980]   So it cuts both ways.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.100]   It's a lesson, don't marry quarrelsome people.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.800]   And if you're married, women,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.360]   do your best not to be quarrelsome and contentious.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.160]   Number three, if the Proverbs teach
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.360]   that a prudent wife is from the Lord,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   a gift from the Lord, then God is able to make
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.520]   out of a quarrelsome wife a helpful and prudent wife.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.200]   So if he gives the gift, if he sovereignly gives the gift,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.240]   he can give it before marriage
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.920]   and he can give it after marriage by changing the wife.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.520]   And that's what the Proverbs teach.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.860]   House and wealth are inherited from fathers,
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.560]   but a prudent wife is from the Lord, Proverbs 19.14.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   He can cause you to marry such a woman
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.900]   or he can create such a woman after you're married.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.340]   That's the third implication.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.880]   Number four, the Proverbs do not teach
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.760]   that we should repay evil for evil
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.680]   or quarrelsomeness with quarrelsomeness
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.700]   or abandonment with quarrelsomeness.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.140]   What does it teach?
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.780]   It teaches do not rejoice when your enemy falls
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.700]   and do not be glad in your heart when he stumbles,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.080]   Proverbs 24.17.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.500]   If your enemy's hungry, give him bread to eat.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.960]   If he's thirsty, give him water to drink,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.800]   Proverbs 25.21.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   So the wife, of course, should not be seen as an enemy,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.880]   but if her quarrelsomeness
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.640]   constantly puts her in that category,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   she's gonna act like an enemy, at least a verbal enemy.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.000]   Here's how to treat her,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   namely better than she deserves, not worse than she deserves.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.600]   I mean, love your neighbor as you love yourself,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.960]   especially the closest neighbor,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.240]   doesn't show up first in the New Testament.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.800]   It shows up first in Leviticus 19.18,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.940]   which is long before Proverbs.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.440]   And it is more than affirmed in Proverbs 24.17
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.740]   and Proverbs 25.21 about loving the enemy.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.240]   So when Proverbs says it is better
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.560]   to live in a corner of the housetop
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.840]   than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.560]   it means that this better, this greater ease,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.320]   greater comfort, greater peace of the housetop
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.240]   over going downstairs and loving this woman is true.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.280]   It's true, it is easier.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.400]   It's more comfortable, it's more peaceful
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   to just go up on the roof and get away
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.000]   from this nagging and quarreling and contention, it's true.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.160]   It's better in many ways,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   but it's not to be chosen over the path of love.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.540]   There's a covenant and there's a command.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.080]   Love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for that wise counsel.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.160]   And for everything you need to know about this podcast,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.800]   go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.880]   Well, Romans 1, verses 18 to 32
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.700]   is one of the most striking texts in the Bible
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.520]   where the Apostle Paul recasts the fallout of idolatry
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   into categories of sexual sin,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.600]   of a deepening entrapment to sexual sin
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.740]   and specifically homosexual practice.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.420]   The text raises questions about whether or not
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.180]   these idolaters manifested in the practices of homosexuality
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.260]   are in a process of divine heart hardening
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.860]   that can be escaped.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.180]   Can it be escaped?
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.260]   That's the question on Monday.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.020]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.300]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.500]   We'll see you next time.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.660]   (upbeat music)
