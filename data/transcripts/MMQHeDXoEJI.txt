[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   We say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. But how
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   does that relate to suffering and the pain of this life? With the opening of
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.040]   the new 9/11 Museum in Manhattan, which opened back in May, we're once again
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.360]   reminded of the permanent pain of September 11th, 2001. So can the gospel
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.880]   really offer joy to us in the uncertain times of a post 9/11 world? This was the
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.240]   question at hand in 2005 on the fourth anniversary of 9/11, which happened to
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.320]   land on a Sunday. Pastor John took up this question in the pulpit at Bethlehem
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.040]   Baptist Church, and here's a clip of what he said. One of the truths that we
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.680]   embrace with trembling joy at Bethlehem is the truth of God's supremacy in all
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.320]   things. The mission of this church is we exist to spread a passion for the
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.880]   supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.440]   And when we say that, we do not mean except in calamities, or except in war,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.840]   or except when Al-Qaeda blows up a building or train, or except when cancer
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.480]   takes a mom or a child is born with profound disabilities. There are no
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.080]   except clauses in our mission statement. We did not formulate this mission
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.280]   statement in 1995 in a rosy world and then get surprised by the reality of
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.160]   suffering. Oops, we forgot. We didn't formulate this statement of mission for
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.840]   this church with our head in the sand as though we didn't know people in this
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.680]   church die and agonize with suffering. We have seen many people die in 25 years,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.920]   some with sweet peacefulness and other in terrible suffering. We exist to spread
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   a passion for the supremacy of God in all things, all things with a capital A,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.880]   through Jesus Christ all the time, no exceptions. None of us who has lived a
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.080]   few decades, and I'm moving towards six, none of us who have lived a few decades
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.760]   has embraced this mission without trembling. None of us has lived this
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.200]   mission for any length of time without tears. We have said it dozens and dozens
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.960]   of times and we will say it till our last breath, that the joy we pursue and
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.560]   the joy we embrace in Jesus Christ is always in this world interwoven with
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:29.840]   sorrow. There is no unadulterated joy on planet Earth while history lasts. None for
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   those who care about other people. The Bible describes the servants of the Lord
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:46.680]   like this, "We are sorrowful yet always rejoicing." 2nd Corinthians 6 10.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:56.960]   Sorrowful yet always rejoicing. How in the world can that be? It can be because
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.480]   Christ is supreme over all things forever and suffering and death remain
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:16.400]   for a while. Therefore, life is not simple. There is pleasure and there is pain. There
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.560]   is sweetness and there is bitter suffering. There is joy and there is
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.320]   misery. There is life and health and there is pain and disease and death.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.400]   Therefore, emotions are not simple. For those who love others and don't just
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   care about maximizing their own comforts in a private little sphere, this
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.360]   complexity will always mean we rejoice with those who rejoice, we weep with
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.240]   those who weep, and we always know somebody rejoicing and we always know
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.840]   somebody weeping. Therefore, we will in love discover the mystery of sorrowful
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.640]   yet always rejoicing and rejoicing yet always sorrowful. If you haven't found
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.440]   that mystery, you haven't lived long yet, or you don't love people, or you're not a
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.000]   Christian. Sorrowful yet always rejoicing is the banner that flies over this
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.960]   church. That was an excerpt from the sermon "Where is God? The Supremacy of
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.920]   Christ in an Age of Terror," preached at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.880]   on September 11th, 2005. You can find the full sermon and hundreds of other
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.840]   sermons and thousands of other resources from John Piper all free of charge at

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   sure to check out Ask Pastor John episode number 117. We titled it "The Joy
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.520]   of Calvinism and the Fight for Joy." It's worth your time and it's related to this
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.920]   episode. Well, should women become ministers? Of course. Pastor John will
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.880]   explain why tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast. We'll see you then.
