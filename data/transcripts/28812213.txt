[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.640]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.120]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.040]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.380]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.280]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.400]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.340]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.200]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.120]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.120]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.620]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.720]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.080]   Well, listeners, I can hardly believe that it's advent.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   I feel like this year has been a rushing rollercoaster
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.280]   and I am shocked to look up and discover
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.740]   that this is our first week of advent.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.280]   I have a suggestion for your family,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.980]   for all of our families this Christmas.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.040]   What if we intentionally spent time together
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   doing the simplest things?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.760]   What if we practiced simple habits
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.120]   designed to draw us to one another
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.300]   and to start meaningful conversations
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.120]   and to provoke us to deeper thinking
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.560]   and to encourage us toward true worship?
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   What if, what if in this season of busy
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   we celebrated Christmas by praying together,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   playing together, reading together,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   exploring together and serving together.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.400]   This advent season, the everyday educator
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   wants to practice these scribblers habits along with you.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.200]   And we're going to talk with others
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.400]   who want to try this plan too.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   So you can listen in every Tuesday of the advent season
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.680]   to ponder the next habit.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   And today we are going to think about praying together
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.320]   and I have my friend Karen Carpenter
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.780]   along for this ride and this conversation.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.320]   Karen, thanks for joining me.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.040]   - Oh, it's my pleasure.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   - I am excited.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.380]   Now I personally love Christmas.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.520]   Are you a Christmas lover, Karen?
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.080]   - I love Christmas and my family has always loved Christmas
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   and we get into almost everything.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   We love the decorating and the baking and the caroling.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.720]   We love Christmas cookies.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.100]   We love Christmas parties.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   I like Christmas movies and we can get really busy.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.280]   My husband's a pastor.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.800]   And so Christmas season is busy season at our house
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.900]   and has been for years and years and years.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.640]   And there are years when I think it's just too much.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.660]   Too much of a good thing is not too good.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.320]   It's just too much.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.500]   It's still too much.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   And I was pondering ways for our family
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.060]   to enjoy the deep celebration of the season
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.800]   without participating in all the frenzy.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   And so I want us to look at how we can celebrate Christmas
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.460]   this year in simpler ways.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.960]   And so Karen, thank you for coming on
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.780]   and helping me think about praying together.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.740]   I wanna ask you, I know that you homeschooled your children
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.740]   and you don't have any that you're currently homeschooling.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.100]   You don't have any kids at home now, right?
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.380]   - Correct.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.660]   - But I wanna ask you about this.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.400]   Did your family have a regular prayer time together,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.940]   apart from saying blessing at mealtime
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940]   and prayers at bedtime?
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.060]   Did your family have a regular prayer time otherwise?
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.460]   - I think that we generally use
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.740]   what is now called morning time.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.900]   We did not have that phrase when I was homeschooling,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.260]   but that was generally when we would
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.340]   either be reading a book together with spiritual content
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.360]   or we'd be reading through parts of the Bible
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.700]   or sometimes we'd even be using the hymnal
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.120]   and that would be a time when we would pray together.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.420]   So did you intentionally pray?
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.980]   I'm thinking, we did the same thing.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.480]   Yeah, you and I homeschooled
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.380]   before the morning basket time was a thing.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.220]   But we started our day together, reading scripture together,
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.220]   memorizing scripture together, lots of years,
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.820]   and like you said, reading a book or a hymn
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.740]   and thinking about the Lord.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.260]   But then we had a specific prayer time,
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.560]   and even when I was a challenge director,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.820]   we tended to do this.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.120]   We had a morning prayer time where I asked my children,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.020]   my own children and my challenged children,
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.580]   who they wanted to lift to the throne together.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.500]   So we had a time that we prayed for other people.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.340]   Did you guys have a season of prayer for things,
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.300]   people that were outside your family?
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.580]   - Yes, and as a challenge director, we also did that.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.300]   We had, that was first thing in the morning.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.900]   We would spend some time in prayer.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.340]   And really, I felt like part of my job
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.620]   as their challenge director was to train them
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.180]   to think about how prayer works a little bit.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.300]   Sometimes prayer time kind of became an announcement time.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.140]   I saw a rag, or this is happening or whatever.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.500]   And so training them to say, okay,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.280]   how would you like to pray about that?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.480]   What do you want to bring to the Lord
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.780]   about that thing that you just told me?
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.700]   To just kind of train them to think
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.780]   about things a little differently.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.680]   - That's lovely.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.940]   That's lovely, Karen, what a gift.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.260]   What a gift of training.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.560]   And I think, I'm sure that your students
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   were blessed by that habit that you inculcated
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   in them of thinking about how am I asking God
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.000]   to be involved in this situation or in this problem?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.780]   That's really good.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.200]   Did you, in your challenge group
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.560]   or in your home prayer time with your own kids,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.160]   did you, was it the same every day or every season?
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   Or did you ever do anything differently during Advent?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.780]   Did you have special prayers
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.340]   that y'all prayed during Advent?
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.100]   - Well, with my own kids at home,
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.620]   we used the Jesse tree for several years.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.020]   - Oh, yes!
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.300]   - And so what I wanted the prayers to be
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.220]   coming right out of Thanksgiving season,
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.480]   'cause the season of Advent starts right
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.140]   on the tail of Thanksgiving.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.120]   So we had just been thinking through
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.460]   what to be thankful for.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.260]   And in general, a lot of the things
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.980]   that we were thankful for during the Thanksgiving season
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.860]   were blessings that we had received,
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.640]   sometimes materially, sometimes relationally.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.920]   But what we did with our Jesse tree
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.240]   was we would look at each of the ornaments,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.180]   talk about the root that sprung from Jesse's tree
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.340]   and that it was for different people.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.500]   It was for the Gentiles.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.300]   And how can that make us thankful?
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.380]   And why is that so important to you and me today?
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.260]   And what would be different if that weren't true?
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.780]   And then we would pray about how we feel so blessed
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.500]   as a result of each of these things,
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.940]   whether it's Joseph's coat
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.360]   or whether it's the creation of the world,
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.680]   which is one of them.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.040]   We can get lost in, of course we're thankful for the Lord
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.100]   and we're thankful for the world,
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.060]   but what are we thankful about this world?
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.780]   And when they were younger, it was very simple.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.100]   It would be things like what do you look outside today
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.820]   and are thankful for?
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.640]   But as the children aged
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.620]   and as their spiritual understanding was bigger,
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.460]   some of their prayers were really meaningful to my heart
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.020]   when I would listen.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.860]   - That's neat.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.100]   I love it that you brought up the fact
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.100]   that we as grownups can have our hearts softened
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.880]   and our gaze directed by the prayers of our children.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.420]   And it's really true that each of our children is a soul.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.180]   Each of our children is a soul
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.500]   that has been created by the Lord
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.020]   and they have a different perspective
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.100]   and they can sometimes help us to see truths
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.100]   that maybe our personalities are not as quick to recognize
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.380]   as quick to recognize.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.140]   I think that's beautiful.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.180]   So if you were, 'cause we're talking
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.180]   about the scribblers habits of praying together,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.900]   playing together, exploring together and so on.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.620]   We're talking about those habits and using those habits
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.060]   as a way to simplify our celebration of Christmas.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.060]   If you were gonna pray about celebrating Christmas,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.480]   'cause like we've got listeners who are thinking,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.260]   well, that's really cool, but how would I do that?
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.740]   So help us think, Karen, if you were gonna pray
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.620]   about celebrating Christmas, what would you pray?
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.620]   - I think for myself, I can get not tied up necessarily
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.460]   in the material aspects of Christmas,
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.700]   but the creating of memories of Christmas
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.140]   can become a very heavy load and making sure
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.300]   it's just like last year or exactly what my kids expected
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.880]   or that I thought through all the things
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.040]   that there's a sense in which a lot
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.180]   of the Christmas traditions which are so beautiful
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.180]   can become bondage.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.540]   And so I often pray during this time,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.020]   especially now that I don't have kids at home,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.580]   that I don't put too much importance
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.500]   on the traditions and the celebration,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.020]   but instead I keep going back to the meaning for this season
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.040]   and that I put my importance and my efforts
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.980]   on things that would glorify the Lord.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.980]   And I think sometimes Pinterest does not glorify the Lord.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.140]   That's where I want to head.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.780]   I want it to look like a little Hallmark commercial.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.080]   - That is so not restful for most of us, isn't it?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.380]   - Right.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.980]   I remember one year, my kids were teenagers
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.520]   and we were gonna go traveling
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   and we had a Christmas tree that the kids put up
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.220]   and they were real grumbly.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.540]   It was just a year that we were,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.140]   they did not want to travel.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.380]   They wanted to stay home for Christmas,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.180]   but we were going to see grandparents
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.700]   and we had a naked tree standing in our living room
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.180]   for about three days.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.640]   And then I had a meltdown and just said,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.300]   "We have to get the," and I made a huge, huge deal of it.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.740]   It really was not at all godly in my response to this.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.060]   And I remember afterwards that they grudgingly
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.980]   put all the lights on and put all the ornaments on.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.340]   And I remember afterwards thinking,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.380]   "Wouldn't it have been better for me to make a memory
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.920]   "of remember the year that we had a naked Christmas tree,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.400]   "but were peaceful."
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.440]   - Oh, wow.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.120]   - And that was, I go back to that very often in my heart
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.600]   and say, "You know what?
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.500]   "My view of what a perfect Christmas day is
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.680]   "or a Christmas tradition is needs to totally be bathed
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.060]   "in prayer and given to the Lord as a worship."
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.940]   And I think it would have been more worshipful
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.820]   to the Lord to have a naked Christmas tree that year.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.740]   - You know what?
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.620]   That is so, so wise.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.980]   I think you're really right.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980]   We, as moms, and dads too to some extent,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.780]   get so focused on creating these perfect vignette experiences
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.780]   for our children, thinking that's what they're gonna remember.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.880]   - Absolutely.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.520]   - But you know what I have discovered?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   My kids sometimes do not remember the hallmark moment,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.920]   the picture, because what they remember is the feeling
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   or the stress that went into producing that moment.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   And they remember the oddest, to me, the oddest things
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:23.320]   because they were not, many times the stuff
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.900]   that my kids remember, I didn't spend any effort
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.620]   that I noticed on.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.420]   I did not orchestrate that at all.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.980]   This moment that they remember or this event
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.200]   that they remember or this feeling that they remember
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.820]   was organic, it came from, like what you have said,
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.540]   when we were all happy together, when there was peace
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.020]   in our home, or when we just embraced some funny,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.020]   semi-tragic thing, I mean tragic in my perfectionistic mind.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.540]   You know, we just embraced the silly.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.740]   The year that the lights on our Christmas tree died,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   one strand at a time just infuriated me.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.020]   But eventually we just had to laugh.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.460]   And that is a memory that our family has.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   And really, the memory is how crazy it made Mama
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.740]   and then that she was able finally to laugh at it.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.780]   That's a better memory.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.780]   I like your idea about praying for our attitudes
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.500]   and praying for our celebrations and pursuing,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.540]   I guess what you're saying, Karen, is that we are pursuing
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.800]   the traditions or pursuing the memories
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.480]   for the right reasons.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.460]   - Yes, because if it were my two year old's birthday
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.720]   that I was celebrating, I would be focused
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.800]   on my two year old.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.300]   And since it's Christ's birthday that I'm celebrating,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.760]   I need to really work on being focused on Christ
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.380]   and not on my family.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.460]   And that is hard.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.260]   - Oh wow, I'm writing that down.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.260]   - Focusing on Christ's birthday, not our family
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:14.180]   or our family moments or memories or, that is great.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.680]   And you know what, I think that's something
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.100]   that we're all gonna have to pray about.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.140]   'Cause that does not, first, it's sad,
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.260]   but that's not maybe natural.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.640]   That's not the first thing.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   And when we live in the world where Christmas is so glitzy
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.420]   and jolly and loud and stuff oriented,
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:43.100]   it is difficult to keep things simple.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:48.980]   Well, I would love for us to read one of the most famous
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.260]   Christmas prayers.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   It's in Luke and it's commonly known as the Magnificat.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.280]   It's the prayer that Mary prayed
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.820]   after the angel Gabriel visited her.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.820]   And in Latin, it means my soul magnifies the Lord.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.820]   All right, so we're gonna start in verse 26.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.840]   So it's Luke chapter one.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.340]   We're gonna start in verse 26, which is before her prayer,
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.860]   but it kind of sets up the prayer, okay?
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.860]   So here we go, Luke chapter one, verse 26.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:41.460]   And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.940]   unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.900]   to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.260]   of the house of David and the virgin's name was Mary.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.780]   And the angel came into her and said,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.860]   "Hail, thou that art highly favored,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.860]   "the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women."
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:15.300]   And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   and cast in her mind what manner of salutation
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.900]   this should be.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.220]   And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary,
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.320]   "for thou hast found favor with God.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.080]   "And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   "and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.140]   "He shall be great and shall be called
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.420]   "the son of the highest and the Lord God
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.420]   "shall give unto him the throne of his father David.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.580]   "And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.760]   "and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.200]   Then said Mary unto the angel,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   "How shall this be seeing I know not a man?"
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.380]   And the angel answered her and said unto her,
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.440]   "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.260]   "and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.260]   "Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:31.540]   "shall be called the son of God.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.740]   "And behold thy cousin Elizabeth,
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.220]   "she hath also conceived a son in her old age
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.060]   "and this is the sixth month with her
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.560]   "who was called barren.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   "For with God nothing shall be impossible."
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   And Mary said, "Behold the handmaiden of the Lord,
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.260]   "be it unto me according to thy word."
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.100]   And the angel departed from her.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.020]   And Mary rose in those days
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.980]   and went into the hill country with haste
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.340]   into a city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.300]   who saluted and saluted Elizabeth.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.380]   And it came to pass that when Elizabeth
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.020]   heard the salutation of Mary,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.940]   the babe leaped in her womb
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.940]   and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.600]   And she spake out in a loud voice and said,
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.820]   "Blessed art thou among women
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.240]   "and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.760]   "And whence is this to me
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.340]   "that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.700]   "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.880]   "sounded in mine ears,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.920]   "the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.740]   "And blessed is she that believed
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   "for there shall be performance of those things
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.620]   "which were told her from the Lord."
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.660]   Now here's the Magnificat starting in verse 46.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.660]   And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.820]   "and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.600]   "for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.080]   "for behold from henceforth all generations
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.200]   "shall call me blessed.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   "For he that is mighty hath done to me great things
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.660]   "and holy is his name.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.960]   "And his mercy is on them that fear him
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.160]   "from generation to generation.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.540]   "He hath showed strength with his arm.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.920]   "He hath scattered the proud
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.640]   "in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.560]   "He hath put down the mighty from their seats
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.940]   "and exalted them of low degree.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.020]   "He hath filled the hungry with good things
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.320]   "and the rich he hath sent away empty.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.160]   "He hath helped his servant Israel
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.300]   "in remembrance of his mercy.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.220]   "And he spake to our fathers to Abraham
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.720]   "and to his seed forever."
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.620]   So that's Mary's reaction to the angel coming
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.840]   to tell her this most unexpected
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.200]   and frankly outlandish tale, okay?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.680]   So let me ask you, Karen,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   do you think that you would have reacted like Mary?
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.720]   - Don't we all wish we would have?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.020]   - Yes, yes.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.900]   I was hoping that you would be honest and say,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.220]   well, I wish I did.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.480]   I wish I would have.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.340]   I can't imagine how she was able to.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.180]   - And as young as she was, we know,
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.760]   I think of, there's a part of me that thinks
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.140]   of what an amazing person Mary's mother must have been
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.680]   to have raised this young lady to accept God's will
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   that is so outside her comfort zone and so amazing.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.760]   And well, it's basically a miracle
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.320]   and she just steps into the miracle
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.800]   and says, glorify it, magnify the Lord with my body.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.120]   - Right, it's amazing to me.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   Absolutely amazing to me that she had that maturity.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.680]   So you gave us a little bit,
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.960]   you think that she was able to react that way
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.000]   because of the teaching of her mother.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.360]   Anything else?
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.840]   - I know that there was certainly a culture
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.200]   that so many of the young women were named Mary
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.240]   in anticipation of the coming of the Christ.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   That was a hope that every mom hoped their daughter
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.160]   would be the answer to that prayer.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.520]   And so I'm sure that that part of being that culture,
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.940]   but honestly, how can you think it was you?
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.140]   We all thought that was gonna happen,
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.680]   but not to me, a little--
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.960]   - Right, and it had been so long since the prophecies
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.040]   that they had been hearing that for so long and waiting.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.880]   - And I have to think that in the same way
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.800]   that the Lord prepared Elizabeth's heart
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.040]   for Mary's coming with the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.900]   the Lord must have prepared Mary's heart
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.280]   for this information because it doesn't make any sense
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.280]   for her to go from gathering water and food for her family
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.200]   and just being a young, engaged woman
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.640]   to sure, why not, I'll get pregnant and have the Messiah.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.320]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.680]   - Right, well, and in this culture,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.860]   so she's not married, she's not married.
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.240]   And so here is an angel, a heavenly being,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.960]   telling her that she's gonna have a baby.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.120]   And she's like, that's not actually possible.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.500]   Physically, that's not gonna happen.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.400]   And then when the angel says, the Holy Spirit
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.280]   is gonna do this amazing thing,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   she just says, okay, I thank you.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.960]   I will do what you ask.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.120]   - I do think that probably her time spent
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.680]   with Elizabeth in Zechariah was a time spent in scripture.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.400]   And they are both priests and knew the word,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.440]   from a priestly family, and knew the word.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.120]   And so I can just imagine them pouring over
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.400]   what do we know about the Messiah?
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.840]   Just all the verses, pulling out Isaiah
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.400]   and pulling out all the different times
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.000]   or things that they knew about the Messiah
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.840]   and trying to prepare Mary for what was going on.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.680]   She didn't just go to hear Elizabeth's prayer.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.640]   I think the Lord really sent her to Elizabeth
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.240]   to be steeped in what was coming for her.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.700]   - That's great, that's a really good insight.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:56.280]   How would you describe her response to the message?
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.440]   I mean, she doesn't sound like she's shocked,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.300]   although I would imagine she would have to be shocked.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.040]   - Right, well there certainly is a big time difference
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.920]   between her meeting with the angel
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.140]   and then having this prayer.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.880]   So there was some conflation going on there.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.640]   - Right, right, right, right.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.680]   - And we didn't hear the rest of her conversation.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   Certainly some of the things she might have said
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.920]   to Elizabeth probably didn't sound like this.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.480]   But she does resolve her heart
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.620]   to do what the Lord asks of her.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.160]   And I think she has to know
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   this is gonna be a really hard journey.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.640]   But I think that that's usually when we are closest
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.080]   to the Lord is during a really hard journey.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.240]   - And I imagine that she in many ways did not know,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.120]   she knew it would be hard
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.920]   because it was gonna start out hard.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.280]   There was gonna be stigma attached
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.300]   to her carrying a child before she was married.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.200]   So it's gonna be hard.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.300]   But I think that she probably did not know
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.840]   how hard it would be to watch him die
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.280]   when she was thinking about him being born.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.720]   And I think, so often I think,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.520]   Lord, thank you that you have not shown me the future
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.020]   before I'm prepared for it.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.760]   And so in many ways, I think that it was a blessing
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.200]   that she didn't know everything.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.900]   I think that her response to the message
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   was pretty amazingly accepting of whatever it was.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.080]   It's kind of like the anything else clause
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.560]   a lot of people feel like they have with their job.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.480]   And so I'm saying yes to this.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.140]   And I don't know exactly what it means
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.700]   or what it will look like, but I accept it.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.440]   - I love the fact that after this time with Elizabeth,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.920]   when she does pray this prayer, she is not meek.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.200]   This is not a prayer of somebody who's like,
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.440]   oh, downtrodden and whatever you want.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.400]   She really is very passionate and resolute in this prayer.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.520]   And she recites from generation to generation
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.240]   and all the good things she's seen the Lord do.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.800]   And he spake to her father's Abraham.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.640]   She just recites what she knows to be true
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.440]   of the God of the Israelites.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.900]   And so she is resolute.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.720]   And I'm sure she had to go back to this prayer herself
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.880]   over and over again to continue to be resolute,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.320]   not just in the time that she was pregnant and giving birth,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.960]   but in all the years of raising Jesus.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.780]   And then letting him go.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.680]   - Yes.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.800]   I love that.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.680]   That is so good.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.460]   And that is one of the things I want for us to think about
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.220]   as we think about praying together
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   as a way to celebrate Advent simply.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.220]   The, her prayer shows us that she is remembering
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   who God is and who he has been to her people
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.280]   throughout the ages.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.660]   And I think that prayer can do that for our family
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.660]   when we stop and we pray, not just for the situations
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.000]   or the people that leap to mind,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.800]   but when we pray prayers of adoration,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.700]   looking at who God is and what he's done for us,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.700]   how he has acted with such faithfulness and patience
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.120]   and mercy in the past, I think it really softens our heart,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.960]   our hearts for the celebration of Advent.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.400]   What do you think, what would you say
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   is the main message of Mary's prayer?
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.600]   - I feel like it comes down to the power
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   and goodness of God is that time and time again,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.380]   God has shown his strength with his arm.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.840]   He has put down the mighty, he has filled the hungry,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.200]   he has helped his servant Israel,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   all these things he's done, not because of human people,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.040]   but because of who God was.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.900]   For generation to generation, he has been faithful.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.760]   I was reading a quote by Deirdre Bonhoeffer
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.040]   about Mary's Magnificat, and he says,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.300]   "This song has none of the sweet, nostalgic,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   "or even playful tones of some of our Christmas carols.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.120]   "It is instead a hard, strong, inexorable song
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   "about the power of God and the powerlessness of humankind."
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.320]   - That is so good.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   What if your family prayed prayers together
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   as you prepared for Advent, designed to remind you,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.240]   not just what the God of the Bible has done through the ages,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.040]   but prayers designed for your family to look back
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   and remember the ways that God has shown
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   his faithfulness to you, the situations
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.120]   that God has brought your family through,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   the times when you looked for a miracle and found one,
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.300]   the times when you really didn't know where to turn
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.880]   and God answered in a way that it would never
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.860]   have occurred to you to pray for.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:31:01.000]   I wonder how much more full of joy
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.900]   our celebration of Christmas could become
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.400]   if we used our prayers to remember
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.640]   the goodness and faithfulness of God.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.180]   That's really cool.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.960]   I think that's the great example
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.720]   that we can take from Mary's response.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.240]   How do you think she started to prepare herself
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.360]   for the birth?
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.680]   I mean, do you think she got it,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.040]   that this is gonna be the Messiah
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.140]   that people had longed for?
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.440]   What kind of preparations do you think she made?
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.200]   - I think there had to be a banked excitement in her.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   Because absolutely, she realized that this was
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.860]   an answer to the prayers of the people of Israel.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.920]   I don't think she had a clue what type of Messiah
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.240]   it would be, 'cause nobody did.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   I think they expected overthrow Rome.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.400]   - Yes, they had a different picture in their mind.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.360]   - Right, and so I'm sure it made it harder to believe
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.960]   that he was gonna be born to this poor family
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   if he was gonna come and overthrow Rome.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   That dichotomy in Mary's mind had to be there.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.120]   Because they didn't see the two comings of Christ,
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.800]   they put them in all as one.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.960]   So I think she understood that this was the answer
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.400]   to generations of prayers and hope of the people.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   But I don't think she had the crucifixion in her mind at all.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.280]   - Yes, I think you're right.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.360]   I think you're right.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   I think she obviously began to prepare herself
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.480]   to have a baby, and I think she prepared herself
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.440]   to be what God was asking her to be.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.200]   And I think she prepared by trusting God to make her
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.640]   and provide for her whatever she was gonna need to have
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.360]   or whatever she needed to become
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   in order to accept this blessing that he bestowed on her.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.960]   - I think the seeking out of Elizabeth
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.360]   as a godly older woman who could speak to her
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.480]   certainly showed part of her preparation.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.040]   And then also seeking out Elizabeth
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.240]   because God was doing an amazing thing in her life.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.840]   And so that can strengthen your faith
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.920]   when you surround yourself with people
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.840]   who have also seen God do great things.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.680]   - That's great.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.640]   Maybe that's one of the ways that we can get ready
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.720]   to celebrate Advent with our families,
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   to seek out people who know God and who have seen him work
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   and can tell us some stories and can give us some examples
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.960]   of the power and might and goodness and love of the Lord.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.120]   - If you think of that exploring word
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   from the scribblers list, exploring the stories
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   of people that we know who have walked with God
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   is what a delight that is and how often
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.680]   people love to tell those stories.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   And it's a blessing to them to have to tell them again.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.400]   - That is great.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.320]   That is great.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:37.080]   Families, as you prepare your hearts for Advent,
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   it might be strange to think that prayer, praying together
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:50.760]   could help you prepare for a deeper Advent season,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.440]   but I think it can.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.040]   And I'm suggesting that we all try that.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   I intend for our family to intentionally pray together,
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.200]   asking the Lord to deepen our preparation
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   and deepen our celebration for this Advent season.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.600]   Karen, I have one more question for you.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.400]   - I think that a lot of times, as Christians,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.640]   when we become convicted that we need to prepare
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.000]   for Christmas in a different way,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.840]   we can sometimes look down or look sideways
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.600]   at people who are not preparing their hearts
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.880]   or not celebrating in the way that we think
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.680]   the holidays should be celebrated and the way that we know
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.280]   the Lord would want us to celebrate the birth of Christ.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   How can we reflect this preparation of our hearts
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.760]   for this season and lead others to celebrate Christmas
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   more deeply without being preachy or holier than thou?
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.720]   How could we be a light in our neighborhood
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.080]   or to our extended family without turning people off?
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.040]   - Always a difficult question.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.800]   I save it for the end, just for that purpose.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.120]   - I think when we are convicted of things,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.640]   sometimes it is too tempting to become a zealot.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.440]   And I think that one of the ways we could do it
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.640]   is just telling the story of how this is working for us.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:39.120]   When I was thinking through this was an easy way to pray,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.320]   one of the things I thought of is the Israelites
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.280]   did stones of remembrance.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.040]   - Oh, that's lovely.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.360]   - And I thought, what if we got some jingle bells
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.400]   or something and they were our stone of remembrance.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.000]   And every day when we prayed about something,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.520]   we put the bells in a jar on the mantle or whatever.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.320]   And that would be easy, but it would be something
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.480]   our kids could hold and they could get all of them out.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.320]   When we had two, we'd have two out, when we have three,
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.080]   we'd have three out and they'd get bigger and bigger.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.520]   The noise would be noisier and noisier.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.080]   And I just thought, wouldn't that be something
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.800]   that would be fun to share with somebody?
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.120]   We did this thing and this is what my four-year-old said
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.440]   or this is what my seven-year-old said.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.560]   And it was very meaningful to us.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.520]   That's very palatable.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.440]   And it's just gently telling our own story
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.000]   of something simple that we did.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   That's not even hard.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.800]   It doesn't have to be crafted or look pretty
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.240]   or have any words on the jar or anything,
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.520]   just a bell jar and some jingle bells.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.620]   And what a delight that could end up being.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.120]   And what we're always taught to do is to share
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.980]   our testimonies, so sharing our testimonies of prayer
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.480]   could also be a way to share this concept.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.200]   - Yes, yes.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.880]   Not in a preachy way, but in a,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.400]   this is helping our family celebrate in a way
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.300]   that we've never done before and this feels good
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.220]   and it feels rich and it feels real.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.240]   I think that's lovely.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.080]   I love that.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.000]   I love the jingle bell.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.320]   I may try that with my grandson.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.800]   That's the sweetest thing.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.840]   I love it, Karen.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.680]   Thank you.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.840]   That's really good.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:20.640]   Listeners, I hope that this has given you something
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   to think about and maybe some hope for a way
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   that your family can celebrate the season more simply
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.440]   and more deeply by praying together.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.160]   Join us every Tuesday in December.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.400]   We're gonna look at one of the other scribblers verbs
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   and how that activity can draw your family
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.480]   into a rich yet simple celebration of this Advent season.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.200]   And you know, I've been talking about scribblers,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.280]   scribblers, scribblers.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.520]   Some of you may know about one of our newest resources.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.200]   It's called Scribblers at Home,
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.840]   recipes from lifelong learners.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.880]   Some of you may never have heard of this
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.800]   but I wanna tell you just a little bit
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.120]   because it might possibly make a great Christmas present
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   for a family that you know.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   If you know a family that really enjoys learning together
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.220]   and playing together and doing things together,
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   you could give them the gift of scribblers magic
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.440]   this Christmas.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.460]   Scribblers at Home recipes from lifelong learners
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.740]   is full of fun step-by-step activities
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.740]   that use art and music and history and science and math
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:51.040]   to make education a joyful pursuit for the whole family.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.400]   It really encourages families to learn together
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.140]   through intentional play.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.840]   Even if you don't belong
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.600]   to a classical conversations community,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.420]   scribblers will bring joy to every learner in the family
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.760]   no matter what age.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.840]   It's not bound to an end community program.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.680]   So even if you have friends or family members
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.400]   who don't do classical conversations
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.640]   or who don't even homeschool,
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.240]   they may find that this is a really fun way
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.320]   to spend time together learning as a family.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.280]   Make a family's Christmas unforgettable this year
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.400]   with scribblers.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.780]   And if you want to learn more,
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   visit classicalconversations.com/scribblers, all right?
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:43.000]   Karen, thank you so much for helping
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   this first Advent podcast to touch a great chord.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.120]   I appreciate you, my friend.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.640]   - My pleasure.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.920]   - All right, guys, we will see you next week.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.860]   (gentle music)
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.360]   (music fades)
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
