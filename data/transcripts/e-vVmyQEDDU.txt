[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   Previously on Grace To You. If you're going to show that the gospel transformed you,
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.960]   you can't be a rebellious wife. There's the assumption that something in Christ is now
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.600]   possible that apart from Christ was not possible or not like.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.980]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.480]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.960]   We have found ourselves now in the fifth chapter of Ephesians in a section that deals
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.880]   with marriage. We're going to be looking at that this morning with particular attention
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.200]   to the husband. So this is your day, men, to hear from heaven about your responsibility as a husband.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   Let me read chapter 5 of Ephesians, starting at verse 22 and down through verse 33.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:32.640]   This is the divine design and order for a marriage that can be, in spite of fallenness,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.420]   the grace of life. Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920]   For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100]   He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ,
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.020]   so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in every way.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.560]   Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.000]   for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.180]   the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.060]   or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless. So, husbands,
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020]   ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife, his wife,
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.020]   is the one who will be the most holy and blameless. The same is true for husbands. Husbands should
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.020]   love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife, his wife, and his wife, and his wife,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.220]   loves his own wife, loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.860]   and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.460]   For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.020]   and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reverence to
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.860]   Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:03.460]   wife, even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.140]   Now backing up to verse 18, just to remind you, those who are spirit-filled, verse 18,
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.840]   filled with the Spirit; those who are joyful worshipers, verse 19; those who are constantly
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.700]   thankful, verse 20; and those who are mutually submissive are not. Those who are mutually
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.080]   faithful are the ones who are going to enjoy the richness of marriage as the grace of life.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.720]   I want to pick it up at verse 25 and the duty of the husband. And it's so simple and impossible to
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.520]   misunderstand one command: "Husbands, love your wives." Nothing about authority there,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.540]   nothing about dominance, nothing about ruling, nothing about subjecting.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:04.960]   Nothing about commanding. "Husbands, love your wives." That defines the kind of headship
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.040]   in a marriage that God desires. Obviously, it's never abusive, it's never overbearing,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   it's never inconsiderate, it's never thoughtless, it's never harsh, it's never unkind. So husbands,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.380]   it's pretty simple: the responsibility is to love your wives. That's the duty of the husband.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:32.460]   That's the command. And this is to be generated by the husband. Understand, the command is
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.820]   to the husband to love. It says nothing about the wife, whether she's lovable or not, or
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.120]   whether she's occasionally lovable, or rarely lovable, or never lovable. It doesn't change
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.500]   the command, because the command is to love your wives. "What do you mean, love your wives?"
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.220]   "Oh, this is what I mean. Love your wives." "What do you mean, love your wives?" "Oh,
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.460]   this is what I mean. Love your wives." Verse 25: "Just as Christ also loved the church."
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.420]   Wow, that sets the standard pretty high. "Love your wives as Christ loved the church." What
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:17.440]   kind of love was that? Well, He proved His love for us while we were enemies. He loved
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.060]   us when we were unlovable. He loved us when we were rebellious. He loved us when we were
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:31.920]   full of hatred. He loved us when we were wretched, vile, sinful. That's the kind of love. This
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.720]   is not love that is won by the object. This is love that is given in spite of the failures
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:48.400]   of the object. Chrysostom, the golden-mouthed preacher in the fourth-century church, wrote
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.900]   this: "Hear the measure of this love. If it be needful
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:01.580]   that you should give your life for her, or be cut to pieces a thousand times, or endure
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.940]   anything whatever, refuse it not. Christ bought His church and brought His church to His feet
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:19.500]   by His great love, not by threats nor any such thing. So do you conduct yourself toward
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.740]   your wife."
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.560]   He understood exactly what this is saying. "Love your wife?" "How? How do I love my
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.080]   wife? What do you mean by that?" I mean, "Love your wife as Christ also loved the church."
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.380]   That's the model, and that's the pattern, and no less than that.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.880]   Now this is just stunning in the context of the people of Ephesus and the Roman world,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.580]   because Roman law basically translated as "the law of the world." It's a very, very
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.740]   clear definition. They treated women as if they were slaves. They were less than human.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.900]   In fact, Cato, writing Roman law, says this: "If you were to catch your wife in an act
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.540]   of infidelity, you may kill her without a trial. But if she were to catch you, she would
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:22.420]   not venture to touch you with her finger. She has no such right." Well, that's the role
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.100]   in ancient Rome.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:34.140]   So what God is saying through the apostle Paul is shocking: "Love your wives, and love
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:45.780]   them as Christ also loved the church." This sets the standard so high.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.260]   There are several considerations with regard to defining this love over in 1 Peter 3. If
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:59.360]   you look at it for just a moment, 1 Peter 3:7, you get a little more insight into it.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.200]   And we looked at this briefly last week. "You husbands, in the same way" - and these
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:14.440]   are some of the ways that love expresses itself - "live with your wives first in an understanding
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:22.100]   way." This love demands understanding, knowledge, some translations say.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:31.340]   "Knowing her sensitivity, knowing her feelings, knowing her needs." This is not some macho,
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:38.820]   independent, insensitive kind of dominance that we're talking about. But rather, it is
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:47.720]   living in a way that displays the fact that you are in touch with the depth of her understanding,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.940]   her feelings, her thoughts, her desires.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:09:00.960]   Secondly, it calls not only for such consideration, but even for chivalry as with someone weaker
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.440]   since she is a woman. Not weaker intellectually, not weaker in terms of wisdom, not weaker
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.620]   in any spiritual sense. But by God's design, man is stronger. He is the protector. He is
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.780]   the provider. He is the source of security and strength in the union. She should know
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.780]   that.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:30.160]   She should feel protected. She should feel secure. You are her knight in shining armor.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.660]   And then thirdly, not only consideration and a measure of chivalry, but you should
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:46.820]   show her honor. So this love encompasses showing honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.620]   In other words, you're treating her like a believer. You're treating her like it's the
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.620]   communion of the saints.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:58.380]   So what does it mean to love the way Christ loved the church? Okay, he's going to tell
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:07.220]   us. First, verse 25: "He gave himself up for her." He gave himself up for her. That's
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:14.820]   where it starts. It is self-sacrificing loves. The Spirit-filled husband loves his wife not
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.460]   for what she can do for him, but for what he can do for her. That kind of love seeks
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.460]   only her joy.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:32.060]   That's how that love works. And that's the way Christ loved, right? Philippians, chapter
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.760]   2, he didn't hold on to what he had in glory, equality with God, but he took on the form
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.520]   of a servant, humbled himself to death, even death on the cross. Why did he do that? It
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:51.300]   was condescending sacrifice for the objects of his divine love. A real love that is not
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:59.600]   a sacrifice is never tyrannical. A real love is always sacrificial. This is a Christlike
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:06.980]   love. You have to find every possible way that you can demonstrate setting yourself
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:15.880]   aside for the sake of your spouse. It's love that is that selfless. It really involves
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.140]   the death of self. This is the key to a good marriage.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:27.160]   It's the death of self, particularly the death of self in the husband, so that he is
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.900]   characterized by the love that is defined in Scripture in 1 Corinthians 13. You remember
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:41.140]   this, right? Love is patient. Think of this in your marriage. Love is patient. Love is
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:50.980]   kind. It is not jealous. Love does not brag. It is not arrogant. It does not act unbecomingly.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:58.220]   It does not seek its own. It is not provoked. It does not take into account a wrong suffered.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.820]   It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.360]   believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.660]   Okay, that's divine love. That's the kind of love that's shed abroad in our hearts by
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:20.820]   the Holy Spirit through salvation, and that is how a husband is to love his wife. And,
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.800]   by the way, all of those things that I read out of 1 Corinthians 13 are verbs, verbs,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.820]   not static nouns. He's not describing love as if you could take a snapshot. He's showing
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:41.700]   it as if it's a video. It's a way of life. It's help and humble service as a continual
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.040]   flow of life.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.660]   Death to self is critical, and that's a spiritual reality, right? "Take up your cross and follow
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.480]   the way of life." "Die daily. Be crucified with Christ. Look not on your own things."
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.740]   Now this is really the starting point of this kind of love. You've got to do away with your
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:09.500]   self. You might think about it this way. Here's how you could describe dying to self: "When
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.880]   you are forgotten or neglected or purposely set aside, and you sting and hurt with the
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.500]   insult of the oversight, but your heart is happy, being counted worthy to suffer for
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   Christ."
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.880]   That is dying to self. "When your good is evil spoken of, when your wishes are crossed,
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.580]   your advice disregarded, your opinions ridiculed, and you refuse to let anger rise in your heart
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.400]   or even defend yourself, but take it all in patient, loving silence." That is dying to
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   self. "When you lovingly and patiently bear any disorder, any irregularity, any annoyance,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.340]   when you can stand face to face with folly and extravagance and insensibility and endure
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:58.300]   the pain of death, when you are content with any food, any offering, any clothing, any
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.680]   climate, any society, any solitude, any interruption, by the will of God." That is dying to self.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.980]   "When you never care to refer to yourself in a conversation or record your own good
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:17.820]   works or itch after commendation, when you can truly love to be unknown." That is dying
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.180]   to self. "When you see another prosper and prosper, and you are content with what you
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.580]   are, and have his needs met, and can honestly rejoice with him in spirit and feel no envy
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.220]   nor question God while your own needs are far greater, and in desperate circumstances."
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.360]   That is dying to self. "When you can receive correction and reproof from one of less importance
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.060]   than yourself, and humbly submit inwardly as well as outwardly, finding no rebellion
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:50.020]   and no resentment rising in your heart." That is dying to self. I read that to you because I want you to understand
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:56.140]   the range of dying to self is vast. So first of all, if you're going to love your wife
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:03.540]   as Christ loves the church, it's a sacrificial love. Secondly, it's a purifying love. Go
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:10.120]   down to verse 26: "Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her so that He might
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:19.860]   sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word, that He might present
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:28.480]   to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:38.040]   that she would be holy and blameless." This is the model. This is the standard. You are
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.260]   not only to sacrifice for her, but you are to be the instrument that God uses to sanctify
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.700]   her, set her apart from sin, which means you don't
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:57.160]   lead her to do things that are sinful. You don't hit the hot buttons that start arguments
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:05.020]   because you're angry and trigger hostility with her. That's inducing sinful response.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:12.280]   Why? Because you are committed, as Christ was, to the glory of His church. I love that:
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:19.540]   the church in all her glory, endoxon, all her splendor. The word could be translated
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:27.300]   "real beauty." And the real beauty of a woman is that inward beauty, right? That's back
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:33.820]   to 1 Peter again, not the clothing that she wears and the jewelry, but the hidden beauty
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.680]   of the heart. So you are concerned with her true beauty,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:49.380]   which means you're concerned with her true purity. You desire that she be without spot.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:56.920]   Stain is the word in the Greek, or wrinkle, which means a flaw, or any such thing. You
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:07.160]   don't want anything to mar the beauty of your wife, and the beauty of your wife is defined
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.220]   at the end of verse 27 as holy and blameless.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:19.220]   Christ purifies His church by washing His church with the Word, and that is the role
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:30.620]   of the husband, to be the cleansing instrument, using the Word of God to wash His wife so that
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:40.780]   her true beauty can be seen. Jesus prayed, "Sanctify them by Thy truth; Thy Word is truth."
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:47.460]   The Word is the sanctifying agent. The Word cleanses. Christ loves His church enough to
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.060]   sacrifice Himself for it.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:55.000]   He loves His church enough to sacrifice Himself for it, and to then go on cleansing His church
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.880]   so that she would be without spot or wrinkle, and holy and blameless.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:09.380]   What a beautiful picture of how a husband is the sanctifying instrument of the Spirit
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:18.900]   of God for his wife. So sacrifice and purity mark Christ's life.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:30.920]   Christ is the standard, and His love for the church is the standard. There's a third thing
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:38.140]   to say about this: we are to love our wives not only in a sacrificing and purifying way,
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:46.340]   but in a caring way. And that's what we see in verses 28 to 30: "So husbands ought also
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.740]   to love their own wives as their own bodies."
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:55.660]   In other words, you are one flesh. You're to love your wife as your own body. He who
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.420]   loves his own wife loves himself. In other words, if you want the best for yourself,
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:08.420]   then love your wife, because you really are inseparable from her, and her contentment
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:17.580]   and her reciprocating love will be your greatest joy. No one ever hated his own flesh, verse
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580]   29 says.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.860]   He nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:29.580]   And here we're back to Christ again: in the same way that Christ cherishes and nourishes
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:38.480]   His church, in the same way that He desires the best, that He offers continual care.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.460]   You know, I think about the fact that He has given us all things that pertain to life and
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.480]   godliness.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:51.200]   I think about earlier in the book of Ephesians, how much does Christ love us?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   He loves us enough, if you look at chapter 1, that He chose us before the foundation
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.320]   of the world, that He adopted us, that He redeemed us.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.720]   Verse 7: "That He forgave us."
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:13.600]   And all of this He lavished, He lavished on us.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.480]   Amen.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.060]   This is lavish care.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:26.740]   We have been blessed - verse 3 - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.680]   in Christ.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.520]   That's what this is talking about.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:42.600]   Bless your wife, sacrifice for her, be a purifying instrument of God in her life, and lavish
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   her.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.720]   That's what this is talking about.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.320]   "With all possible blessings."
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.000]   Marriage is difficult.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.060]   We get it.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.800]   We all have the same challenges.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.420]   Society strikes against us.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.580]   Satan's coming against us.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.140]   Our own flesh makes it hard.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.060]   But here are the patterns.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:11.480]   And the assumption is, if you are commanded to do with your wife what Christ does in loving
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.820]   His church, that you have the pattern.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.720]   And the assumption is, if you are commanded to do with your wife what Christ does in loving
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.480]   her, that you have the power to do that.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.980]   And of course, Romans 5 says, "God has shed His love abroad in your heart through His
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.980]   Holy Spirit."
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:27.060]   Now, there's one final point here that just sums up what we've already said, and it's
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.580]   in verse 32.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:39.460]   I described the manner of love like Christ had for His church, but here is the motive.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.460]   Here is the motive.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.840]   Obviously, there's a motive for your own self-love.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.900]   There's a motive for your own self-fulfillment, for your own well-being, for your own joy,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.900]   for your own happiness.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.240]   And by the way, for the happiness of your children.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:56.040]   Your children are only going to be as happy as you are content in your marriage.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.880]   You set the tone.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:06.020]   If you love the way Christ loved the church, men and women, if you submit the way the church
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.960]   submits to Christ, your children will be in the most healthy environment to most, most
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.720]   readily embrace the truth of the gospel.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:25.260]   But there's another thing beside just having a happy home that comes with this, and it's
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.220]   in verse 32.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.700]   This mystery is great.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.200]   This is a secret now to be revealed, not revealed before in Scripture.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.860]   What is the mystery?
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.840]   The mystery is I'm speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:50.780]   The mystery is this: that Christ and His relation to the church is the symbol that is demonstrated
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.740]   in marriage.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.160]   So you have responsibility not only for your own joy and happiness and that of your children
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.820]   and everybody else who intersects with your life, but you are given a responsibility to
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:09.160]   show the world the relationship between Christ and His church as demonstrated in your marriage.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.720]   Think about that.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:17.000]   Think about that responsibility, that that is the motive.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.300]   And if you come short of that, you have failed in what is a great, great opportunity.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.720]   It's a great sacred secret now revealed that Christian marriages can demonstrate to the
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.480]   world the relationship between Christ and His church.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.600]   Submissive, obedient wife.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:48.980]   Fulfilling all the responsibilities of love for her husband and her children.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:24:00.260]   A loving husband who is sacrificial, purifying, caring, and faithful.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:10.480]   This is the picture of marriage that demonstrates the relationship of Christ to His church.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:18.020]   In the end then is we need to ask ourselves, the closer people get to our marriage, do
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:23.040]   they get closer to seeing the relation between Christ and His church?
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.920]   Because that's the responsibility.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.960]   It's a high calling.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.360]   Being married is a very high calling.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.820]   It's the grace of life.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.400]   Don't embark upon it lightly, but when you do, understand that as a believer, you have
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.360]   now been given the responsibility.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.220]   To unfold the mystery of the relationship between Christ and His church, so that marriage
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:57.860]   is not only in itself a marvelous reality, but it is symbolic of the work of Christ and
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.340]   His love for His church.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:07.880]   So we have to think about whether our marriage demonstrates that.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.240]   And that takes us to verse 33.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.560]   And this is just a summation.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:22.620]   After all of this, each individual among you, let's get back to the beginning.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.000]   Love his own wife even as himself.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.120]   And we're back to love.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:35.200]   And the wife must see to it that she not obeys, but that she respects her husband.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.420]   What we're talking about in a marriage is not dominance and submission; we're talking
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.120]   about love.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.120]   Love and respect.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.120]   Okay?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.900]   We're talking about love and respect.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:57.240]   Those are the defining summary words: love and respect.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:05.300]   Love and respect will make a blessed marriage and a wonderful testimony of Christ and His
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.000]   church.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And we're talking about love and respect.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.880]   Love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880]   And love and respect is the most important thing in a marriage.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.000]   care for me and invest in the children.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.380]   Patricia has been really amazing.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.200]   She's been a model.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.820]   She's been a Proverbs thirty one woman.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.440]   But in addition to that, when I
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.320]   think about marriage, I can't think about it without thinking
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.940]   about all the people that have come out of that marriage.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.220]   Four kids, fifteen grandchildren,
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.860]   and five great grandchildren and counting.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.360]   And they're all still a part of our life.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.140]   This is the bliss of marriage.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.560]   It's not just one person for life.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.700]   It's family.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.500]   It's children.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.960]   So we reach 60.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.800]   That's a milestone.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.020]   But it's not just something the two of us share.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.260]   It's shared by our whole extended family.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.580]   They give back to us the joy and the love
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.900]   that we've invested in them.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.820]   So it's the best, the best of all possibilities
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.800]   in human life.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.400]   To get a copy of Pastor John's book,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.280]   The Fulfilled Family, for yourself
