[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480]   Kenneth from Starkville, Mississippi writes and to say this Pastor John
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.300]   I have been taking advantage of more and more of the resources at desiring God org lately
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.620]   And one of the things that stood out for me is the self exaltation of God
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.540]   You discussed how it is the most loving thing that God could do for us namely to exalt himself
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.080]   While it would be a sin for anyone else to do that. My question is almost the reverse of this
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.020]   Are there things that we are commanded to do by God that would be a sin if God did them?
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.160]   Specifically Jesus tells us to love our enemies
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.760]   Would it be a sin for God to love his non-human enemies like Satan and the fallen angels?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.680]   Or does he love them? Pastor John? What would you say to Kenneth?
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480]   Let me take those two questions
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360]   one at a time because
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.880]   the first one that I hear is
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   I think clear and easy to answer from Scripture the second one not so easy
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.680]   First he says Kenneth says
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.280]   Are there things that we are commanded to do?
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.080]   By God that would be sin if God did them and the answer is clearly
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.720]   Yes, I can think of half a dozen things
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.840]   That God commands us to do that would be sin for God to do
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.080]   He commands us to confess our sins to each other in James 5 16 confess your sins to one another and pray for one another
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.120]   It would be sin for God to confess his sins because he doesn't have any and that would be hypocrisy
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   second 1st Corinthians 12 21
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.880]   Every member of the body of Christ is told that we should never say to another person
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.520]   I have no need of you in the body of God have no need of you
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.240]   In other words human beings are all commanded and expected to admit our dependence on others
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.560]   And our need for others, but it would be sin for God to admit for a moment that he depended on
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   anything outside himself
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.080]   1725 God is not served by human hands as though he needed anything
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.680]   Since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything or to make almost the same point
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.880]   We're commanded in Proverbs 3 5 do not rely on your own understanding
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   And it would be sin for God not to rely on his own understanding
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.080]   It would be sin because he's
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040]   infallible and
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.720]   To fail to rely on his own infinite wisdom would make him a fool and God is not a fool. His understanding is
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   unsearchable and we're commanded to worship our Creator and God has no Creator and it would be a sin for him to try to
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.360]   Worship his Creator because he wasn't created and we're told in Romans 12 19 never avenge yourselves
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.320]   Leave it to the wrath of God. So it'd be a sin for God to renounce his prerogative
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.560]   Vengeance and judgment since it belongs to him uniquely and doesn't belong to us and the list could just go on and on
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.320]   So to be a creature
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.360]   Rather than a creator puts a person in a position with responsibilities and expectations
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.240]   That the Creator does not have so the answer to the first question is yes
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   There are many things in the Bible that we are commanded to do by God that it would be a sin if
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.040]   God did them and then Kenneth asks
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.080]   Specifically
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.400]   Jesus tells us to love our enemies. So would it be sin for God to love his
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:04.280]   Non-human enemies like Satan and the fallen angels or does he love them and he went in a direction there
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.120]   I did not expect him to go. He made it too easy
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.200]   I'm gonna I'm gonna answer what he asked, but he really I think he wants to ask a harder question than that
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.800]   Namely not just non-human enemies, but human enemies said that's the real tough question
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:28.360]   There's no evidence in the Bible that God loves Satan or the devils and there's no evidence in the Bible that we are
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.240]   commanded to love
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.840]   Satan or
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   his demons all
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.920]   All the commands go in the other direction. There's implacable
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.960]   opposition between God and the devil and us and the devil so I don't think
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   We're ever commanded to love the devil and God never gives any evidence of loving the devil
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.600]   he is beyond all redemption and therefore he has been handed over to his
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.160]   rebellion, but the the tougher question is
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   Whether God loves his human enemies the way he commands us to love
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.040]   Our human enemies and at one level the answer is yes
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.960]   But not at every level. In fact, Jesus tells us to
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.020]   Model our love of our enemies on his love of his enemies in Matthew 5 44. I say do you love your enemies?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.980]   Pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his son to
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.740]   Rise on the evil and the good in others
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.280]   He loves his enemies and sends rain on the just and the unjust so you treat your enemies that way, too
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.160]   But there's a difference isn't there? We are finite and do not know the deep heart condition of our enemies
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   We do not know the final
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.200]   trajectory of their unbelief in their hard hardness hardness of heart
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.080]   given our limitations
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   It is always right
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.240]   for us to pray and work for their temporal and
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.360]   Eternal good until they're dead
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.480]   But God does know the deep heart condition of our enemies
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.160]   He knows the final
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.400]   trajectory of their unbelief in their hardness. He knows whether he will exert an
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.720]   omnipotent
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.680]   saving influence in their lives and
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.240]   therefore what he expects from us in our
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.100]   ignorance and finiteness isn't the same as what he
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.720]   Exercises in his infinite wisdom and knowledge and power. He expects us
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.760]   To pray for their salvation work for their salvation until they're dead, but he does not always
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.680]   give that
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.560]   salvation x 1348 Ephesians 2 5 2nd Timothy 2 25 and 26 so I
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.920]   think the answer to Ken the second question is
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.960]   first
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.800]   neither God nor
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.280]   God's people are expected to love Satan and
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.760]   Second both God and his people love their human enemies, but not in the same way
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:31.440]   since God is all wise and all governing and we are finite and very
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.440]   limited in our understanding and wisdom
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.480]   Very interesting. Thank you pastor John and for more details about this podcast or to catch up on past episodes

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.400]   Who is scratching his head as he reads about Jesus saying in the Gospels that he is not seeking his own glory
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   Why was Jesus not seeking his own honor if that's what the Gospels are all about
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.360]   Anyways, we will find out on Wednesday. I'm your host Tony rank. You will see you then
