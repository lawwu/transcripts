[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   We have a question from Sebastian. He writes, "I am a youth group leader
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.600]   from Switzerland. What are the core values from the Bible to pass on to my
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.540]   youth group, or what are the really important things we should give our
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.360]   youth today?" Obviously a youth pastor can't develop a full
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.920]   systematic theology in the minds of his young people. He's got to choose some
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080]   really key things to drive home. Pastor John, what would you put at the top of
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.480]   the list of your priorities for Sebastian? I would probably put at the
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.320]   top, or maybe it would be better to say at the bottom, as foundation, a true Bible.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:49.280]   Help these young people be rock-solid and thrilled that they have a book in
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.640]   which the Creator of the universe has spoken the truth to them about Himself
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.000]   and about them and about the world. This is just stunning when you think about it.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.840]   If this is true, if the Bible is inspired by God, we have a book in which our
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.560]   Maker, our Creator, and the Sustainer, and the One who runs the universe has spoken
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.160]   to us the truth. There just can't be anything more significant for a young
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.520]   person's life than to have a book in his hand. This book, this book tells me where
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.560]   I came from. This book tells me the meaning of life. This book tells me how
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.120]   to live and what my future can be. So that's number one. Build every week,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.720]   every time you get together, use the Bible in such a way as to communicate. We
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.080]   have a book here that's foundational truth for living. Number two, I'd say a
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.160]   great God. So true Bible and a great God. Just constantly lift the sights of young
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.640]   people higher than they would go without your leadership, and higher means a
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.080]   greater and greater and greater view of God. Don't sink down to assume that
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.400]   they've got the level at which you should address them. So many people are
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   so eager for relevance that they let the young people dictate all the agenda, and
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.080]   the young people don't realize that the way you solve their agenda usually is by
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.160]   creating in their hearts a space for a massive God that reorients the whole
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.280]   agenda, and they see everything differently. So I would say number
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.160]   two is build into them a great God. Number three, I'd say teach them that
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   life is hard and suffering is coming, and that's an essential part of the
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.960]   Christian life. And number four, I'd say show them that the Christian life gives
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   them the deepest meaning possible. That even though life is hard, it is richer
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.800]   and deeper and more satisfying to have a significant life in Christ than any other
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.600]   any other way. And maybe one other thing, two other things come to mind. Give
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.840]   them an absolutely certain, confident, glorious future that no matter what
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.400]   happens, they have eternal life. Everything's going to work together for
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   their good. They're going to have a new heavens and a new earth. Every wrong will
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.720]   be made right. God will be exalted, and they will have everlasting joy no matter
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   what they have to sacrifice in this world on the way there. And the last
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.760]   thing, in, under, and around that, weave the gospel, the cross of Christ, that
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   Christ has covered all their sins and has provided all their righteousness as
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.360]   they trust in Him. Those are the radicals that I would build if I were leading some youth.
