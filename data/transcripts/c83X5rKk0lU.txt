[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.300]   We're gonna end this week talking about a marriage struggle.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.920]   We've talked about many of the struggles
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   and tensions marriages face over the years of this podcast.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.340]   Here's another one of those topics,
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.160]   one we haven't directly addressed yet.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.560]   It comes to us from a young wife
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.400]   who writes in anonymously to say this.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.240]   I have a question about your point
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.000]   that men owe women a special kind of care.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200]   You've made this point several times on this podcast.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.320]   In particular, Paul commands husbands
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840]   to not be harsh with their wives.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.800]   He says this in Colossians 3:19.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.880]   You say, quote, "This admonition to men
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.000]   "is owing to a peculiarly male temptation
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.200]   "to be rough, even cruel,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.360]   "and to a peculiarly female vulnerability
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.880]   "to that violence on the one hand,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.140]   "and to a natural female gladness on the other hand,
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.260]   "to be honored with caring protection
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.760]   "and strong tenderness," end quote.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.680]   My question is this.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.040]   My husband is not violent towards me, praise God,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.200]   but he is harsh.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.320]   He's just not a gentle man.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.120]   How should I approach this topic with him?
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.320]   - Well, if I'm talking to the husband,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.280]   so I need to just say this to get it out of the way
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.560]   and make sure it doesn't go unsaid.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.240]   If I were talking to the husband,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.480]   I would have lots to say,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.720]   biblically, spiritually, relationally,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.800]   about how he needs to deal with his own sins
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   and personality quirks or weaknesses,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.600]   but that's not the question she's asked.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.480]   She asked me, us,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   how can I most helpfully approach him on this topic?
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.560]   So that's what I'm gonna talk about,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   perhaps with, I think I have five suggestions.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.440]   So here they go.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.560]   First, I would encourage our friend
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   to pray both for her husband and for herself
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.280]   in this matter of his harshness.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.640]   Jesus said that we should ask God
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.920]   that his will would be done on earth,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.740]   that would include in our marriages,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.480]   as it's done in heaven,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.120]   and that includes that his will be done
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.080]   the way the angels would do it.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.920]   Husbands would love their wives
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.560]   and wives would love their husbands
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.760]   the way angels obey God,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.080]   namely joyfully and fully and without begrudging.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.940]   So it's completely fitting
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.600]   that she would intercede with her Father in heaven,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.920]   that her husband would be softened
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   and moved toward greater Christlikeness
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.720]   in his demeanor toward her.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.640]   And I say that she should pray for herself as well
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.280]   because even though he bears
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.220]   his own peculiar burden of responsibility
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.460]   before God for his own change,
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.840]   we know from Scripture and experience
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.440]   that God uses the behavior of husbands and wives
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.560]   to bring about change in each other.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.140]   He uses the people around us
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.280]   to affect the way we do things and feel about things.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.960]   So what God does in her
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.440]   will have an effect on what he does in him.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.060]   So she prays for herself as well.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.640]   Number two, in 1 Peter 3:1-2,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.320]   Peter says to wives that they should try
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   to bring about godly change in their husbands
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.820]   by means of their "respectful and pure conduct."
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.820]   In other words, Peter underlines
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.360]   what we know from experience
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   that a person may be helped in his deliverance
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.720]   from his own sinning by the godly way
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.480]   that others behave around him,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.100]   especially people close to him that he loves, like his wife.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.400]   I would guess that among the kind of conduct
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.260]   that God might use in the case of a harsh husband
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.120]   to bring about change would be what God said
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.880]   in Proverbs 15.1 for the wife, for example,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.340]   "A soft answer turns away wrath,"
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.020]   or maybe "turns away harshness."
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.020]   Or Proverbs 25.15, "A soft tongue will break a bone,
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.220]   "the bone of harshness."
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.220]   In other words, I would encourage her
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.220]   not to return evil for evil or harshness for harshness,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.220]   which will probably only spiral into a worse situation,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.900]   but rather to try to win him
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.020]   toward gentleness with gentleness.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.140]   Third, there will probably come a point
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.140]   where she desires and needs the support of others
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.180]   in this effort to love her harsh husband.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.980]   She will need them to pray for her and encourage her,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.300]   counsel her, but I would earnestly caution her
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.320]   against bad-mouthing her husband
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.660]   behind his back with other people.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.520]   This will almost certainly backfire
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.420]   in a more hopeless situation.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.180]   So then the question is, well, what can she do?
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.440]   Well, let me illustrate maybe what might happen.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.920]   During some of our darkest days of marriage,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.560]   Noelle and I both knew, we came to a point
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   where we knew we needed to have others to counsel us.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.440]   We weren't sure yet whether it needed
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.800]   to be a professional counselor, a Christian counselor,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.440]   which it did eventually,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.040]   but we wanted some friends to encourage us, pray for us,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.880]   where we could unburden ourselves,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.960]   be heard with sympathy and yet not naively
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.320]   as though everything is her fault or his fault.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.200]   We wanted others to pray for us.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.320]   So we knew we did not want to talk about our problems
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.200]   just randomly to everybody that came along.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.080]   That would have been harmful.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.240]   So we asked each other, we just agreed with each other
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   on a handful of very trusted friends,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.840]   and we gave each other the trusted permission
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.760]   to say anything that seemed helpful to say.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.520]   And ask that other couple not to share anything.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.120]   In fact, it was interesting,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.360]   one of the counselors that we did choose to go to
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.160]   insisted that we bring with us to every counseling session,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.440]   well, not everyone, but most of them,
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.840]   another couple with us.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.680]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.500]   What a strategy.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.880]   I thought that's really good.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.320]   I mean, it's a huge commitment of time
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.760]   for the other couple to invest,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.920]   but it means somebody else always knows
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.760]   what you're dealing with
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.880]   and you can't get away with too much when that's happening.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.120]   That requires an enormous amount of trust,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.800]   but that was our way forward.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.280]   And it kept us from speaking about details of our problems
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.400]   with just random people.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   We trusted each other with those we had agreed upon.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.040]   So that's a possible way forward, perhaps.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.960]   Fourth, I would encourage this wife to recognize
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.640]   that very likely part of what she is experiencing
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.720]   in her husband's harshness is owing to sin,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.120]   part owing to sin.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.280]   And part of it is probably owing to the,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.120]   what should we call it?
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.440]   The inherited genetic tendencies
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.720]   embedded in his own basic personality
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.240]   or in his upbringing.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.520]   Now, I'm not excusing any sin by saying this,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.280]   but I am being realistic
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   and acknowledging how complicated human beings are.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.020]   I know people whose personality is such
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.560]   that you wish they would smile more.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.440]   You wish that they would oil the relational wheels
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.600]   with a few more kind words
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   or forthcoming encouragements or affirmations,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   but instead there's almost continual bluntness,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.840]   terseness, unemotional communication.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.360]   And I have learned over the decades
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.200]   that in certain cases, this is simply not sinful.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.120]   This is a deeply ingrained personality trait
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.920]   with no ill will.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.400]   There's no ill will behind it.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.880]   You know this over time.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.720]   And it will only make matters worse
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.680]   if the people around these folks
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.760]   continually impute sin to them,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.240]   where in fact that's not mainly what's going on.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.600]   Finally, last point.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.760]   When it comes to actual approaching the husband,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.620]   here are a few thoughts about how to go about that.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.620]   It is perfectly biblical, as you can see
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.640]   from the way Paul approaches the problem,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.760]   say in 1 Corinthians,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.880]   to find explicit things that you can say
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.140]   by way of thankfulness and encouragement and affirmation.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.960]   Call them evidences of God's grace
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.320]   that you see in his life
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.820]   so that criticisms, when they come,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.540]   are embedded in a rich context
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.940]   of love and verbal affirmation.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.180]   In the overall context of your relationship then,
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.100]   ask him from time to time, perhaps also,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.720]   is there anything that your own behavior
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.340]   or your own attitudes are bothersome to him
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.940]   or frustrating to him or maddening to him
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.160]   or annoying to him,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.280]   and ask him to point out any ways
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.240]   that he would like you to make changes.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.960]   So I'm saying this in the larger, bigger context,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.480]   no artificial way of,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.140]   okay, here are three affirmations I'm gonna make
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.780]   and three vulnerabilities I'm gonna express,
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.680]   and now here comes my criticism.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.720]   It's just a bigger, healthy relationship
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.620]   that you try to build so that when you broach a problem,
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.040]   it's not part of an ugly pattern.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.200]   When you try to describe to him
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.980]   what you mean by his harshness,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.700]   try not to globalize.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.300]   This is something I had to learn about myself
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.140]   in dealing with my wife.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.620]   Try not to globalize.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.620]   That is, instead of saying, "You always do this."
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.620]   You're always saying it that way.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.100]   You always do it that way.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   I can tell you, human beings do not like the word always.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.540]   I mean, if you wanna push somebody away,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.460]   make it sound like this criticism is global.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.820]   It's all-consuming.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.320]   That's all you are, the human being.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.260]   Because what that says to the other person is,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.220]   there's no hope for you,
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.000]   that they will feel paralyzed and helpless.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So instead, you give one or two concrete examples
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.800]   that you wish they did another way,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.880]   a different tone of voice or a different way of answering.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.100]   And that gives them some sense,
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.240]   okay, I get that, I get that.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.920]   I can see how you would hear that.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   I'll try not to do that anymore.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.480]   And incrementally then,
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.100]   who knows how God might be pleased to work.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.880]   And then finally, I would say,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   if he indicates a sense of openness to talk about this,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.280]   then you can explain your feelings more fully.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.920]   You can ask for what you long for
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.400]   and maybe explain why it would be so happy
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.260]   for the relationship if he would be less harsh
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.840]   in these several ways.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.200]   And if you both feel stuck after a while,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.240]   it is perfectly biblical and right
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   to seek help from close friends
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.180]   or even if it comes to that from a wise Christian counselor.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.880]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.520]   We have dozens of episodes in the archive now
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   on marriage struggles.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.840]   You can search for them and find them
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.880]   in our growing archive,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   which you can find online at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.540]   or you can just type in askpastorjohn.com
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.040]   and that'll get you there as well.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.080]   We start next week talking about prayer.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.520]   Sometimes we say that we are wrestling in prayer
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   for something.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   There are others use that phrase wrestling in prayer
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.840]   and that phrase wrestling in prayer is a biblical one,
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.400]   one used by Paul in the book of Colossians,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.840]   but it only appears one time.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.520]   So what does it mean biblically speaking
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.200]   to wrestle in prayer?
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.040]   That's up next.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.860]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.520]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.560]   Have a great weekend.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
