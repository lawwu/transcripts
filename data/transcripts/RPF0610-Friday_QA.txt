[00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.580]   The end of the day, I'm going to be talking about the best philosophy of hard, strong, focused academics, and then the rest of the time be filled with many diverse experiences, many diverse exposures, diverse work, diverse business activities, diverse individual pursuits, diverse hobbies, etc. And that seems to me to be the best philosophy to create a comprehensive whole person who does do well in academics, but also is not maintains their diverse interests. So that's, that's my current approach.

I really appreciate it. I've come across most of Mr. Gatto's work so far, and I don't think there was a podcast that presented some of his work as well. What other books have influenced you in the tree garden, just off the top of your head?

[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:45.620]   So first, my experience and my observation and my recommendation to you is when you are expecting a baby, I would encourage you to essentially hit pause on any big decisions. There are a couple of reasons for that. This is your first child, is that correct?
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:46:09.860]   So we have a foster child who we likely will adopt in the next year or so. But yeah, this will be our first biological child.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:09.960]   Okay, great.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.060]   So and that's also if you are fostering and looking towards adoption, that's also kind of the same advice applies.

So I am in the, I'm not your best resource, but I'll try to point you in the right direction by at least asking a couple of hopefully helpful questions. So to be clear, you currently have a mainstream health insurance program, right? Mm hmm. That's correct. And the two things that you mentioned, you said starting a potentially an HSA, a health, a healthcare sharing account, or you mentioned the idea of moving to a Christian ministry.

[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:20.720]   a medical sharing plan. Those are two very different things. So you could just simply add an HSA account onto your current plans. If your current plans offer you a high deductible health plan for you to move to a medical sharing plan using Christian healthcare sharing ministry, that would be a very different move and a very big move. So those are very, those are two big different questions on it. Is there any reason why you think you shouldn't just go ahead and add the HSA? Is there any downside to the HSA?

I'm not good enough, but hopefully maybe there'll be a listener who knows something about it and can get in touch with me. And if so, I'll forward the info on to you. Tell me an email. Do that.

But it's an interesting idea and I appreciate your doing a good job. Employees really do value medical programs, especially the appropriate caliber of employees. I hate how ridiculous the marketplace has gotten. Unfortunately, I don't have a solution. I don't see how it can be solved in the short term.
