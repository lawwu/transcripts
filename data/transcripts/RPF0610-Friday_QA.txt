[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Holiday shopping is so stressful.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.440]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.560]   Blendjet is the perfect gift for everyone on your list.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.280]   Blendjet?
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.960]   It's the portable blender that lets you make smoothies and shakes anywhere.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400]   That sounds amazing.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.840]   But what about the price?
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.040]   That's the best part.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.720]   Blendjet's Black Friday sale is going on right now.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.680]   It's their lowest price ever.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.600]   I'm sold.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.680]   Where do I get it?

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.880]   But you've got to hurry.

[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.840]   Blendjet.com.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's live Q&A.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:52.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.040]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.600]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today we do live Q&A.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960]   And in general, these shows are supposed to be scheduled for Friday, but...
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.480]   Wait about 10 seconds for the music to catch up,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.520]   and I'll have a special announcement of how you can join me next week.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:24.600]   I have restricted these shows to patrons of the show.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.640]   That helps me to meter the calls that come in just a little bit.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.920]   So I open these Friday Q&A shows up to everybody who supports the show
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.320]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.000]   But obviously, as I have been traveling,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.160]   one of the challenges has been figuring out how to record these shows,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.720]   and that is entirely my fault.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   I have done my best, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to keep to a strict weekly show.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   Sorry, a strict weekly schedule.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.640]   And so this coming week, which will be the week of...
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.880]   December 17th?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.160]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, each day this coming week,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.520]   I will be releasing a live Q&A show.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   So I'm going to give you instructions on how you can join that show.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.480]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   I'm going to be recording a live Q&A show.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.600]   I will not necessarily release them five in a row.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.040]   I have a number of other shows that I want to get to next week,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   but I will be recording them live each day,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   and then we'll be releasing them over the next couple of weeks.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.760]   So if you would like to join for a Friday Q&A show,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.480]   and if you are not a patron of the show,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.800]   this will be your opportunity to join me for a total of potentially five shows.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.160]   So here are the instructions.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.920]   Each day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.960]   starting on the 17th, December 17th,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   you can join me at noon Eastern time at 561-440-7362.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.680]   That's what you need.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.600]   Call in at 12 noon Eastern time at 561-440-7362.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   Each day from December 17th through whatever that Friday is,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.720]   I would say, I guess the December 22nd.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.400]   561-440-7362.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.320]   That will be your best chance if you'd like to join me for a Q&A show.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.280]   And then in the future, then this will, of course,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.240]   revert back to patrons only as all of the callers on today's show are.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.440]   So I'd love for you to join me for that special series of Q&A shows.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   You can call up and talk to me about anything that you would like,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.440]   any question, any comment, anything related to current topics on the show.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.960]   Feel free to join in and call in for those series of shows,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.480]   and your question will be released on the show.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   We begin with Anne in Maryland.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.480]   Anne, welcome to the show.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.560]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.400]   I really enjoyed your asset protection for the immortals series.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.640]   And I also want to say that I bought both of your courses for credit card
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.440]   and then for career income.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.720]   And I really like them.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.240]   And so I just want to pass three ideas for the courses.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.200]   I think if you had a course on asset protection with a little bit more
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.080]   detail of maybe with links to different states, maybe with some ideas.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.680]   It doesn't need to be extensive, but some people who can click on the links
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.880]   and go and find the information.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.240]   And then maybe also an insurance course.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.560]   I personally have a question about that today.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.920]   But I am sure there are many people who have no idea about life and disability
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.960]   insurances and introduction to basics and where to start and dig deeper
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.640]   would be great.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.160]   And on trust, I hear you talk a lot about trust.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.960]   I know about their existence, but I wouldn't know where to start with those.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.440]   So these are just ideas to add to, I'm sure, your very long list of ideas
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   for courses for you.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.200]   So I have two questions, actually two topics and quite quick questions on each.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.000]   So the first topic is on asset protection.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.440]   And I have three questions.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.840]   And I can repeat them if you forget which one.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.600]   So it so happens that I and my husband move quite frequently
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.520]   compared to the majority of people.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.920]   So I keep an eye on the state and different states.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.560]   Sometimes we have a choice of a state.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.800]   Sometimes we don't.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   But what I would like to confirm with you first
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.400]   is whether in general, if you move from one state to another,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   you're essentially starting over with the asset protection plan
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.640]   unless that the new state is very similar to the previous one
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.080]   in terms of asset protection rules.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.880]   Is that your understanding?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   Yeah, in a way.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.440]   And so that's a difficult question because it would involve
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.040]   a number of different factors.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.440]   And if your estate and your affairs are very significant,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.040]   that would be one where you would want to get specific legal counsel.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.600]   I'll give you what my understanding is
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.000]   of kind of the broad picture.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.320]   But that's one where you would want to get specific legal counsel
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   as it relates to your state because there are a couple
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.240]   of important issues involved.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.480]   Just to be clear, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.120]   I'm very interested in law.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   But I do not consider myself a lawyer.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.800]   I just consider myself a little bit more
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.640]   capable than most people of reading books by lawyers
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.080]   and then interpreting them into a little bit more
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   of a practical situation.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   But I get stuff wrong.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.080]   And so if I bungle the stuff in today's show,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.680]   then go and speak to a lawyer.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.640]   So the first thing that you want to be clear on
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.520]   is what is your domicile?
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.200]   What is the state where you are domiciled?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.720]   And depending on how your affairs are set up
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   and what your actual moves look like, then you
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.800]   have to figure out how the law will apply to your situation.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.920]   Now, often when this type of planning comes in,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   you look at where your assets are located.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.520]   So the best example, down here in Florida,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.880]   we have a lot of people from the Northeast
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.920]   who moved down and retired down here.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   So from New York, New Jersey, all
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   of the Northeastern states.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.000]   But frequently what people will do
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.440]   is they will retain some of their property in the Northeast.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.120]   And they'll also start to acquire property in Florida.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.720]   Now, one of the big benefits of Florida
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.800]   is, of course, the lack of a state income tax.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.360]   And so many people want to change their residence
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.880]   to Florida, but they don't want to get rid of their estate
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.520]   in New York.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.280]   They want to keep their nice house in Connecticut or New
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.840]   York.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.360]   They want to keep their affairs there,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.960]   but they also want to switch their state down to Florida
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.720]   so they can escape the state income tax.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.440]   In addition, when planning for estate taxes--
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.480]   and this has really minimized a lot in the last few years--
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   what most people don't recognize is how burdensome estate taxes
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.060]   used to be.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.680]   It used to be that if you had an estate as small as several
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.000]   hundreds of thousands of dollars at one point,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.280]   then anything above-- any value of property
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.660]   that you owned above those several hundreds of thousands
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.160]   of dollars was subject to an estate tax rate of perhaps 50%
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   of the assets.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.560]   And so that brought many, many thousands--
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.000]   hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people--
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.400]   in under the purview of estate tax planning.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.200]   And that was a real challenge for people
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   because they weren't used to thinking about it.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   Whereas now, with a $5.5 million estate tax exemption
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.720]   amount for any individual, $11 million for married couples,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.120]   there's a much smaller percentage
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.000]   of the population that has to think about estate taxes.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   So the reason I say that is if you can imagine for a moment
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.960]   when you had a house in New York state and a house in Florida
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.880]   and then some additional business
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.320]   interests, some additional investments,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.400]   you would find yourself with a very mixed up situation.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.160]   And you would probably find yourself paying estate taxes
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.720]   in the state of New York and then also in Florida.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.920]   And if you can imagine you had $10 million of assets
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.120]   and you had even a $1 million exemption amount,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.640]   the estate taxes on those $9 million
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.840]   were very significant, even the state level estate taxes.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.800]   So one of your biggest issues is how
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.220]   do you establish your domicile?
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.880]   How do you move your domicile?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   And you may still be taxed on the value of the estate
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.440]   in New York.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.160]   But if you can keep your New York estate subject solely
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.840]   down to the amount of property that you own in New York
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.040]   and the rest of your estate can be moved to Florida,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.480]   then that's going to be successful.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.940]   But now we have to ask the question,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.280]   how do you establish domicile in a state?
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.040]   And here, every state is different
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.360]   in terms of what they allow and what they don't allow.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.160]   So the worst state, from my understanding,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.560]   is the state of California.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.520]   If you spend almost any time in the state of California,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.980]   the state of California wants to get their claws into you,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.160]   their taxing claws with income taxes
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.840]   and then whatever other taxes are applicable to you.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.120]   And so you can't just-- if you live in California
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.160]   and you want to say, I'm going to move to Nevada,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.680]   you can't just move and buy a house in Nevada
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.160]   and think that that fixes everything.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.040]   You have to systematically cut off
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   all or most of your ties from California
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.920]   and move those ties over to the state of Nevada.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.480]   So one of the most valuable things
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.640]   that you can do in your analysis is look at your assets
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.400]   and try to think about where those assets are located.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.120]   And each state you move to, you'll
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.520]   need to figure out if you should move assets
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.360]   or if you shouldn't and what your actual situation is.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.840]   Now, it may be possible for you to establish
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.560]   your domicile in one place and to keep
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.720]   that domicile in that one place, even if you're not specifically
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.200]   living there all the time.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.560]   If your travel and your movement is more short-term in basis,
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.960]   perhaps you're just moving for a short-term contract,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.720]   six months here, six months there.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.840]   In that case, I think you can make a very good case
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.200]   that you can just simply set up your domicile
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.640]   in one specific place and then make sure
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.280]   that you adjust your lifestyle in a way that remains clearly
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.320]   your domicile.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.000]   So for example, if I ever had to do anything
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.280]   in the state of California, I would work very diligently
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.320]   to completely stay out of the state
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.000]   and keep everything possible out of the state.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   So I would make sure--
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.680]   and just to be clear, this is a little bit of a muddled area
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.600]   because it's not just one factor.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.160]   You can't have a Nevada driver's license
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.400]   and register to vote in Nevada, but then
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.120]   have California bank accounts, a California house that you own.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.560]   All your vehicles are registered in California.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.480]   Your banking statements go to California.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.400]   You go to doctor's appointments in California.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.800]   You go to church in California.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.040]   You can't say, OK, well, then I'm not a California resident.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   You would clearly lose that case.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.880]   You are, in that case, a California resident.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.480]   But if you have all of your affairs established
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.800]   in one particular place, you have a house in Nevada--
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   and I'm just using that because it's the most--
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   California is the strongest in terms
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.920]   of their pursuit of taxation.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.240]   And you have the very clear line between California and Nevada
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.600]   in terms of a very clear difference of legal system.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.220]   So if you have a house in Nevada,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.240]   if you have a driver's license in Nevada,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.040]   if you register to vote in Nevada,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.600]   if all your vehicles are registered in Nevada,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.880]   if all of your banking records are sent to your billing
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.720]   addresses in Nevada, if all of your bank accounts
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.040]   are with Nevada banks, if you go to visit doctors and dentists
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.400]   and to professional business organizations in Nevada,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.000]   if you volunteer locally in Nevada,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.520]   if you're part of a church in Nevada,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.280]   if you go to your country club in Nevada,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.080]   if everything you do is in Nevada,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.280]   but then on occasion you travel to California,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.400]   then California cannot make the claim
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:25.040]   that all of your assets are subject to their tax system.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.560]   Now, they can make the claim that any income that you earn
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.640]   in the state of California will be California-sourced income,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.800]   and you would owe California income tax on that basis.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.480]   Now, back to your situation.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.080]   What I would pursue if I were you
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.400]   is I would look carefully at my affairs,
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.600]   and I would look to see if I could establish my domicile
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.120]   in one place in a state that I know,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.680]   and then simply treat my moves or my traveling contracts
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.600]   as temporary contracts.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.680]   So the last five months, I've been traveling
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   around the United States with my family, but I didn't move.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.240]   Everything is in Florida, so my Florida will under Florida law
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.200]   is still in force.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.520]   All of my trusts under Florida law are all still in force,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   and I intentionally am going to be very careful and clear
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.360]   about not setting up a domicile or not even giving indication
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.840]   of moving somewhere outside of Florida
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.560]   because that would systematically change
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.360]   everything in my affairs.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.960]   So that's my advice to you is look to see if you can do that.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.320]   If you can't do that, if you're actually
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.480]   moving every three years, and if you're not
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.240]   willing to establish your affairs in one state,
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.520]   work with a bank in one state, spend your time in one state,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.200]   and establish that state as your clear domicile,
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.080]   and rather you're just going to simply move,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.560]   then yes, every three years when you move states,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   you would need to take a careful look at what accounts are
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.040]   protected or not protected.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.680]   You would need to update your will
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.480]   and make sure that if you have anything fancy or special,
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.080]   you would need to make sure that it's
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.880]   valid under the laws of that state.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.920]   And so in that case, if that's your situation,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.960]   your only answer is to simplify your affairs.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.760]   So that-- well, not your only answer,
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.560]   but my recommendation would be to simplify your affairs
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.360]   and focus on planning that would be applicable in all states.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.280]   So for example, in the series that we did,
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.160]   I made it clear that 401(k) accounts or other qualified
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.200]   plans are protected from an asset protection
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.000]   standpoint in every state because that's
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.840]   governed under federal law.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.400]   Now, your IRA depends on state law.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.800]   Your life insurance protection depends on state law.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.720]   But you would be well-suited to carefully focus
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.520]   on your planning that would be protected in every state.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   And then when we move to things like trusts,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.560]   for example, domestic asset protection trusts
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.440]   are increasing in popularity.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.840]   But my understanding of--
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.560]   for clear, asset protections trust
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.040]   that's built and governed under the law of several United
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.540]   States.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.520]   The problem with domestic asset protection trusts
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.880]   is in general, there's no US law that
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.680]   protects a self-settled trust from the claims creditors,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.200]   which is what a domestic asset protection trust is.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.640]   Now, there are, I think, about 13 states--
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.220]   I could be wrong on that number, but I
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.240]   think about 13 states whose laws have been updated and reflected
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.600]   to say, hey, we're going to protect a self-settled trust
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.880]   based upon this specific law that has
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.520]   been passed in about 13 states.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.560]   But there's a debate that happens among attorneys,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.440]   whether, number one, whether it's accurate,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.360]   or whether that only protects the assets that
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.040]   are held in those 13 states.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.840]   So if you live in one of those states
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.120]   and you have all of your assets in one of those states,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.680]   and if your trust is in that state, then maybe it works.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.760]   But in your case, that kind of thing doesn't work.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.340]   So then if you need a trust, you need
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.200]   to look at something that's completely
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.560]   outside of US jurisdiction.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.140]   You would go offshore with your trust,
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.360]   and you would set up an offshore trust, which
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.800]   would be applicable under each state,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   because you're completely removing those assets
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.680]   from outside from US jurisdiction.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.440]   So that was an extensive answer, but did
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.000]   that get at the heart of your question
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.080]   and give you some thoughts to consider?
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.040]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.120]   I think that's extremely valuable.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.160]   I just have a couple of comments.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.280]   When I started to research my state and the states
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.520]   that I know I may move to, and I noticed
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.320]   that laws change in state.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.960]   And I have a question for you.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.120]   From your research and experience,
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.960]   how frequently do you see laws change in each state?
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.520]   It seems like you may have a plan for asset protection.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   You may stay in the state of Florida,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.000]   for example, in your case, but in any other state
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.640]   for another person's case.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.400]   And then let's say in five years, they change law,
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.480]   and now it's completely different.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.880]   How frequent is it that the laws change,
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:50.280]   and maybe to the detriment of asset protection situation?
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.320]   - I'm not knowledgeable enough to give a specific answer
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.960]   to that, and so let me give you a couple of different ways
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   to think about it from my observation.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.920]   In general, it seems that there will
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.800]   be a culture in a specific state that is reflected
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.360]   in the laws of that state.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.920]   And unless there's something happening culturally
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.960]   in the state that's going to change that,
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.400]   then the laws are going to follow along
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.680]   a systematic legal theory.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.000]   So I'm most familiar with Florida law,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.440]   so let me speak to that.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.520]   In Florida, in the Florida Constitution,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.560]   there is a culture of protection of assets
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.400]   that has been codified.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   It's codified in the Florida Constitution.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.800]   The Homestead Exemption example, it's
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.040]   codified in the Constitution.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.200]   And that culture is then reflected
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.640]   in the interpretations of the courts of that law.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   So an example would be the most famous thing
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.160]   about the Florida Homestead Exemption
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   is what I've mentioned on the show several times,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.720]   that even if you buy a Florida homestead
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.080]   with fraudulent intent, then you are still protected
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.240]   under the state of Florida.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.400]   Well, that specific law was based upon a case
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.280]   that was heard before the US Supreme Court,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   and that case was interpreted based upon the codified law
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   in the Constitution.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.360]   So the US Supreme Court studied the case.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.400]   The facts of the case very clearly indicated
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   that somebody had purchased real estate
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.880]   with the intent to defraud their creditors,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.760]   but they interpreted the Florida Constitution
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.160]   under the intent, or what they interpreted
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.360]   as to be the intent of the legislators,
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.880]   which was to provide virtually an absolute protection
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   for a Florida homestead with the exception of the exceptions
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.800]   that are specifically listed in the Florida Constitution.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.200]   Now, that law is not going to change anytime soon.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.880]   It's constitutional, and it's been interpreted,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.120]   the precedents have been set in the common law rulings
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.640]   of the various courts.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.400]   And all of the precedents in the state of Florida
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.720]   that would be drawn on for most asset protection lawsuits
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.960]   basically are on the favor of protecting the assets.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.920]   The same thing happened when Florida looked
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.440]   at the protection for retirement accounts.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.560]   So there was this big question of, are IRAs and Roth IRAs
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.520]   protected from the claims of creditors?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.400]   And perhaps a Florida attorney would,
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.920]   I think I'm right in this understanding,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.680]   but what happened was the case went forward with it,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.240]   and it was starting to be interpreted by the courts,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.300]   but the Florida legislature actually came along
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.760]   and clarified the issue and said,
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.600]   yes, we protect IRAs and Roth IRAs
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.300]   because that's in line with the philosophy of this state.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.680]   Now, let's flip it around and pick on a different state.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.520]   A different state will have a very different culture
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.760]   of protection of those assets,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.960]   and you can't change that culture overnight.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   So a state like California has an entrenched culture
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.840]   of taxation and of minimal protections for assets.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.680]   So California doesn't allow tenancy by the entirety.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   So all of the titling,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.400]   which we haven't talked about in the series yet,
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.680]   is not available.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.880]   Tenancy by the entirety protections
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.040]   is not available in California.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.240]   It is in Florida.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.480]   California has a very limited homestead exemption,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.960]   50 to 50 or $75,000 for a single person or family,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.400]   up to $150,000 if somebody's older.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.440]   That's very different than the unlimited protections
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.660]   in Texas and Florida.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.640]   California doesn't protect IRA assets.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.380]   California doesn't protect Roth IRA assets.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.940]   California doesn't protect life insurance cash values
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.320]   beyond about $10,000 for an individual,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.020]   $20,000 for a couple.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.860]   You can go on.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.880]   California doesn't protect college savings plans
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.320]   like a state like Florida does.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.160]   So you can foil those states.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.760]   You can compare them one to the other,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.380]   and you can see there is a very entrenched culture
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.760]   in one state versus another state.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.160]   Now, the specific application of the law will change
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.200]   as more court rulings are found,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.000]   as a particular technique is tested in a court.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.880]   But the general culture of a state,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.360]   the general legal culture and the precedent,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.480]   the common law precedent for each state
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.040]   is unlikely to change very much.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.520]   So my answer is, in general,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.080]   the specifics of the law might change a little bit.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.300]   One type of trust may be defeated in court,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.600]   and so the attorneys would stop using that type of trust
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.640]   to move somewhere else.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.800]   But the general theory will hold true
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.480]   in a long series of cases,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   depending on the culture of a state.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.800]   And the same thing applies internationally, by the way.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.500]   Exactly the same thing applies internationally.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.560]   So there are many jurisdictions
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.160]   that are used very favorably for different perspectives,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.120]   whether it's banking or tax planning
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.680]   or asset protection planning,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.120]   and a jurisdiction sets up its laws in a certain way,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.040]   and then an attorney analyzes those laws
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.600]   and says, "These laws are favorable,"
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.100]   and that jurisdiction then continues
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.520]   over a long period of time to maintain that same culture.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.480]   So from that perspective, it's fairly stable.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.520]   - That's very clear.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.800]   Now I know where to go and look and have an idea.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.360]   Two very quick questions.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.980]   I also noticed that sometimes it says
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.800]   that a state opted out of federal statutes and regulations.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.320]   I understand there is lots of nuances there, probably,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.120]   but is it possible that the state will say,
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.760]   "Well, we don't care that federal laws
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.600]   protect 401(k)s, we will opt out"?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.120]   - It's not that way.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.960]   So specifically, in each state,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.280]   a state has to decide what laws it's going to use
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.120]   in its state to govern bankruptcy,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.400]   and they have a choice.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.420]   They can just adopt the federal bankruptcy code,
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.760]   the federal bankruptcy exemptions, and many states do that.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.280]   So you can read the federal code,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.000]   and you can look, and some states will say,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.400]   "We'll just go along with the federal code."
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.160]   Or the state can adopt a different state-specific code.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.840]   So that's what Florida has done,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.960]   is they have adopted their own specific code.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.800]   Now, here, there's a difference between bankruptcy law
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.320]   and asset protection law.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.600]   They are close together, so that's why I recommend
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.840]   you can study the bankruptcy exemptions
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.700]   and understand a little bit about asset protection,
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.480]   but they are not equivalent.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.020]   But it doesn't mean that a state can willy-nilly just say,
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.320]   "Hey, that's it, we're gonna change our laws."
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.260]   That process happens slowly.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.280]   It's just simply a matter of, has the state chosen
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.540]   to perfectly mirror and simply adopt
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.440]   the federal bankruptcy code, or have they chosen
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.540]   to institute their own version of that?
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.480]   Now, remember, bankruptcy court is federal,
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.280]   and so it's not clear to me at the moment.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.140]   I'm not competent enough to explain
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.240]   all of the legal theory there.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.600]   That would be a question for a bankruptcy attorney.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.160]   But that's what's happening.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.500]   So it's not just that a state is saying,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.000]   "Oh, we're gonna just change this one thing willy-nilly."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.400]   You can trust the stability of whether a state
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.560]   has opted in or opted out, and you can trust that state
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.260]   to be fairly stable going forward.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.780]   - And I don't wanna take more of your time.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.780]   Just to confirm, I'm reading that 403(b) and 457,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.060]   well, 457, I don't know, but I assume it's the same,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   but I'm reading it as 403(b) is under the state regulation,
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.240]   not federal.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.040]   If that's what you're reading, I don't know.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.000]   - I think I saw it either on the IRS website
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.840]   or somewhere on the federal website,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.960]   and I was surprised 'cause I usually treat 401(k)s
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.200]   and 403(b)s quite similar.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.580]   I know they're a little bit different,
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.160]   but in general, similar.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.560]   And then I saw that academic institutions
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   that provide 403(b)s are not protected by federal law.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.840]   But I can double check.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.960]   - I'm not, I can't answer that question
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.240]   on the top of my head without specifically looking at it
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.080]   in research.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.920]   I didn't prepare that in my preparation
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.360]   for the Asset Protection Series,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.220]   so I would personally need to research that to answer it.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.880]   But I would just say the best thing is, yes, read,
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.120]   but the most important thing is to get advice
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.320]   on your specific situation from your specific state.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   Because even if a certain account type is protected
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.600]   in some way or not protected in some way,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.800]   a good attorney who's familiar with your state law
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.360]   will know how to get the maximum protection
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.320]   for each particular account type.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.680]   And that's beyond my ability to interpret state by state.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.920]   And I'm gonna put you on hold and come back to you
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.500]   if we have time at the end,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.240]   but let's get some other callers and then we'll come back
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.120]   'cause I know you had another line of questions
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.980]   that you wanted to pursue,
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.760]   but we'll move on here for a moment.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.080]   We go down to Nathan in Florida.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.920]   Welcome to the show.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.880]   How can I serve you today, Nathan?
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.520]   - Hi, good afternoon.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.520]   So I wanted to thank you for all these long format podcasts
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.760]   you came out with over the previous few years.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   I recently finished my medical training in Chicago
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.320]   and I had a long commute for a multi-medical school
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.840]   in residency, so you really helped me
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.400]   sort through a lot of financial life issues
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   during that commute.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.320]   So recently, my family and I moved from Chicago
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.600]   down to central Florida and we have a one-year-old now.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.440]   So I've been going through a lot of your podcasts
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.560]   about your educational philosophy
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.480]   and how it's changed over the years.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   And one of the other things that I recently
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.640]   was your podcast in 1999 about your vision
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.840]   and plans for your child's primary and secondary education.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.760]   And I believe that was published more than four years ago.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.560]   So I'm just wondering how your thoughts have changed
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.880]   over the past four years.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.040]   - What a good question.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   So what I try to do in any kind of public comment
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.120]   is provide a little bit of creative fodder
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.160]   of ideas that individual parents can consider
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.080]   that might be different than the mainstream.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.280]   And I don't publicly advocate for one certain approach
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.240]   versus another, because that would violate
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.160]   what I think is important, which is a personalized approach
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.800]   that's appropriate for each child.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.200]   The only thing I'm rather vociferous about
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.240]   is simply opting out of the government system,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.360]   which is almost by definition,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.600]   with the exception of the teachers
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.480]   who try to individualize it,
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   tries to fit children into one specific system
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.080]   that doesn't serve most children.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.960]   The most cognitively capable children
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.520]   seem to do well in that system,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.400]   but it doesn't serve most children.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.760]   So in my own personal life,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.720]   I also have recognized and experienced,
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.440]   and I don't talk much about this stuff publicly
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   'cause my show is not an education podcast,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   but you have to look at the individual situation
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.920]   in your life, the individual skills, interests,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.160]   abilities that you have,
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.120]   the financial capabilities that you have,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   and then compare that to the specific child.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   And the most important thing is to expect in time
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.200]   that things will change.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.240]   So I'll give you an example of something
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.680]   that has changed for me.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.320]   I did a show a long time ago
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.760]   where I talked about the teach your baby to read proponents.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.360]   And there are a number of authors
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.160]   who are very focused on teaching babies
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.120]   who are not yet verbal to read
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.920]   and at a very extremely young age.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.160]   Now, I've read a number of books
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.000]   and it's important to note
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.960]   that it's a very controversial subject.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   Many people think, hey, this is all bunk.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   I don't think it's bunk,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.680]   but I recognize that it's a controversial thing.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.000]   But it was very attractive to me at that time,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.120]   especially when my wife and I had one child.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.640]   Well, we have more than one child now.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.920]   And so our family circumstances have changed.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.360]   So even if I wanted to engage
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.680]   in the teach your baby to read philosophy,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.520]   we're no longer capable of doing it
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.320]   without that being a controlling factor in our life
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.520]   or without my wife and I
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.680]   being extraordinarily motivated and dedicated, and we're not.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.360]   I haven't seen any very convincing evidence
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.200]   that that's the most important thing.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.240]   So I've changed on that perspective.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.040]   I've changed my opinion
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   just simply due to life circumstances.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.920]   And I'm leading with this because first,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.680]   it's the thing I worry most about.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.840]   As a public commentator,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.680]   which is, I guess at this point, it's not particularly new,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.000]   but I've chosen to try to be clear
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.340]   and to make clear statements.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.180]   But when you do that,
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.840]   you run the risk of being misunderstood.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.120]   And I have just made the decision
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.160]   to hope that my audience is mature enough
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.920]   to make personal application to their own life.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   But there are times in your life
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.080]   where you will have to change.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.720]   So for example, even though I'm extraordinarily dogmatic
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.880]   against government education systems,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.400]   that doesn't mean that I couldn't create scenarios
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.160]   in my life or that I haven't been in scenarios
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.440]   with other people where the best thing to do
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.280]   is to put your children into the government schools.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.320]   I've been in government schools.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.440]   When I was younger, my sister died.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.600]   And one of the things that happened
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.760]   after the death of my sister,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.840]   she had an epileptic seizure
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.440]   when she was a teenager and died.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.500]   One of the things that happened
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.720]   is I was put into a government school for a time.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.760]   Now, I look at that
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.960]   and it was exactly the right thing to do at the time.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.640]   And I can imagine many circumstances
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.360]   in which that's the best thing to do.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.920]   So I think it's important that parents always keep in mind
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.800]   that we're looking to see what is happening,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.760]   what are the results?
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.360]   And those results need to be,
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.440]   what are the results for the child?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.640]   And those results need to be,
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.640]   what are the results for the parents?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.020]   Because no matter if you have the perfect system
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.160]   that you think is the world's greatest educational system,
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.360]   but if it destroys your family life
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.200]   or it destroys the child's life, it's not.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.240]   It's not the perfect system for you.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.280]   So the normal course of action
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.800]   from most people who are engaging with their children
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.120]   and who are working with them
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.240]   is they'll choose some place to start,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.080]   something that interests them,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.640]   and then that's philosophy will change.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.540]   My eldest at this point in time
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.760]   is just in the kindergarten type years.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.200]   Now he's academically substantially ahead
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.920]   of perhaps some of his peers, but he's behind others.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.760]   But it doesn't matter because my job
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.960]   is to look and to see what's working for him.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.880]   And even in our recent travels, in the beginning of that,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.120]   we focused on academics,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.600]   but then it came a point on our trip
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.440]   where the academics just weren't working.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.600]   They weren't working for the child
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.880]   and they weren't working for my wife.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.040]   And so we just canceled, canceled all of it
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.520]   and said, that's it for now, we're not going to do it.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   And that's the ability, the precious gift
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.260]   that parents have when they take control
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.540]   is they can look to see what's working,
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.940]   they can change things based upon
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.900]   what's working with the child.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.780]   So I'll tell you right now my working philosophy,
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.620]   which is your question,
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.020]   but I feel like I should add that preamble,
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.900]   especially when I bring such,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.560]   for a time I aired such dogmatic presentations
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.140]   like John Taylor Gatto's work and things like that.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.300]   It's important to always listen to what somebody says,
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.100]   consider it, but then interpret it for your own situation.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.680]   So here are a few things that I believe are important.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   Number one, I believe that academics are important
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.920]   if a child, especially for a child
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.780]   who is cognitively capable,
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.020]   a child who has a high cognitive ability,
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.620]   I believe that academics are important.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.340]   In our modern society,
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.300]   academics are an important part
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.840]   of functioning well within the society.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.300]   The priests and priestesses in our society
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.340]   are all in the academy and in the extensions of the academy.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.420]   And so it's important to recognize
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.340]   that if you're going to be a person of influence,
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.060]   you're going to at least have to figure out
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.500]   how to work within that system of academics.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.020]   And I see no reason to not encourage a child
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.420]   who is capable to function well
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.560]   at a high point in academics.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.540]   For me, it's also very important to note
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.660]   that academics, in my opinion, are not ultimate.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.540]   There are a lot of academics who see themselves
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.100]   as God's gift to mankind or the magical,
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.220]   let's use a non-theistic interpretation,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   an accidental mixture of organic material
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.620]   that has come together that has created
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.820]   an accidental gift to mankind of knowledge and insight.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.340]   There are many academics who believe that that's ultimate,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.740]   and I don't see it as ultimate.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.700]   I don't think that that's ultimately important.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.820]   And so it seems to me that that should be reflected
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.400]   in the lives of our children.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.600]   With an excessive focus on academics,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.220]   it's easy to create very boring children
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.460]   who simply come out and they look like everyone else,
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.580]   and they don't have much depth or much interest
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.020]   or much texture to their lives.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.180]   And so I look at character development
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.380]   as being very important.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.220]   That's the cornerstone of success
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.300]   is character development, in my opinion.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.660]   And academics can be used as a tool in that,
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.060]   but it's not necessarily the most effective tool.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.700]   In addition, then, I look at education.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.060]   I say education needs to involve good social training
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.900]   so that a child can work effectively in the society.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.060]   And then education needs to involve good business training.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.520]   And so those are kind of a few basic themes.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.580]   And at the moment, what I look at,
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.060]   I'm torn between an extreme focus on academics,
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.780]   like I'm the kind of person as an extremist,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.620]   I'm the kind of person who would be
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.660]   in the direction of saying,
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.260]   we've got to be academically excellent in everything.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.000]   So I run in that bent,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.060]   but then I look at the arguments of the unschoolers
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.800]   and the people who talk about
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.460]   the importance of natural interest,
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.120]   and I find those arguments persuasive as well.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.580]   And so at the moment, my operating philosophy is
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.700]   you can focus on just a simple core discipline
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   of excellence in reading, writing, and arithmetic,
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.460]   and then everything else can basically fit in
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.980]   based upon the interests of the child.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.700]   And then what I like the idea of is,
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.380]   arithmetic is interesting because it's its own language,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.620]   it's its own discipline.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.940]   And although there is application to everything in life,
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.580]   it's one of those things that
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.900]   I don't see how it can be learned
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.460]   except by consistent effort.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.360]   And so to me, that seems the best point
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.820]   for character development.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.780]   But reading and writing are skills that can be developed
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.380]   with a careful focus on the child's particular interests.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.340]   And so the reading, I think a child needs to read
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   a comprehensive library that has been developed
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.820]   with good attention on all of the areas that are important,
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.940]   but then the outlets for writing can be customized
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.380]   to the child based upon their interest
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.180]   to maintain a high degree of interest.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.420]   So that's my current philosophy,
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.620]   and my wife and I are just working through it
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.980]   and constantly analyzing it to see,
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.700]   is this working well,
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.920]   and is this working well in the life of the child?
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.080]   To me, the biggest thing is that academics in childhood
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.140]   should not be all consuming,
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.040]   neither should play or simply,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.860]   and by play, let me differentiate between creative play
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.600]   and a kind of stultifying mindless entertainment.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.800]   So I don't like the idea,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.700]   you go to the Asian model and school children in Singapore,
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.940]   I don't think it's good for children
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.800]   to spend 10 hours a day just doing academics.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.080]   So to me, it seems like a good fit
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.900]   is to have a few hours a day, perhaps two, three, four,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.420]   but hopefully no more than four
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.740]   of hard, strong, focused academics,
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.000]   and then the rest of the time
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.260]   be filled with many diverse experiences,
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.740]   many diverse exposures, diverse work,
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.580]   diverse business activities, diverse individual pursuits,
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.940]   diverse hobbies, et cetera,
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.800]   and that seems to me to be the best philosophy
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.740]   to create a comprehensive whole person
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.460]   who does do well in academics,
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.300]   but also maintains their diverse interests.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.160]   So that's my current approach.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.220]   - I know, very interesting,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.300]   seeing your small thought out and all your plans
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.900]   and the way you present them to your children.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.260]   I really appreciate it.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.620]   I've come across most of Mr. Gatto's work so far,
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.460]   and I don't think there was a podcast
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.700]   that presented some of his work as well.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.220]   I was wondering what other books have influenced you
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.900]   in this regard, just off the top of your head?
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   - So if I were to cite,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:38.940]   the opinions of being anti-compulsory education,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.860]   being anti-government schooling,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:45.380]   is largely influenced by Gatto and R.J. Rushduni
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.780]   with his book, "The Messianic Character
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.580]   of American Education."
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.700]   And Gatto makes the historical argument,
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.680]   kind of tracing through the historical threads
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.660]   based upon his research as a teacher.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.580]   Rushduni makes the religious arguments
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.340]   and basically advances the concept and the idea
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.620]   that the educational, the compulsory schooling problem
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.580]   or process is a religious ideal,
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.260]   which has meant that by schooling,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.420]   you can bring salvation to an individual.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.140]   And that's the cultural control,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.660]   and that's what's been most successful
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.500]   in the United States of America.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.660]   So he makes the religious argument,
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.300]   which I'm very sensitive to,
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.260]   because I see religion as the underpinning of culture.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.780]   Culture, I think as Rushduni's comment,
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.460]   he says, "Culture is simply religion externalized."
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.460]   I think that's a valid way of looking at
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.860]   and understanding the culture.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.180]   Now, so those two things have been inspirational
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.180]   in the kind of just that anti-government school perspective.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.380]   I'm currently reading another one right now,
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.660]   a book right now called "Crimes of the Educators."
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.140]   And I always feel it's very hard for me.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.700]   I don't like to sound like a conspiracy theorist,
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.780]   and it's very hard to avoid that sometimes
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.980]   when you read people like Gatto
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.740]   and you start to see the primary source material.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.860]   And what I find maddening is to try to figure out
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.140]   how do you interpret what somebody wrote 70, 80,
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.520]   100 years ago into the modern age?
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.820]   I don't know the answers to those.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.940]   So those would be just two things
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.860]   for anybody who's interested in the history of it.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.500]   Fast forward to what philosophy is of interest.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.900]   I don't have a lot of resources.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.540]   The person that my wife and I have found most inspirational
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.800]   has been Charlotte Mason.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.620]   There's a large movement in the philosophy of...
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.980]   So Charlotte Mason was a British teacher
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.620]   back at the turn of the 20th century,
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.140]   and she developed this series of schools
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.980]   that seemed to have some really wonderful results
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.300]   in the lives of her children.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.740]   And what most interests and attracts me
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.380]   is that she had the concept of education
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.240]   that involves a whole person.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.660]   If I were to try to articulate something
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.020]   that a philosopher I think is very important to me,
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.580]   it's that, it's that we need to educate a whole person.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.120]   And you can't, so you can't disconnect
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   the education of virtue from the education in mathematics.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.900]   And you can't disconnect mathematics
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.580]   from the philosophy of religion.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.020]   There is a religion, the religious philosophy
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.420]   that underpins mathematics.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.740]   There is a religious philosophy that underpins history.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.900]   And so if you try to disconnect these things,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.340]   then you wind up with a disconnected person
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.940]   that doesn't see how these things go together.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.940]   And so I found Charlotte Mason very inspirational
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.700]   from her concept of a whole person, whole person education.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.700]   The problem with Charlotte Mason is her books
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.420]   are somewhat meandering and hard to read.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.000]   It's a different writing style.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.820]   And so perhaps the best Charlotte Mason teacher right now
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.420]   is, what's her name?
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.140]   I've forgotten her name, but the leading writer
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.780]   behind Simply Charlotte Mason.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.300]   She does a wonderful job.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.820]   I've spoken with her.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.620]   She does a good job of articulating more clearly
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.120]   many of Charlotte Mason's philosophies.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.600]   And that has been most inspirational to me.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.980]   Now, the problem I have with Charlotte Mason
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.780]   and kind of the Charlotte Mason philosophy
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.220]   is it's very teacher intensive.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   And the intensiveness of the interaction
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.820]   between the teacher, the educator,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.740]   usually the parent, most normally the mother,
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.460]   it's so intensive that I wonder if it can actually be done.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.820]   Sonia, her name escaped me again.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.940]   Her name is Sonia something or other.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.580]   It's so intensive that it's hard for me to see
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.620]   how is that practical?
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.980]   And so then I read kind of the unschoolers,
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.060]   the interest-directed learning, and I see, wait a second,
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.140]   there's really something here,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.220]   because the only thing that I remember from my education
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.820]   are the things that I was interested in.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.420]   I passed so many classes that I wasn't interested in,
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.140]   and I don't remember everything.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.620]   And so I personally kind of bring those two things together.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.740]   And then finally, I'll give you one comment.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.740]   I have not yet found an inspirational educational
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.420]   philosopher who has grappled with the realities
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.580]   of the modern world.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.580]   And the question is this, how do you educate a child
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.900]   in a world where any fact is accessible
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.020]   or any piece of data is accessible with,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.420]   okay, Google or whatever Google's name, Alexa,
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.900]   no, that's not, anyway, Siri, Alexa, Google,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.300]   tell me when did the War of 1812 start?
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.820]   That's a totally different world than ever before.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.020]   And so the most important thing I see
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.740]   is to try to teach children analysis,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.260]   the ability to bring these things together.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.340]   And obviously that can't be done
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.420]   in the primary school years.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.220]   But what seems to be missing is a connect,
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.820]   in my observation of many people,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.660]   is a connected, coherent worldview,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.580]   a thing that brings these things together
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.620]   in a way that makes sense.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.460]   And so I don't have any better results for you.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.020]   It's a reading project that I need to do
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.220]   in the next couple of years,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.460]   because I've been occupied with other things.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.220]   But of course, now with a child heading into those,
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.560]   primary school is straightforward.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.940]   But once you get past primary school into secondary school,
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.640]   I'm not quite sure what to do.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.740]   - Thank you so much for sharing.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.580]   - My pleasure.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.140]   And just be, the reason I started
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.100]   with what I said in the beginning,
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.040]   just simply to recognize that things are gonna change
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.580]   is because you don't have to fit into one,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.740]   just one philosophy.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.020]   You don't have to pick one thing
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.580]   and then have it be from time to time.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.540]   If you try Charlotte Mason and it works for you, great.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.140]   You put your kid in a Montessori school and it works,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.220]   try that.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.780]   Then you go and you try classical conversations, try that.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.500]   You will change over time.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.220]   And that's the most important thing.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.300]   Look at what's working for your child,
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.780]   for you, for your wife, look at what's working
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.100]   and don't be scared to change it if it's not working.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.260]   Chris in Kentucky, welcome to the show.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.580]   How can I serve you today?
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.380]   - Thanks so much for taking my call.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.540]   - My pleasure.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.420]   - My overarching question is how do you set
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.900]   financial priorities and plan well
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.360]   when you have an income that fluctuates?
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.500]   So I quit my job about six months ago
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.440]   to start my own freelance animation business.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.580]   We shortly after found out that my wife was pregnant.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.120]   So a lot of change in a very, very short amount of time.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.740]   Business has done really well this year
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.740]   and I think I should have about $20,000 in cash reserves
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.260]   at the end of the year.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.920]   It's just kind of in the business.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.300]   So my basic, the way I've basically been conducting
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.940]   my business is I've been saving 50% of my business income
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.560]   to cover taxes and business expenses
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.540]   and then taking the additional 50%
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.860]   as like a personal income for our family.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.820]   So basically I'm trying to figure out,
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.740]   I feel a little bit confused as to what I should be
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.660]   investing in just because of the unknown nature
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.380]   of my future income, some changes, new baby,
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.060]   and then also just life goals.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.180]   We initially were really gung ho
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.480]   about paying off our house quickly,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.420]   but we also have some additional house projects
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.460]   and wanna invest for retirement.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.220]   So I think I'm at this, a lot of change
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.660]   in the last six months, have some additional cash at hand
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.900]   and trying to figure out how do I set
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.700]   those financial priorities when I'm unsure
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.820]   that I'm gonna get X amount of income
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.080]   every month moving forward.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.780]   - Is your wife currently pregnant
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.660]   or has your baby already been born?
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.540]   - She's currently pregnant.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.280]   - So first, my experience and my observation
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.420]   and my recommendation to you is
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.980]   when you are expecting a baby,
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.580]   I would encourage you to essentially hit pause
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.460]   on any big decisions.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.660]   And there are a couple of reasons for that.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.460]   This is your first child, is that correct?
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.780]   - So we have a foster child who we likely will adopt
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.780]   in the next year or so, but yeah,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.500]   this will be our first biological child.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.420]   - Okay, great.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.540]   So, and that's also if you are fostering
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.300]   and looking towards adoption, that's also
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.900]   kind of the same advice applies.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.620]   Let me just focus on pregnancy and you can extrapolate
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.760]   to fostering leading to adoption.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.880]   With pregnancy and with childbirth,
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.980]   the future becomes significantly uncertain.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:21.780]   The first thing that can happen is your goals will change.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.120]   Your understanding of life will change.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.500]   Not necessarily immediately with a new baby,
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.780]   although certainly when you are first holding your new baby
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.420]   and looking at that child and just kind of staring
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.580]   at that life and holding those little fingers
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.580]   and just marveling at the incredible creation
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.180]   that is a tiny little baby,
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.620]   there's something deeply impactful about that.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.380]   It changes your view on the world in a really special way
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.280]   that's hard to articulate.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.260]   So that's obvious, but it also changes your goals,
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.420]   your understanding, it changes the things
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.340]   that you can or can't do, and it changes your lifestyle.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.800]   There's no way around the fact that children
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.380]   will dramatically change your lifestyle.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.380]   And so, simple examples.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.420]   Prior to having children, perhaps your financial goal
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.500]   was we want to go to Europe and backpack around Europe.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.520]   Well, you can backpack with children around Europe.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.340]   You absolutely can do that.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.260]   But what might happen is you look at it and say,
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.620]   I don't really want to backpack with a child this age.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.720]   I want to wait a little bit.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.060]   And so that goal will change.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.620]   Or you'll look at your house and you say,
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.260]   previously, this particular thing about our house
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.300]   wasn't very important, but now this is more important.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.020]   Our house is not fenced.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.600]   But now, with a little toddler running around,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.420]   we'd like to be able to let them go out in the backyard,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.540]   and so now we're gonna go ahead
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.660]   and spend the $10,000 on the fence.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.400]   And I want to encourage you that that is normal,
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.540]   and that's right.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.220]   That's absolutely appropriate,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.700]   and it's appropriate for you to spend money
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.900]   on your children, because they're an important part
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.780]   of your life.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.460]   But it does mean that things will change in your planning.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.940]   Now, most of those are longer term.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.700]   A new baby, you can put a new baby
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.440]   in a little cardboard box in the broom closet.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.020]   Make sure that there's ventilation, of course.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.180]   But babies don't need that much stuff.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.460]   Now, if it's your first baby,
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.660]   most likely your house is bursting with baby gear.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.580]   By the time you get to your third or fourth,
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.700]   you'll probably just have two or three little baby things,
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.660]   and by then you've dispensed with most of the gear.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.140]   So when they're little, they don't require much.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.420]   The easy, you know, when they're little,
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.140]   you can take them backpacking very easily.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.140]   It's when they're three that it becomes more challenging.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.740]   A bigger thing to be careful of
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.700]   is you don't know how the childbirth will go.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.820]   And I think it's important to be prepared for that.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.100]   So first, you don't know how the childbirth will go
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.060]   for your baby and for your wife.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.620]   You may have a premature birth,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.500]   and a premature birth will completely
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.460]   turn your world upside down.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.900]   If your baby is in a NICU,
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.080]   and you're trying to also care for your wife,
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.220]   then you're not gonna be working much.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.380]   And so every bit of cash that's available to you
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.800]   will be helpful.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.580]   If you wind up, and perhaps something happens
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.980]   that your wife or your baby needs ongoing care,
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.800]   every bit of cash is going to be helpful.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.300]   Your wife might experience
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.420]   something like postpartum depression.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.060]   And so all of a sudden,
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.340]   you were, your wife was, you know,
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.900]   physically and mentally healthy,
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.580]   but all of a sudden, she is experiencing depression.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.300]   And now you as a husband have to figure out
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.540]   how do I love her and help her through this?
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.260]   And it's hard for you to be as focused on work.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.060]   And so because of all of these unknowns,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.080]   I think that whenever you're expecting a baby,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.900]   the best course of action is basically
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.180]   hit pause on all your big decisions.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.660]   Unless there's something that you're pretty confident about,
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.800]   we wanna move, we're gonna go ahead and move,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.220]   hit pause on a lot of those things,
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.660]   or at least hit pause on big financial things.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.500]   You know, we've done all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.780]   We moved houses when we had, I think, a two-week-old baby.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.340]   So, you know, we've done some of those things,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.320]   but in general, the philosophy is just kind of pause
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.040]   and wait to see how things go.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.520]   Once the baby's born, baby's doing well,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.620]   mama's doing well, you can pick things up
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.480]   and renegotiate going forward.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.160]   So that's my general advice, is it's okay to pause.
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.540]   One of the things I hope,
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.020]   one of the messages I hope to bring to people
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.740]   is to recognize that it's okay
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.380]   to just pause and let time pass.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.680]   You don't always have to freak out
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.940]   about every dollar's gotta be invested today,
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.700]   or every decision's gotta be made today.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.340]   It's fine to just pause and let life pass,
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.660]   and then you'll make a better decision going forward.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.240]   Now, practically, what does that mean practically?
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.260]   Well, if you might be very careful
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.900]   about putting money where you can't get it.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.780]   Now, depending on if you're gonna make things
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.400]   like retirement account investments,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.780]   you're dealing with an end of the year deadline,
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.980]   if you're gonna participate in that,
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.520]   you might choose to participate in something
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.260]   like a Roth IRA, where you are gonna go ahead and make that,
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.420]   but you can take the money out.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.300]   Or if your baby's expected before the tax filing deadline,
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   you might just wait until next year to make the contribution.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.340]   If you're dealing with a business retirement plan,
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.580]   you might do it, but you might just be careful
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.960]   about other things.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.820]   And so I would say, when you're expecting a baby,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.020]   just pause, and the same thing with adoption expenses.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.380]   You don't know what the adoption expenses
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.760]   ultimately are gonna be.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.100]   You don't know how long the process
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.720]   ultimately is going to be.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.060]   Depending on your method of adoption and fostering,
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.800]   maybe you might have house modifications that are required.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.160]   You might need to consider what's best
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.200]   in the best interest of the child.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.300]   You might need to build, a baby is easy in a small house,
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.740]   but if you have a foster baby and a little baby,
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.820]   you might need a bigger place.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.660]   And so I would say, just basically pause.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.300]   And then now I'll go back to your question
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.540]   of fluctuating income,
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.820]   which was the core of your question.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.820]   Before I do, is that,
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.920]   any clarifying questions that you wanna ask about that?
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.220]   - No, I think that helps a lot.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.780]   I think basically where I was at is,
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.860]   I think you hit the nail on the head.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.260]   Basically, I had this additional income
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.500]   that I wasn't expecting, and I kind of feel like,
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.980]   man, I really, I should be doing something with it.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.740]   I'm pretty new to investing.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.460]   I've, over the last six months,
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.060]   been listening to your podcast a lot,
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.500]   been trying to figure out some other, yeah,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.700]   things with investment
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.880]   and just being prudent with my finances.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.100]   So I think the overall comment about just hitting pause
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.980]   might be totally the right thing
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.360]   with that extra money that we'll have.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.580]   I think maybe an additional follow-up is,
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.540]   I do have a Roth IRA.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.620]   I just opened a Roth IRA for my wife.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.420]   So that was definitely an option,
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.160]   but also does not reduce our taxable income.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.700]   So I also have additionally set up a SEP IRA
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.180]   with the potential of funding that
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.420]   after the calendar year,
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.460]   when we know what's gonna happen with the baby,
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.300]   'cause she's due in February.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.840]   And then also, as far as I know,
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.180]   I can contribute to a SEP IRA
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.780]   up until I file for my taxes in 2019.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.660]   So anyway, that's kind of where my head's at.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.740]   So I think that was good.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.540]   And then, yeah, I would love to hear your input
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.420]   about the income fluctuations.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.020]   - You are exactly correct.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.260]   A SEP IRA is a perfect solution for you,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.180]   especially if your baby is expected in February.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.340]   You can try to get as much tax prep done in January
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.440]   in terms of your own expenses.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.400]   Perhaps you'll be waiting on 10 and 99s and such,
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.220]   but try to get your own accounts in order in January
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.660]   before the baby is expected.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.580]   Take February off, take March off,
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.940]   and then in the beginning of April,
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.620]   go ahead and finalize your tax returns.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.420]   And by then, you should have a better understanding
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.740]   of how mom is doing, how the baby is doing, et cetera.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.040]   And then you could comfortably at that point in time
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.780]   make your SEP IRA contributions
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.820]   and make your Roth IRA contributions at that time.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.320]   So practically, tactically,
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.260]   I think that's an appropriate solution.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.700]   Now, let's talk about irregular income.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.980]   The hardest financial problem
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.060]   that I don't know the great answer for
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.620]   is living on an irregular income.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.340]   And I have extensive experience in this
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.940]   because since about 2008,
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.140]   I have lived on an irregular income.
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.420]   And I was always a personal finance buff,
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.900]   a personal finance nerd,
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.820]   and I thought, oh, it's going to be easy
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.020]   to live on an irregular income.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.180]   And I found that it's very, very difficult,
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.180]   extraordinarily difficult to live on an irregular income
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.460]   because most of the comments about things like budgeting
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.060]   just totally go out the window.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.020]   If you have a stable salary,
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.300]   budgeting is fairly straightforward,
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.460]   and especially budgeting between needs and wants
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.080]   or luxury spending is fairly straightforward.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.060]   Let's say you sit down
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.500]   and you have a monthly income of $6,000 a month,
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.400]   and you make your savings decisions first,
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.320]   your giving decisions,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.860]   you decide how much you're going to save and give.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.220]   And let's say you net out,
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.020]   that you say, okay, we're going to spend $3,500 a month.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.660]   Well, you look at your expenses,
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.540]   you figure out how much we're going to spend on housing.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.380]   And then you say,
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.860]   well, let's assign a fun money budget of $100 a month,
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.300]   let's assign an eating out budget of $300 per month.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.180]   So then when the decision comes of, should I eat out?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.460]   Then you simply look in your budget account,
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.580]   be it an envelope, your wallet,
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.380]   a digital accounting of some kind,
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.220]   and you say, oh, look,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.140]   we got $300 or $200 left in our eating out account,
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:12.980]   let's go out.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.340]   And then when you're trying to decide,
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.240]   do we go to the fancy place or do we go to the cheap place?
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.580]   You can just simply go based upon what you feel like doing
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.540]   at the time,
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.020]   based upon how much money is left in that account.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.100]   Now, fast forward,
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:30.100]   you get a check from a client for $15,000 on January 1.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.740]   And on January 25,
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.460]   you and your wife are looking at each other and saying,
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.540]   you know what, we'd like to go out to eat.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.020]   Question, how much money do you spend going out to eat?
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.940]   Do you decide you're going to go out to eat right then?
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.020]   Or do you decide that you are going to go
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.540]   to the expensive place or the cheap place?
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.180]   It's a very difficult question to answer.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.660]   And all of the budgeting systems that I've heard
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.060]   and have tried, they've not really ever worked.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.100]   For example, one of the pieces of suggestions,
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.580]   which I think is a beautiful suggestion,
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.020]   is set up enough money in a savings account
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.740]   and then pay yourself a salary every month
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.020]   that you can live on.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.800]   So if you have business income,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.820]   put it in your business account
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.020]   and then go ahead and pay yourself that salary of 6,000
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.980]   or 3,500 a month or whatever is appropriate.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.100]   And then make sure that that account is always there.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.540]   Well, that's true.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.380]   But the problem is as a business owner,
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.180]   you often have big opportunities for investing
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.620]   in your business and you're also making those decisions.
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.820]   So you look down and you say, all right,
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   I've got enough money here in this account
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.580]   to pay three months of salary.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.740]   But there's a conference here that I'd like to go to
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.180]   and I think my total expenses for that
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.660]   are going to be $2,000.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.740]   Or maybe I should hire somebody to help me
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.860]   and that's going to change it.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.580]   And so it's just basically an ongoing battle
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:45.820]   and it's very difficult to know the answer to it.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.700]   So I don't have a great solution.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.020]   I'll give you just my suggestions.
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.700]   Number one, don't borrow money.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.660]   Every time I borrowed money, I got in trouble
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.580]   because I would overspend with borrowed money.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.700]   So don't borrow money.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.940]   Make sure that you're paying with the money
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.420]   that you actually have.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.980]   Number two, spend cash.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.660]   And one of the ways that I've always done that
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.300]   is make a distribution into your wallet and spend cash.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.460]   And then keep your bank accounts fairly static
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.220]   and then make distributions into cash
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.380]   and use that to moderate your spending.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.220]   And so even today, I don't have a beautiful system
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.420]   in my own personal budgeting.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.760]   I kind of just look at my wallet and say,
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.460]   is there a lot of money here or not?
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.260]   And how close are we to the end of the month
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.900]   and how is the money coming in
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.700]   and the money going out, et cetera.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.060]   And, but simply by focusing on the numbers in the account,
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:34.940]   the cash in the wallet,
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.820]   where I'm very conscious of every decision,
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.500]   I can usually with my gut,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.220]   just make a big enough, a good enough decision
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:45.380]   in terms of sticking to around a spending level
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.580]   that it seems appropriate.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.940]   It feels like I'm not being excessive,
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.000]   but not being, you know, miserably cheap.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.660]   Now, the big thing is keep a list of investments
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.340]   in your business that you think will help you.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.580]   If you're building a new business,
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.020]   your best investment opportunities
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.340]   are gonna be in your business.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.660]   Now they may be in employees, they may be in technology,
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.500]   they may be in tools, they may be in connections,
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.580]   they may be in a myriad of things
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.080]   that are related to your business,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.560]   but don't go investing in other people's businesses
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.380]   until you've fully maximized
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:20.220]   all of the opportunity for your own.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.460]   And in that case, what you should do is start to think,
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.740]   how could I invest productively in my business
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.260]   and keep a list of those things?
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.620]   Because most likely what you will need to do
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.420]   is spend most of your profit reinvesting in your business
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.820]   over the next few years,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.860]   keep your family expenses as modest as possible
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.580]   and as modest as necessary to be comfortable,
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.300]   but invest all that money back into your business
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.380]   until you turn it into a self-sustaining cash cow,
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:50.120]   a vehicle, and those are gonna be big dollars, usually.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.760]   When you sign up to bring on an employee or an assistant
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:58.440]   or some kind of a salesperson or a customer service person,
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.040]   then you start to, all of a sudden, $20,000,
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.640]   if you're paying $2,000 a month,
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.480]   $20,000 doesn't go so far.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.180]   When you're buying investments in software
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.920]   or tools, materials, that $20,000 goes away
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.360]   much more quickly than you're accustomed to
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.600]   in your personal life.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.140]   So that was perhaps a wordy way of saying,
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.880]   I don't have a perfect system,
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.440]   but you'll start to get in the rhythm and the groove
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.000]   of knowing how reliable and predictive your cashflow is
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.660]   and stack up money and stack up resources.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.120]   The best thing that my wife and I have always done
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.460]   is stack up money and stack up resources.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.640]   And it sounds silly, but there were times
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.680]   in your regular income over the last more than a decade,
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.560]   or I guess a decade, the last decade,
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.280]   there were times at which I would go months
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.000]   without any income, and there were times
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.320]   at which I would have massive income put together.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.800]   And one of the reasons I started the practice,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.820]   in addition to just it being a smart practice,
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.780]   but one of the reasons I started the practice
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:58.200]   of stockpiling the normal things of life,
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.700]   keeping extra food on hand, having extra toilet paper,
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.160]   and those kinds of things, buying when they're cheap,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.800]   is because when you have all those resources,
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.160]   you can pick and choose without,
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.480]   because there's an abundance of resources around.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.760]   So this month, if you just hired a new assistant,
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.400]   you just bought a new computer,
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.320]   and you just decided that you're gonna go
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.880]   to this conference that is expensive to get to
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.780]   and expensive to buy, but it's gonna give you access
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.520]   to the right network, you can go
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.000]   and you still have plenty of food in your pantry
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.380]   where you're not feeling pinched there.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.400]   But I don't have a good solution.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.520]   I've looked for one.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.920]   That's the best I've come up with by experience.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.160]   - Yeah, that's helpful.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.360]   I have one additional question if we have time.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.640]   - Go ahead.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.080]   - So how do you, and this is a hard question too,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.240]   but how do you personally balance
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.880]   having that stockpile of cash
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   and also potentially making big personal investments
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.680]   in things that you know are gonna help your lifestyle
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.440]   or just things that you need to do?
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.480]   To give you an example,
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.600]   we bought our house a year and a half ago.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.320]   We found out probably about six months after we bought it
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.240]   that there were serious structural issues
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.200]   with the back addition of our house,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.960]   which basically means it wasn't built on a concrete slab,
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.800]   all kinds of issues.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.840]   Anyway, eventually we're gonna have to tear it down
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.680]   and rebuild it.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.160]   We've gotten some estimates that say,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.080]   it's gonna cost us 45,000 to $60,000
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.360]   to tear it down and rebuild it
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.680]   in the way that we would want to.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.520]   So I think that, and for us,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.240]   that seems like a project that's probably
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.760]   three to five years out.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.000]   And all the questions obviously come up of,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.980]   should we even do it?
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.920]   It's $150,000 house, so it's like,
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.880]   we're probably not gonna get that money back,
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.120]   but from a lifestyle perspective,
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.440]   should we do it or not?
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.880]   So I guess my question is,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   how do you balance that when the stockpiling cash versus,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.480]   like stockpiling cash in your business
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.880]   versus withdrawing that cash to do something
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.780]   that's gonna be meaningful to your life or just necessary?
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.800]   - It's a hard question.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.920]   I would say the simple answer
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.880]   is talk with your wife about it,
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.280]   because you are balancing multiple interests.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.760]   So having the house work beautifully
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.800]   is probably going and be exactly
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.120]   what you would dream of it being
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.720]   is probably gonna be very important to her,
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.800]   or at least more important to her than you.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.620]   And having your business be incredibly productive
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.560]   is probably gonna be more important to you
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.840]   than it is to her.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.000]   And so you're gonna have to talk it through together
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   and come to an understanding together
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.240]   of what's best for us as an integrated marital unit.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.540]   And in general, I would say,
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.840]   start by investing in things that make money,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.600]   and especially start when you're young.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.000]   So one of the best things you can do
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.260]   is defer your consumption as long as you possibly can.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.560]   It's fairly easy when you're young
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.640]   and you have little babies
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.400]   that are easy to stick into a small corner,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.280]   and it's fairly easy to maintain the habits
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.240]   of frugality and going without
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   that have gotten you to an initial place in life.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.960]   Nobody walks into a college student's dorm room and says,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.240]   oh, you've got furniture here made from cinder blocks
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.200]   and such, what's wrong with you?
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.460]   It's normal for that life stage.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.280]   So it's fairly easy for you at the beginning of life
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.700]   to put up with things,
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.220]   because all your friends are doing exactly the same thing.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.560]   It's a little harder when you're 45 years old
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.040]   and your children are 12 years old, 15 years old.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.080]   It's a little harder for you at that point
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.880]   to have things look not as nice as they would like to be.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.120]   And it's a little bit,
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.360]   just emotionally a little bit more difficult.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.480]   So logically, start with the business,
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.960]   because the house expenses are just simply
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.680]   a pure consumption item, it's a pure luxury item,
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.240]   whereas the business will make money.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.680]   And one of the best just simple things is,
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.480]   if you have a goal,
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.200]   figure out how you make an investment in the business,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.600]   pay for it.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.440]   Instead of going and buying a car, simple example.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.920]   I've never understood why people go and buy cars
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.000]   and then put payments on them,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.400]   especially if they have money.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.480]   So if you wanna buy a $30,000 car,
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.660]   don't go and spend the money on a $30,000 car,
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.080]   because then when the car is used up, all the money is gone.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.520]   Go invest the $30,000
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.440]   and figure out how to make it give you $300 a month.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.760]   And then if you have to get a $30,000 car loan,
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.280]   pay for it with $300 a month,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.480]   at the end of it, when the car is dead,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.360]   you'll still have the money.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.520]   So do the same thing with your business.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.320]   Invest in your business, make it very profitable,
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.440]   make it run itself, make it efficient,
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.860]   make it profitable, make it productive.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.400]   Stack up lots of money.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.840]   And then in a few years,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.640]   you'll start to grasp a little bit more
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.000]   of what should change.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.280]   What you think is perfect for you today
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.520]   will change in the next few years.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.600]   And so I would say,
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.160]   I don't have a philosophy beyond,
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.820]   invest in your business,
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.880]   make it produce money for you significantly.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.560]   And then you'll have what you need
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.720]   to move on to the personal consumption.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.080]   We'll go now to the state of Washington.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.920]   Welcome to the show.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.000]   How can I serve you today?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   - Hi, first of all,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.240]   just wanna say thank you, Joshua,
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.080]   for all you do.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.160]   Your podcast is an excellent source of information.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.440]   The credit card is fantastic.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.760]   If anyone listening who hasn't got it yet
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.960]   should definitely get it.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.520]   I've already made my money back on it.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.880]   So thank you for producing such great quality.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.840]   - Thank you.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.760]   I wanted to ask you more on the business side
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.600]   of radical personal finance.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.040]   I have just a side business
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.760]   that I started a few years ago,
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.240]   but did pretty well doing affiliate marketing.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.940]   And when the,
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.440]   maybe three months ago,
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.360]   the affiliate links that I used,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.140]   Apple ended their affiliate program for apps.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.560]   And so the main revenue source is gone.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.760]   And I'm trying to convert that
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.960]   to kind of a membership model using Patreon.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.120]   Advice you could give having run Patreon campaigns
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.760]   and done it fairly successfully.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.000]   I know it's not 100% of where you want,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.520]   but you've done well with that.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.920]   I was wondering what advice you could give to me
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.040]   of what you did or what you do differently,
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.520]   or what you might suggest in converting an audience
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   from an affiliate model over to a paid membership model.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:31.360]   - So you currently have a content-driven platform
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.120]   and you have people reading your things, listening to you.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.400]   You currently have an audience, is that correct?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.240]   - That's correct.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.720]   So I can share a little bit more detail.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.240]   So I find basically apps that have gone on sale
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.920]   as well as movies.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.480]   There's hundreds of those that go on sale each day,
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.320]   and most are junk.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.020]   And so I'm curating out just the best that my audience,
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.660]   that I publish those online.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.940]   So I have an audience, about 1,300 people follow me
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.460]   across the internet and the different places
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.340]   that I publish.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.100]   And I've got, I think, 10 people
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.460]   who've actually become paid members on Patreon.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.740]   - Right.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.860]   So I am not particularly bullish on Patreon.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:20.860]   And it's not that Patreon can't help people,
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.580]   but I think it's best suited for a certain specific type
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.620]   of creator.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.980]   And it's best suited for a creator whose content
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.980]   or product doesn't, is either entertainment-driven,
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:41.180]   such as music, or is ideological,
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:48.020]   such as a certain political ideology, et cetera.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.900]   But I'm not particularly bullish on Patreon,
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.940]   even though with my own experience,
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.300]   and I'll explain for you why.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.300]   I worked very hard to, it's ironic that you are a patron,
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.380]   that's how you got access to this call.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.620]   And here we are, we are dissing on Patreon.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.820]   But I wanna answer the question
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.540]   in as clear a way as possible.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:16.940]   I love the topic of, or the concept of crowdfunding.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.980]   I love the concept of democratization of ideas.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.260]   I love the concept of individual people
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.340]   being able to support others.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.020]   I'm very enthusiastic about those philosophies.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.460]   And that was why for an extended period of time,
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:36.940]   I really hammered hard on Patreon to try to see
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.700]   if I could fulfill kind of that ideological interest
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.220]   that I have to say, is it possible to build a business
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.220]   exclusively based upon serving your customers?
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.220]   And my answer is yes, it is possible.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.380]   The problem is it's not nearly as profitable
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:58.100]   as other potential opportunities.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.580]   And so if there's, so earlier in the call,
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.940]   at the very beginning of the call,
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.340]   Anne was saying how much she had benefited
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.580]   from my course, both of my courses that I've released.
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.980]   And you made some very nice comments
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.220]   about how much you'd benefited
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.340]   from the course that I released.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:19.020]   And so those comments unsolicited by me
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.580]   demonstrate that for someone like me,
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.820]   there's a much better opportunity for me
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:27.420]   to serve specific needs effectively
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.140]   and to provide content or value.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.260]   Now I'm dealing in a space of money
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.100]   where even as Anne's recommendations,
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.580]   she recommended a course on insurance,
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.100]   a course on asset protection, a course on trusts.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.380]   That's effectively what I'm doing.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.180]   And that's, by the way,
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.540]   that's my business model going forward.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.380]   Because I wanna focus on creating
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.260]   the highest quality things that will serve people
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.820]   in specific situations.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.500]   And there's a natural model between someone like me
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.700]   selling financial information to interested people
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.340]   that may not exist if I were creating a podcast
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.300]   on political punditry or religious philosophizing
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.180]   or playing music, guitar music for somebody.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.980]   Those things don't have that natural outlet that this has.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:14.180]   But yet the profitability of my creating courses
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.940]   and is so much higher than Patreon
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.860]   that it's foolish of me to focus on Patreon
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.860]   to the detriment of courses.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.940]   I have never seen, I created,
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:32.140]   I gave a speech at FinCon, I guess it was 17 last year
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.940]   at the Financial Bloggers Conference FinCon.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.180]   And it was on Patreon.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.700]   And basically I had a bunch of my fellow podcasters.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.820]   And basically my answer to them was,
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.300]   if you have anything that's more suitable
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.940]   to your business platform, don't do Patreon.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.140]   I have never had more than,
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.300]   I've always been had far less than 1%
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.700]   of my listening audience support the show.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.420]   Which I don't begrudge, just to be clear,
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.260]   I'm not bitter about this.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.060]   But just in practical analysis,
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.460]   I've never had more than 1% of the audience
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.980]   support the show.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.060]   And I've not found a single platform
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.300]   that ever has more than 1% of the audience support the show.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.460]   Now I'm deeply grateful, so grateful
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:13.300]   to the 1% of the audience that supports the show.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.020]   I don't wanna minimize that.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:20.860]   But you can't build an ongoing business on 1%,
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.100]   unless there's a very high dollar amount involved.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.220]   And in even my own Patreon earnings,
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.980]   the way that I have structured Patreon,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.060]   the most profitable component of Patreon
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.820]   has not just been in direct support,
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.020]   it's been when I've been able to offer additional value.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.660]   One point I had a small type of,
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.460]   basically mastermind type of call
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.860]   that was very successful for a time.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.620]   I offer access to these Q&A shows.
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.300]   That's the biggest draw for people,
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.980]   is to access these Q&A shows.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.620]   And so those people who value those things
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.940]   pay a higher amount.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.100]   But if I were trying to eat exclusively on Patreon,
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.220]   I couldn't do it.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.060]   The other problem with Patreon is it puts your,
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.140]   puts your,
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.940]   your livelihood in the hands of another person
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.940]   who doesn't really care specifically about you.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.940]   Now, Patreon has had some significant things that happened.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940]   There was a couple of years ago,
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:22.500]   there was a right-wing political commentator
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.980]   named Lauren Southern, who's a provocateur on the right.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.940]   And she had a very successful Patreon account at that time.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:35.740]   And she did an event over in Europe
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:39.500]   where she went out on a boat and was basically talking to,
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.300]   and I didn't watch the video,
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.700]   but allegedly harassing migrants,
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.260]   Syrian and other African migrants into Italy.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.460]   And when Patreon saw that video,
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.740]   they canceled her Patreon account.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.260]   And they completely deleted it and canceled it.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.100]   Now, I get very concerned about that
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.420]   because one of my real concerns right now
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.780]   is censorship, that there is an ideological press
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.980]   towards additional censorship,
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.580]   especially in the United States of America.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.940]   And so if you don't conform to the orthodoxy of the day,
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.140]   there's a strong press towards censorship,
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.380]   and that's only heated up.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.780]   Without going into too many examples,
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.860]   I wanna stay focused on Patreon,
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.260]   but it's become so strong that there's this concept
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.180]   that we've gotta weed out the heretics.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.780]   So Patreon, I listened to an interview
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:31.140]   that Jack Conte gave to a conservative commentator
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.340]   named Jordan Rubin, who interviewed him,
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:39.020]   because Jordan Rubin has built a very successful platform
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.460]   built on Patreon, where he uses Patreon
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.860]   and supports a video talk show,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.020]   and it's been very successful.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.420]   And Jack Conte promised, he said,
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.260]   "We are not filtering people
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.180]   "for their ideological commentary.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.860]   "We're not filtering, we're not gonna do this.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.580]   "We're not gonna do it."
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.140]   And so I was very concerned,
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.020]   but I said, "I'm gonna believe Jack Conte.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.980]   "Maybe he's right.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.500]   "He sounds like an authentic, sincere guy.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.940]   "He's committed to people being able to use his platform."
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.820]   Well, a little bit, about four or five months ago,
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.180]   there is a researcher and an academic named Robert Spencer.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:22.180]   And Robert Spencer is an expert on Muslim theology
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.780]   and specifically jihad.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.460]   Now, he's a controversial figure
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.820]   because he has strong-winded,
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.660]   very strong perspectives on Islam
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.900]   and the integration of Islam with violent jihad.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:38.060]   So Robert Spencer created a Patreon account
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.660]   that was instantly, very quickly funded.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.500]   But Robert Spencer, and by the way,
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.700]   Robert Spencer is a very impressive person
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.620]   in terms of his academic knowledge.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.580]   There is a legitimate debate to be had
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.340]   with his interpretation of certain facts,
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.820]   but he's a very impressive person.
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.260]   He was, for many years,
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.940]   with the Department of Homeland Security
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.020]   and many national governments,
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.580]   he was a consultant on, specifically on Islam
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.220]   for the US government.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.780]   So he's not a lightweight.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:07.540]   He's absolutely not lightweight.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.900]   He started a Patreon account,
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.420]   and what happened was, within a couple of days,
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.060]   he was banned from the platform.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.740]   But Patreon's defense of it is they said,
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.620]   "We're not going to, we didn't ban him,
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.100]   "but MasterCard banned him.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.540]   "MasterCard didn't wanna do business with him
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.460]   "because he's viewed as an anti-Islamic person,
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.740]   "and because of that,
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.580]   "because MasterCard won't do business with him,
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   "and Patreon uses MasterCard to fund their pledges,
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:38.300]   "because of that, he's not allowed on our platform."
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.420]   Now, the accusations that they made against him
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.660]   were, in my opinion, in my research, completely unfounded.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.420]   And this is the problem that we face,
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.140]   especially with companies like Patreon.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.340]   And it's been more and more.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.340]   There've been other figures as well,
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.540]   but this was the most high-profile.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.740]   Now, I reached out to Patreon.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.340]   I asked for a comment.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.420]   I never received personal comment.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.260]   I am not sure if they've publicly commented on it,
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.100]   but I've absolutely lost any confidence in Patreon
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.460]   because they are going the way
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.940]   that many other large brands have gone.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.220]   And the problem is not simple.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.180]   It's not as simple as saying,
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.260]   "Well, there should be freedom of speech."
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.220]   Obviously, there is a component,
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.140]   and this is where people like me who support,
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.260]   I support the right of discrimination.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.700]   I believe that you should be allowed to discriminate
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.180]   for any reason that you want against anybody.
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.220]   Now, obviously, that's illegal in current law,
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.540]   but ideologically, philosophically,
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.260]   I support the right of discrimination.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.660]   So I support the right of Patreon
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.340]   to discriminate against anyone they want to
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.460]   for any reason they want to,
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:42.900]   and they don't have to give accountability to me.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.460]   That's an unpopular view in most of the world,
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.180]   but that's my personal opinion.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.860]   But the problem is there's such an intense groupthink
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.340]   that's happening around these platforms,
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.060]   and if you give your brand over to one of these platforms,
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.020]   you run the risk of them basically squeezing you
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.660]   and cutting you off in a moment,
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.060]   and I consider that an unacceptable risk.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.180]   The same thing has happened with platforms
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.140]   that went over and used Facebook.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.740]   I consider Facebook to be entirely untrustworthy
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.660]   at this point.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.340]   You cannot trust a company like Facebook
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.580]   because every time they come out with something,
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.460]   every time they've come out with a tool,
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.620]   they create this tool, they use it,
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.620]   and they try to incentivize people to come and use the tool
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.460]   so people say, "Okay, I'm gonna take you at your value.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.100]   "I'm gonna believe that you're acting in good faith,
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.060]   "and I'm gonna use your tool.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.940]   "I'm gonna build an audience on my Facebook page.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.180]   "I'm gonna build an audience with your Facebook tools."
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.700]   And so they invest in it, and they invest in it,
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.420]   and then all of a sudden, Facebook decides,
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.820]   "Okay, now we're gonna start charging you."
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.860]   And it goes all the way back to charging for views
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.460]   on a Facebook page.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.540]   You look at the debacle with journalism
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:48.100]   of how they basically destroy the online journalism setup.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.340]   Unfortunately, so you cannot trust them
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.420]   to behave in good faith.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.060]   And so all of these platforms, if you're going,
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.900]   in my opinion, if you're going to have interaction
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.900]   with a platform, with a provider,
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.500]   first of all, you have to be very, very suspicious of them,
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.740]   and you have to ask, "What's the business model,
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.460]   "and how am I gonna actually do this?"
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.500]   I don't trust people that I don't pay.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.860]   That's the current thing.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.460]   If I'm not paying you for your services,
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.020]   I'm not going to trust you.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.540]   So I'm not gonna trust Facebook.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.780]   I'm not gonna trust Patreon.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.220]   If I'm not paying for a specific service,
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.420]   I'm not going to trust it.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.460]   And then the second thing is you have to think about,
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:27.780]   "How do I protect myself if this particular company
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.980]   "decides they don't wanna do it?"
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.460]   Now, if you're doing apps, you're not involved
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.020]   in the cultural wars of today.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.220]   You're not talking about-- - No, I'm not.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.780]   - This is far away from you.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:40.460]   And so you say, "Well, I could just kind of skate along."
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:44.100]   Well, yes, maybe, but those are my concerns with it.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.060]   So with Patreon specifically, number one,
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:50.740]   you can expect a very, very low level of participation,
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.540]   very low level of participation.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.940]   And with that low level of participation,
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:19:00.700]   unless you have a massive audience,
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.340]   100,000 people that are listening to you
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.500]   means 1,000 people supporting you on Patreon.
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.340]   That's great.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.860]   But if you have 150 people supporting you,
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.140]   then that means one or two people
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.420]   supporting your Patreon page.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.300]   So you have to have a massive audience
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.140]   because you're going to get
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.300]   a very low level of participation.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.940]   Number two, you're putting the future of your business
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.740]   in the hands of an entity that has proven
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.900]   that they will take action if they agree
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.340]   or disagree with you.
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.340]   Now, I think Patreon is better than Facebook, right?
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.100]   But the problem is all of the press,
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.580]   the movement is in the direction
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.980]   of the companies are supposed to make
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:40.220]   ideological discriminatory positions
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.660]   because that's what's right,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:43.340]   'cause we're on the right side of history kind of thing.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.260]   And so even in your own personal life,
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.700]   if you have a website related to app development,
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:53.140]   but you hold personal opinions and positions
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.860]   that are not the orthodoxy of the day,
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.620]   you run the risk of having your business shut down.
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.580]   And I think that's an unacceptable risk.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.060]   So with a few exceptions,
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.820]   the people that I think are,
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.020]   and the exceptions are,
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.380]   if you don't have a natural normal outlet for services
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.300]   or for your own products, then Patreon can work.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.620]   I support a couple of Patreon creators.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.900]   One of my favorite,
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.620]   there's a guy named Andrew St. Pierre White,
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.860]   who's a four-wheel drive enthusiast.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.140]   He creates these wonderful four-wheel drive videos
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.380]   of overlanding, et cetera.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.700]   He's very good.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.740]   And that's really the only natural outlet for him
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.620]   is crowdfunding.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.980]   And he does such a good job with it.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.820]   I love his stuff.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.420]   I support him on Patreon.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.940]   Or if you support somebody ideologically,
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.020]   you pick somebody and they're a political provocateur
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.100]   or they're a preacher of some kind,
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.900]   or they're an artist,
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.940]   then in that case, I think Patreon's a really good fit.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.900]   But in general, it should be basically
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.740]   the last thing on your list
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.420]   because you have a very low profit,
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.900]   you have low participation.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.420]   So unless you can't find
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.060]   any other superior monetization model,
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.540]   I discourage you from Patreon.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.700]   Was that clear enough?
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.140]   (laughing)
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.420]   - That's very clear.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.340]   That's very clear.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:09.140]   There's some good thoughts on that.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:14.420]   There used to be fantastic alignment to monetization
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.700]   'cause I'm providing apps.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.540]   - Exactly.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:19.140]   - I've added the revenue and I'm just dying
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.100]   because Apple ended that program.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.700]   So need to explore other options.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.420]   So this is good thoughts on Patreon,
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.060]   especially that 1% number is a really great reference point
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.020]   for me to have and think through.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.100]   - Do the research.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:35.180]   - I researched that before I ever started a Patreon account.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.140]   I hoped that based upon my, at that time,
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.900]   my demonstrated commitment to my audience
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.460]   to produce massive amounts of what I did my very best
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.140]   to make high quality, massive amounts of content.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:50.220]   I said, if there's ever a content creator
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.420]   who can get higher than this number,
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.580]   I think I could do it
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.860]   because I've demonstrated my value already to my audience.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.060]   And at that point in time,
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.380]   so at that point in time,
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:06.940]   I thought maybe I could get higher, but I did the research.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.060]   I looked at all the big brands on Patreon.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.660]   I looked at their audience size with YouTube subscribers
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.620]   and I came to the presumption it's gonna be a small number,
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:18.220]   but I gave it everything I had and I came to the conclusion,
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.020]   we're just not really wired or accustomed
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.820]   to specifically crowdfunding something
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.180]   unless we have a strong connection with it
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:29.580]   or unless we're getting specific value.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.620]   That's why I focused on political provocateurs
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.500]   or political ideological teachers of some kind.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.180]   Those are great people for a platform like Patreon
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.940]   because there's not really a natural other way to do it
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:45.980]   other than to support that philosophy.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.980]   And so if you support a left-wing ideology,
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:50.540]   a right-wing ideology, a no-wing ideology,
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.100]   and if you can find your person
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.820]   who's preaching your gospel, then you can support them
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.020]   and you'll be happy that they're doing well.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.700]   But if you don't have that,
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.060]   then you're not gonna do the same thing.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.520]   And in general, I think there are better ways.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.700]   So hopefully that helps.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.780]   And in the future, just for clarity,
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.620]   I guess I don't have to do it.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.300]   It's hard for me, I don't wanna discount Patreon
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.300]   because I deeply appreciate everyone
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.700]   who supports me on the show.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:21.060]   But in the future, I think I'm probably going
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:25.460]   to cancel my Patreon account 'cause I don't love
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:29.420]   to do business with people who are not,
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.100]   I don't love to do business with companies like that
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.460]   and I've lost trust in them.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:36.420]   I thought when I heard Jack's interview with Jordan Rubin,
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.340]   I said, "Okay, well, I can understand
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.660]   "why they made the decisions they made,
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:44.020]   "but the Robert Spencer thing really bothered me."
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:47.280]   And so we'll see what happens in the future.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.140]   But first, I'm still working on the thing.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:50.980]   I misspoke a moment ago.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.980]   I said, number one, if you have a position
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.320]   where people wanna support you, or number two,
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   if you could have great bonuses,
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:03.140]   the most helpful thing to me of Patreon,
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.020]   or the thing that's helped the most people support me
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.740]   is this Q&A call we're on right now.
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.660]   And that has turned out to be the best bonus
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.260]   that I could come up with that has been effective
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.420]   at building a Patreon campaign.
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.660]   So if you can create great bonuses,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.020]   which involve some measure of service,
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.620]   maybe it's you providing specific consulting services
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.860]   to your customers in some way,
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:24.180]   and you can market it on the Patreon platform,
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:27.560]   then I think you can use it.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.120]   All right, last caller of the day.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.320]   Wow, what a Q&A show.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.240]   We go now to Alabama.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.080]   Welcome to the show.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   How can I serve you today?
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.160]   - Hey, Josh, my name's Brian.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.120]   I was calling because I'm interested
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.120]   in evaluating new healthcare options for our 2019 plan.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.040]   We run a small company with five employees,
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.000]   including my wife and me.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   We currently pay roughly between 25 and $28,000 a year
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.960]   to our local monopoly insurance provider.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.820]   My wife is a little scared about doing any type of HSA
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.860]   or medical sharing program.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.140]   And I'm trying to, I'm wondering if there's a middle ground.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.900]   So as the company director of these finances,
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:08.760]   I'm trying to figure out,
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.260]   is there a way to administer a savings account
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.860]   where we could take the savings
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.420]   that we would normally pay to the insurance provider
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.080]   and keep them in a form of asset
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.980]   that we could pay out to the,
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.300]   like a MediShare or an HSA scenario
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:33.060]   for the benefit of the employees that are here.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.900]   So if theoretically we could save $15,000 a year
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.620]   using a MediShare type program,
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:43.120]   would it be possible to let that money stay in the company
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.260]   and then have the company pay
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.900]   those personal medical expenses
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.460]   rather than just prepaying for the possibility
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.360]   of needing medical treatment?
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.840]   - What an interesting question.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.440]   So I need to start with my disclaimer.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.620]   I have not worked in group medical insurance
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.640]   in almost a decade.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.160]   I spent a little bit of time in that marketplace,
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.920]   but things have changed so much.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.360]   When the Affordable Care Act was passed,
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.840]   I completely got out of the business
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.800]   and I said, there's no reason for me
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.280]   to deal in this world anymore.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.360]   And I never really sold much group insurance
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.140]   and so I am not your best resource,
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.900]   but I'll try to point you in the right direction
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:28.340]   by at least asking a couple of hopefully helpful questions.
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.720]   So to be clear,
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.160]   you currently have a mainstream health insurance program,
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.000]   right?
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.320]   - Mm-hmm, that's correct.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.900]   - And the two things that you mentioned,
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.760]   you said starting potentially an HSA,
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.440]   a healthcare sharing account,
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.600]   or you mentioned the idea of moving
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.200]   to a Christian ministry approach,
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.840]   like a MediShare, the medical sharing plan.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.200]   Those are two very different things.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.680]   So you could just simply add an HSA account
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.040]   onto your current plans,
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.480]   if your current plans offer you
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.160]   a high deductible health plan,
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.040]   for you to move to a medical sharing plan
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.120]   using a Christian healthcare sharing ministry,
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.760]   that would be a very different move and a very big move.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.760]   So those are two big different questions on it.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.320]   Is there any reason why you think
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.240]   you shouldn't just go ahead and add the HSA?
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.960]   Is there any downside to the HSA?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.800]   - It looks like maximum deductions
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.240]   and maximum out-of-pocket expenses
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.400]   would be fairly similar within a rounding error
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.640]   of what we currently pay versus the worst case scenario
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.200]   for paying the HSA premium
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.800]   and then paying the maximum amount of out-of-pocket expense.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.960]   So there isn't a huge downside there
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.720]   in that particular case.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.600]   And then of course you have the added value
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.880]   of hopefully growing assets in an HSA plan.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.520]   What we were hoping to do though,
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.480]   is even with that very different option
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.400]   than the medical sharing program,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.680]   there's still an annual savings that the company would see.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.400]   Now, granted, we could just keep that,
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.720]   we could take that as a distribution,
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.480]   we could do whatever we wanna do with that difference.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.000]   But what I would hope to see is if there's a way to,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   I don't know, and that's less obvious
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.520]   than the medical sharing option,
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.480]   where there's such a significant contribution savings
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.440]   that we're trying to find a way to perhaps
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.240]   keep the burden on the company
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.960]   so that we're not paying income tax against this
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.240]   and use the company assets that would normally go
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.480]   to the mainstream healthcare provider
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.120]   to pay whatever related cost associated with it.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.760]   - Would your company qualify based upon the ideological
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.680]   and religious screenings
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.720]   of the Christian Healthcare Sharing Ministries,
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.800]   would your company qualify
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:46.240]   for a group healthcare sharing program?
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.840]   - At least for the highest paying,
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.920]   most expensive family, which would be for my wife and I,
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.360]   I can speak for us personally.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:00.960]   - So that's your problem there.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.000]   And you'll have to research it.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.520]   So there are organizations that would qualify
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.280]   if your organization, for example,
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.720]   has some statement of faith screening
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:14.200]   that your employees have to subscribe to,
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.800]   then you could qualify for a healthcare sharing ministry.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.520]   But most companies wouldn't qualify for that
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.680]   because most companies wouldn't be able
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.160]   to discriminate against employees one way or the other.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.920]   And so you could offer it.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.080]   You're not required to offer it.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.640]   You could offer it if somebody could participate in it.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.040]   But most companies, in my understanding,
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.280]   couldn't do that collectively.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.920]   So on that, you'll have to research that and talk with them
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.680]   and see if you would qualify.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.160]   If you would qualify, and if your employees,
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.880]   your three non-related employees would be interested in it,
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.560]   I think it's a really wonderful option.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.560]   I love the outcome of the Healthcare Sharing Ministries
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.240]   plans because they just do such a good job.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.320]   They align, number one, they can save you money
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.800]   out of your actual pocket in terms of paying for premiums
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.640]   'cause they're so much less expensive.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.080]   They do a really good job, in my opinion,
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.240]   of starting to change the medical marketplace.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.600]   I was very excited when under the,
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:17.200]   I think it was President Bush, George W. Bush,
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.480]   when he passed the legislation
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.600]   that brought in healthcare sharing accounts
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.840]   because I was very excited
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.120]   about the high deductible health plan.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.560]   From my reading, it was about the only option
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.060]   that could start to change medical costs
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.360]   because with a high deductible health plan,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.000]   you had an incentive to change,
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.160]   to negotiate with your provider.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.960]   Well, my experience with the Healthcare Sharing Ministry
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.120]   has been that incentive is much stronger
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.560]   because now, not only do I have the incentive
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.640]   of saving money, but I'm with a group
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.040]   of ideologically like-minded people,
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.720]   which means I see myself as part of a group of people
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.400]   that I wanna help, I wanna see them succeed,
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.920]   and so I drive a harder bargain with my medical providers,
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.920]   and then I just pay cash, and then that's right,
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.000]   that's good for the doctors
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.760]   because they can spend less time paying people
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.840]   to work through the billing,
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.600]   and they can just take cash payment,
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.360]   and then I have total flexibility also
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.160]   by not being limited to what's in network
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.400]   versus out of network.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.520]   Now, we can pit the free market against one another,
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.000]   and I can go where I'm treated best
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.840]   with whatever physician is better,
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.080]   whatever state is better,
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.240]   anywhere in the world that's better,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.840]   and so you open up things like medical tourism for,
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.800]   I mean, there's just so many options,
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.080]   so I love what Healthcare Sharing Ministries
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.720]   can accomplish financially and for everybody,
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.560]   where everybody benefits.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.560]   I benefit, the doctors benefit,
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.320]   my fellow plan participants benefit.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.920]   I think it's a really good option,
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.320]   but I don't know how you can apply it in a company
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.320]   unless there, I don't know the answer to that.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.520]   I don't see any reason not to do the HSA.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.820]   I think in that same vein of what's effective,
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:50.280]   the HSA is really good for most people.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.760]   Unless you have an employee
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.440]   that has ongoing chronic health conditions
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.880]   where they need a plan that has a low deductible,
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.000]   if you can offer a health deductible health plan,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.600]   high deductible health plan that's qualified for an HSA,
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.680]   for the majority of people,
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.080]   that's gonna be the best solution for them
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.000]   because they can get their preventive care
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   covered under the high deductible health plan,
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.200]   and yet they can still enjoy lower premiums.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.760]   Those lower premiums can be for you, good for you,
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.200]   and then what you can do as a company
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.040]   is you can just put some of those savings and match them
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.320]   or make contributions
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.680]   to their health savings account for them.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.560]   So that, in my mind, is a great use for the money.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.760]   Now, I think you could create
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.380]   some additional supplemental health plan
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.240]   if you're willing to create your own private plan,
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.980]   usually in supplement.
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.120]   I think you could create a plan
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.580]   that would allow you to spend more money on it,
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:43.420]   but that's out of,
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:46.240]   you'll need to find an appropriate consultant on that,
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.060]   and I don't know.
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:49.320]   But I don't see any reason not to do the HSA.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.160]   I don't see any reason why you shouldn't just go ahead
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.040]   and make contributions to the accounts for the employees
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.640]   and then allow them to also put their money in for them.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.280]   I don't see any downside to that.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.360]   - Okay.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.380]   Yeah, I think that was what I was defaulting to,
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.080]   just for simplicity and familiarity for the employees,
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.520]   to be able to basically give them
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.600]   the same premium amount month over month,
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.200]   but then they have the benefit
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.360]   of seeing an HSA account value grow
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.280]   compared to just, yeah,
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.000]   if they don't use their insurance all that much,
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.680]   that's just money spent,
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   which is one of the frustrating things about insurance.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.600]   - Right, right.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.400]   And you can, yeah, exactly.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.840]   It's the thing that is the very best way to help them.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.280]   And when they understand the power
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.440]   of the healthcare sharing account,
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.000]   where they, I'm sorry, the health savings account,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:34.880]   where they understand the power
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.920]   that the money can be contributed.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.360]   If you do it as a payroll deduction,
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.760]   they can avoid the employment taxes on their contribution.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:41.840]   That's really great.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.240]   If they understand that if you don't use the money
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.440]   for health needs, you can take it out in retirement.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.280]   It's a really powerful account,
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.680]   and you can match the money,
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.080]   you can put the money in for them, make contributions,
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.160]   and that'll be good for them and good for you,
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.000]   allow you to do that with them.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.480]   So I think that's probably your best option,
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:06.480]   because although, if you ran some religious organization
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.560]   where you had a doctrinal statement
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.280]   that your employees had to assent to before joining,
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.840]   then the healthcare sharing ministries would work great,
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.760]   but you can't do that
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.320]   in just a private for-profit business.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.480]   So I don't see how that would work for you.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.520]   - Well, I think in this particular case,
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.360]   we're such a small company,
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.080]   we would be able to let people who chose not to be
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.720]   in the healthcare sharing program
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.160]   to still continue with their current plan.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.440]   So in this scenario,
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.160]   I was looking at keeping the other two employees
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.960]   on just a small two-point contract
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.720]   with the healthcare provider,
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.400]   and perhaps moving my family
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.080]   to the medical sharing program alone.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.600]   - Okay, maybe so.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.080]   I would just say, I'm sorry,
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.520]   you've reached the end of my knowledge.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.560]   (laughing)
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.400]   I'm not good enough,
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.640]   but hopefully maybe there'll be a listener
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.120]   who knows something about it
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.320]   and can get in touch with me,
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.200]   and if so, I'll forward the info on to you.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.480]   If you do, send me an email, do that.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.600]   If a listener has a suggestion for you,
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.400]   you can email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.120]   and then you can go ahead and send me an email,
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.280]   and that way I have your email address
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.360]   and can pass that on after the show.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.480]   But it's an interesting idea,
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.640]   and I appreciate your doing a good job.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.640]   Employees really do value medical programs,
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.480]   especially the appropriate caliber of employees.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.760]   I hate how ridiculous the marketplace has gotten.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.480]   Unfortunately, I don't have a solution.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.440]   I don't see how it can be solved in the short term.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.840]   But for now, take care of yourself,
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.760]   take care of your employees,
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.080]   and may your business continue to grow.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.000]   That's it for today's Q&A show.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.360]   I'm gonna skip the music as we go.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.060]   I will just simply close with three things.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.440]   Number one, the healthcare sharing ministry that I use,
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.520]   the Samaritan Ministries, love them, they do a great job.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.200]   Check 'em all out.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.260]   I intend, back to the courses,
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.680]   my goal is to create a comprehensive course on that
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   and at some point,
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   and so that you can kind of work between 'em,
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.680]   'cause I love them.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.760]   They do such a great job.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.000]   We have such a great experience.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.040]   But if you wind up joining Samaritan Ministries
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.160]   in your research, go check out the past series
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.320]   that I did on the podcast,
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.160]   and if you wind up joining,
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.200]   let 'em know Joshua Sheets sent you.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.580]   Number two, several listeners made unsolicited good words
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.420]   about my courses.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:10.480]   I'm so grateful for that.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.600]   If you'd like to check those out,
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.920]   the career and income course
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.880]   is not currently available for sale.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.960]   I may be launching it.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.800]   I'm still deciding.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.640]   I'm changing a few things
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.160]   and trying to update it and make it better,
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.000]   but I may be launching that again in the new year.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.880]   I see it's the number one thing that can be done,
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.720]   but for now, go and buy the credit card course,
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.720]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse,
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.520]   and then closing, number three,
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.840]   join me next week, Monday, December 17,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.100]   Tuesday, December 18, Wednesday, December 19,
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:40.120]   Thursday, December 20, and Friday, December 21.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:43.980]   Join me at 12 o'clock, noon Eastern time for a Q&A call.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.780]   That phone number is 561-440-7362.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.800]   I'll do about an hour of Q&A each day,
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.860]   and then I'll cut things off,
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.100]   so it behooves you to get in early.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.660]   If I don't get to you, just call in again,
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   but 561-440-7362.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.520]   Join me on Monday at noon Eastern
