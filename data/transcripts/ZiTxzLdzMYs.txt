[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   This brings us to today's deep question.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.400]   What do we really seek when we seek the simple life?
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:18.200]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.380]   The show about living and working deeply
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.840]   in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.920]   I am here in my Deep Work HQ joined as always
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.160]   by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.520]   Jesse, as of today, you are now officially
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.880]   much older than me, isn't that true?
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.000]   Jesse and I have very close together birthdays.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   We're separated by a few months.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.960]   So there's a window of, let's see, what's it,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.520]   March, April, what, three months each year
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.160]   where Jesse is a year older than me.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160]   So while I remain only 26 years old, Jesse is now 27.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.060]   So you can chime in with your wisdom
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.080]   that is born only of age and experience,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.280]   Jesse, throughout the show.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.120]   Sounds good.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.940]   As you see fit.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.760]   I assume you're gonna celebrate by reading quietly
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   and deeply for hours in the woods.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.480]   That would be a pretty good celebration.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.320]   I wouldn't mind that.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.400]   Honestly, that's all I want these days.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   That would be a great gift for me.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.360]   Just going to the woods with a book you like.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.720]   Like I have a plane ride coming up
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.800]   and I have, you know, like several New Yorkers
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480]   and I'm wired and something else and a Sports Illustrated.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.760]   So it's like, that's going to take a while.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.600]   It's nice.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.440]   You start working your way through them.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.260]   Yeah.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.860]   I have a plane ride coming up as well,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.640]   but it involves also a 10 year old,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280]   an eight year old and a four year old.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.560]   It will not be as deep.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.680]   Let's put it that way.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640]   A lot of walking back to the bathrooms with toddlers though.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.220]   So that'll be fun.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.060]   All right.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.040]   Well, anyways, exciting.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.880]   Happy birthday.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440]   Let's get rolling with what I have in mind for today's show.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.680]   Today's show is actually motivated by a book
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.340]   I read a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.160]   The book was called "Living the Good Life,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   How to Live Sanely and Simply in a Troubled World."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.080]   This is an old book.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.720]   It was written by Helen and Scott Nearing in the fifties.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.880]   It came out in 1954.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.080]   It was then reissued in 1973.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.600]   And actually I think this reissue ended up being
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.420]   influential, especially in the back to land movement,
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.640]   which picked up speed in the seventies
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   going on into the eighties.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.800]   So I went back and found a used version of this book
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.040]   as I like to do.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.200]   I don't want to be on Kindle.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   I don't want to be in a new paperback version.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.800]   If there's a book that actually existed in a time period
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.200]   is of that time period intertwined with that time period.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.120]   So I have the 1973 edition.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.140]   I read it and it was interesting.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.800]   It was about this couple who during the depression
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.500]   decided they wanted to remove themselves
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   from being so intermeshed into the capitalist economy
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.140]   because they were seeing, of course, during the depression
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.900]   that these major changes could happen,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   that they had no control over and that weren't their fault.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.060]   They could really affect their livelihood,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.780]   really affect the quality of their life.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.500]   So they said, you know what, enough of this.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.980]   Let's leave New York city where we're living
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.500]   and we'll go to Vermont.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.340]   And we're going to live simply and deliberately
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.660]   in part to free ourselves from all these forces
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.060]   that are out of our control,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.460]   in part because of a Thoreau style
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.600]   wanting to not have taxes being paid
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.380]   towards efforts like wars,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.060]   and in part to be a demonstration to others
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.160]   about the ability to live in different ways
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.040]   or more intentional ways.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.420]   So they did this, started in the 30s,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.380]   wrote a book about it in the 50s.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.380]   I have some photos here.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.860]   I'm going to bring them up on the screen.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.220]   So if you're watching at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.640]   or at thedeeplife.com, just look for episode 242.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.860]   The pictures I have on the screen
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.900]   are actually not from their property in Vermont,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780]   but their later property in Maine.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.280]   So basically they lived in this homestead in Vermont
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.200]   for a long time, including when they published this book.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.820]   And then at some point they moved to Maine
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.820]   and did the same thing.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.460]   They built up a new homestead there.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.820]   So these pictures give you an idea of what their life is.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.400]   Here is Scott Neering tending his organic garden.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060]   Here they are in 1931, Helen and Scott.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.900]   So that's what they look like
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.940]   when they moved to this homestead.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.500]   They weren't young when they did this, by the way.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.580]   I mean, they were well into their middle age
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.900]   when they made this switch.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.300]   Right here, they are building a wall.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.320]   They were really into doing masonry
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   with this very particular type called slip-form masonry,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.200]   which is something that could build really durable,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.540]   really useful structures without having to have
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.140]   a lot of materials or a lot of expert builders.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.180]   So they built their house in Vermont with this.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.780]   They built walls with this.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.100]   They ate simply, they're vegetarian.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.240]   They ate with a simple wooden bowl and spoon.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.200]   I put that on here.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.740]   Here's some of their stone buildings.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.180]   So they built a house like this in Vermont as well.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.980]   So he built out a stone, they built it from scratch.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.660]   They've got these cool gardens, all very scenic,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.140]   all very bucolic.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.560]   Anyways, I'm reading this, right?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.980]   I'm reading this book because I needed it for research
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.740]   for the deep life, the book I'm writing on the deep life.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.060]   And there was an interesting dynamic that arose.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.280]   So at first glance, at first encounter,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.960]   when you read the story of the Neerings,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.120]   what you think about is these are people escaping complexity.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.140]   These are people escaping busyness.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.900]   So what appeals at first when you read these stories
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.620]   is the perceived simplicity of their life.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.380]   There is no running errands or traffic
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.220]   or whatever the 1930s equivalent was of answering email
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.100]   when you're building your slip-form masonry walls
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.980]   up in the wilds of Vermont.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.500]   But when you read this book farther and pay attention,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.540]   you see this assumption that they're living
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.880]   a very simple life is actually challenged.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.220]   They were quite busy as reported in this book
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.060]   when they were in Vermont.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.420]   They had a lot of projects going on.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.780]   And in order to do these projects,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.220]   they were having to experiment with
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.180]   and master all sorts of new technology.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.180]   So they learned how to, for example, to do this masonry.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.800]   They experimented and worked with greenhouse growing.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   They built complex terraced irrigated garden projects.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.420]   They figured out how to do wide-scale composting.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.740]   They built a sugar house
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.800]   and built a complex maple syrup production center.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.900]   This is actually what generated
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.220]   the cash they needed to survive.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.940]   They built it off of maple syrup.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.380]   Constantly projects going on, long days,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.580]   working throughout the days
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.500]   to the point where they would have visitors come.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.380]   And they report in the book, this became an issue
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.020]   because the visitors expected,
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.420]   we're gonna be hanging out with the Neerings.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.100]   You know, we're gonna sit out in their cabin
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.720]   and smoke a corncob pipe and talk about simple living.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.560]   And the Neerings would say,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.340]   "Look, if you're here, you gotta work.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.780]   We're gonna be working all day long.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.060]   We can't just sit around and entertain you."
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.700]   In addition to what they were doing on their homesteads,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.780]   the Neerings also wrote books.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.900]   This was not the only book they wrote.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.120]   They traveled, they lectured.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.840]   After a while, they began to host interns
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.860]   and other types of visitors at their properties
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.500]   to sort of teach them about this way of living,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.680]   to disseminate the word throughout the culture.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.020]   So they weren't living a simple life
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.880]   in the sense of they didn't have much to do.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.980]   They weren't living a simple life
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.300]   in the sense there's no busyness,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.180]   that they were just sort of going through their day
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.820]   and most of their time was free.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.260]   So the things that we imagine
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.460]   when we first conjure moving to the wilds of Vermont
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.500]   were not actually the things
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.260]   that the Neerings were enjoying.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.740]   So this brings us to today's deep question.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.740]   What do we really seek when we seek the simple life?
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.380]   And so what I wanna do is start with a deep dive
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.140]   and deconstruct more carefully
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.180]   what is it about this story,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.140]   stories like the Neerings going to Vermont
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.180]   that attracts our attention?
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.660]   Because I think if we really deconstruct this appeal,
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.060]   we find a more complicated set of answers,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.660]   but also a set of answers that we can more easily act on
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.540]   in the near future,
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.140]   even without a radical change to our life.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.900]   I then have a collection of five questions
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.260]   from you, my listeners.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.160]   They will all roughly orbit this general topic
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.700]   of engineering a life that's less busy,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.820]   engineering a life that's simple.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.060]   I might've actually said that wrong.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.100]   I think I did today four questions and one case study.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.340]   We get four questions and we will get one case study.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.980]   And then we'll shift gears as we normally do at the end
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.100]   and talk about something interesting.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.980]   All right, so let's look deeper here at this question
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.420]   of what is it exactly about the Neerings moving to Vermont
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.700]   that attracts us if it's not just
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.980]   they have plenty of free time now,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.860]   that their life is less crowded.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.540]   And I think the right way to think about this
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.540]   is to divide our investigation into two categories.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.060]   Category number one is the things we want to escape
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.260]   when we head towards the simple life.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.020]   And category number two is the things we want to pursue
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.220]   when we head towards the simple life.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.980]   So let's start with what we want to escape
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.420]   when we think about stories like the Neerings.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.100]   I would say number one on that list
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.280]   is going to be overload.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.180]   It's not, do you always have something to do?
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.020]   That's not an issue.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.220]   The Neerings always had something to do.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.380]   It's do you have too many things that you need to do?
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.660]   More things than you have time to actually implement.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.060]   That is what overload is.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.060]   And it's different than busyness.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.900]   It's different than constant activity.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.640]   It's not about how much of your day you're working.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.780]   It's about how much stuff is on the list
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.020]   that you're trying to get through.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.780]   And when that list gets larger
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.500]   than you actually have the time, resources,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.540]   or capacity to execute, problems arise.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.060]   And these problems are psychological in nature.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.020]   So one of the arguments I make,
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.500]   I've made on this podcast before,
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.300]   it's also an argument that I'm elaborating
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.060]   in my new book on slow productivity,
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.740]   is that there is a tax, a psychological tax,
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.720]   on every obligation that you've committed to.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.620]   You know it's there, you know you have to get it done.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.060]   That psychological tax then expands
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.500]   beyond just being on your mind
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.380]   into actual taxes on your time.
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.940]   Most things that are on your list that you need to do
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.060]   have this regular background demand
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.100]   of your time and attention.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.140]   And you gotta follow up with this person.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.800]   You need to set up a meeting.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.700]   There's some emails that have to go back and forth.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.900]   You have to do a little bit of research.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.280]   Where is that new pharmacy in the place that we're going
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   that I can get my subscription sitting there?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.100]   So these things don't just sit.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.680]   Most things don't just sit idly on your task list.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.580]   They have these little demands of your time and attention.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.080]   And I call that an overhead tax.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.940]   So if your task list gets too big,
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.940]   the sum of this overhead tax itself becomes larger.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.440]   Until after a while you find yourself
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.380]   spending most of your time tending
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.620]   and worrying about all the things waiting on your list,
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.380]   which greatly reduces the time you have
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.940]   to actually make progress on things,
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.660]   which means you fall even farther behind,
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.740]   your list gets bigger,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.300]   and the overhead tax grows even more intense,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.500]   and your window to actually accomplish things
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.520]   gets even smaller.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.780]   This is a terrible spiral.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.140]   It's incredibly stressful.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.580]   It's also an incredibly inefficient way
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.660]   to try to do important things in the world.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.820]   So one of the things we want to escape
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.900]   when we think about moving to the wilds of Vermont
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.980]   like the Neerians is overload.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.980]   Not having things to do all the time,
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.860]   but having more things to do
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.160]   than we have time to actually accomplish.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.060]   The other thing I would say we want to escape
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.220]   when we think of these scenarios is struggle.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.180]   So the simple life, let's say,
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.060]   that the Neerians are living up there,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.500]   reduced financial worries.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.260]   They lived very cheaply.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.940]   They were largely dependent on growing
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.900]   or producing their own food or bartering.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.940]   The cash that they did need,
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.500]   they generated from their maple sugaring operation.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.260]   And they just figured out exactly how many dollars
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.980]   they needed to handle the things
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.700]   or acquire the things that they couldn't barter for
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.980]   or grow themselves.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.100]   So they had freedom from the struggle of financial worries.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.660]   They had freedom from the struggle of stressful work.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.180]   They worked all the time,
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.720]   but they weren't on tight deadlines.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.420]   There was no boss who was bothering them
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.380]   about when is your slip form masonry wall
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.440]   going to be finished.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.580]   There wasn't the stress of, oh my God,
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.740]   what if we lose this client?
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.300]   How are we going to be able to pay
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.620]   the lease on our office building?
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.460]   So the struggle of stressful work they were escaping.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.900]   They were escaping the stressful environment of the city.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.860]   It's crowded, there's noise, there's crime.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.380]   There's, you're being jostled on the street.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.980]   Your senses are being overwhelmed.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.500]   So there's a simplicity to the quiet of the forest.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.900]   They're also avoiding the struggles
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.860]   that you get with things like long commutes
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.520]   or other types of parts of your life
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.000]   that are not that subjectively nice.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.620]   So there's this escape from struggle
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.820]   that's also part of the appeal of the simple life.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.480]   There's a lot of things that are unpleasant,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.820]   that if you go to this quote unquote simple life,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.660]   you can reduce.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.140]   All right, so those are things you escape,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.620]   but part of the appeal of this life,
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.460]   these type of lifestyles is also what we want to pursue.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.620]   What are you trying to gain
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.100]   by shifting to these simpler lives?
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.940]   Three things here.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.880]   Number one is autonomy.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.880]   The Neerings had complete autonomy
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.380]   over what they decided to do and how they spent their time.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.780]   So again, they always had work to do.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.800]   They worked hard, but it was on their own terms,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.160]   on projects that they thought were important.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.000]   They were also looking for meaning.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.600]   So not only were they escaping a sort of lifestyle
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.440]   that they were critiquing,
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.000]   not only were they escaping being intermeshed
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   into an economic system
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.240]   where they thought they had lack of control
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.480]   and could be pushed around because of world events,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   they were also trying to proactively demonstrate
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.200]   to the broader world alternative ways of living.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.460]   This is why they wrote books.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.500]   It's why they did lectures.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.420]   It's why they brought visitors and interns out
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.860]   to their homestead in Vermont and later in Maine.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.180]   They were trying to spread the word
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.580]   and they were successful at this.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.780]   The 1973 edition of this book really did play a big role
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.740]   in driving a lot of people from the baby boom generation
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.100]   attracted to the counterculture as demonstrated
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.780]   in the most distilled form by the hippie movement
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.720]   to embrace back to land style movements.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.040]   And for a while, this was quite a powerful social movement.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.300]   The other things we try to pursue
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.420]   when we're thinking about the simple life is slowness.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.700]   This is a property that I don't think we talk about enough,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.720]   but it's a property that's of particular importance to me.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.900]   And it's not the idea that you don't do things,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.940]   but it's the idea that no one day,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.740]   no one hour is critical.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.460]   So if I'm Scott Neering, if I'm Helen Neering,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.180]   most days, most hours, I am doing something.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.140]   But I know if I didn't feel well,
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.900]   or if the weather was bad,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.620]   or if a relative came to visit,
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.920]   if I didn't do my normal work tomorrow, it's okay.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.220]   Nothing bad would happen.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.940]   If I skipped working on this wall for the next hour,
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.100]   nothing bad would happen.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.660]   There's no one who's gonna yell at me.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.040]   There's no client who is gonna complain
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.140]   that their email didn't get responded to.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.060]   So I'm gonna call that slowness.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.760]   And I actually think this is a fundamental property
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.160]   that is well suited for the human condition.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.180]   And it's something that we didn't even know we need
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.380]   until now we find ourselves missing it.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.440]   I in particular am very wired for this type of slowness.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.700]   I will do a ton of work if left to my own devices.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.780]   If you tell me go write books and articles,
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.080]   I will write a lot of books.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.560]   I will write a lot of articles and be happy about it.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.880]   What makes me unhappy is if you say,
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.920]   tomorrow you need to come do this radio appearance
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.320]   and then you need to go to this meeting
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.600]   and then you need to go get this done in one hour.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.180]   It's the notion of this has to get done on this day.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.960]   This thing has to happen on this time.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.880]   So that if you get sick, if you get tired,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.680]   if your kids are sick for the 100th time,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.900]   this is gonna be a problem.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.560]   That causes me stress.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.040]   Work is fine, but work in which I don't have to worry
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.840]   about any particular day being critical is even better.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.940]   So this is the other type of thing that you are pursuing
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.000]   when you think about these visions of the slow life.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.680]   All right, so we had two things you want to escape,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   overload and struggle.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.060]   We had three things you want to get closer to,
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.220]   autonomy, meaning and slowness.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.040]   So what's my goal here in talking about those?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.000]   Well, when we can get this discerning
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.060]   about what it is actually deep down
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.800]   that's attracting us to stories like the nearings,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.240]   we can isolate these components.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.280]   We can begin to ask,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.900]   well, is there anything I can do right now?
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.920]   Or in the next couple of months or in the next year or so,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.280]   is there anything I can do right now
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.960]   that will help me get away
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   from those things I want to escape,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.840]   help me get towards those things I want to pursue,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.800]   even if I'm not able to in the near future,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   leave everything and go move to Vermont.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.020]   When we get past just the instinctual attraction
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.560]   to a big grand gesture and deconstruct it,
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.180]   we can identify these underlying components
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.560]   that we can do something with right now,
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.100]   even without that same degree of radicalness.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.400]   So let's go through this experiment
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.580]   with these particular properties that I just delineated.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.880]   What are the types of things that someone
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.020]   who reads this book and finds it really appealing,
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.880]   what are some things they could do
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   in the next couple of weeks
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.440]   that would move them closer to these properties
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.560]   that they are attracted to?
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   Well, financial simplification.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.720]   You could do this next week.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.680]   Overhaul your finances, reduce your expenses,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.840]   get control of your spending,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.640]   find yourself feeling like you have a buffer.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.960]   Okay, we have way more money than we actually the need.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.320]   So there's some flexibility here
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600]   because of the way that we're living,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.720]   we're living below our means.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   And so we can take that stress off right away.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.220]   Think about new work quota systems.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.760]   Okay, in my job, I'm gonna start to establish
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.360]   specific quotas on how many of projects of different types
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.960]   I actually do at any one time.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.900]   And when someone tries to add another one to my plate,
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.640]   I say, I'm happy to help, but look,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.960]   I've got this quota that I don't do
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.660]   more than three committees at the same time.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.840]   And so I have three right now,
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   so I can't do that right now.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.300]   So you put in these quota systems,
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.480]   that right away could also help
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.240]   with something like overload, right?
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.480]   So financial simplification could help with struggle.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.860]   Quota system at work could help with overload.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.300]   Simplifying your extracurricular personal activities
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.000]   could help with struggle.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.160]   You could put more seasonality
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.720]   into your work to help with overload.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.360]   You know what, I'm gonna pull back in the summers.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.240]   I'm not gonna make a big declaration about it,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.800]   but I'm just gonna be pretty clever
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.680]   about how I take on projects
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.160]   to make sure that during these two months,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.880]   I'm doing less, I have a phantom part-time job,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.760]   I'm ending my work technically at like two
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.960]   and no one really notices it.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.360]   That type of thing could help.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.720]   You can rebuild your leisure time
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.200]   around a smaller number of much more meaningful activities
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.480]   to really get into.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.560]   These are all things you could do right away.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.700]   It's not as radical as moving to Vermont,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.360]   but you're actually working with escaping the things
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.680]   that we really wanna escape in the stories
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.660]   and pursuing the things we really wanna pursue
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.160]   when we're attracted to those stories.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   Now let's move up to a broader timeframe.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.940]   Let's say we're thinking about the next two years.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.540]   And again, you wanna approximate as much of the benefits
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.760]   of a radical change like this as possible.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.040]   Well, now we can start thinking about things
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.280]   like redesigning your career.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.340]   Maybe not quitting your job
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.240]   to become a full-time homesteader,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.080]   but maybe you're able to over the next year or two
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   make the shift to say, okay, I'm gonna become fully remote.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.360]   And the way I'm gonna justify that
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.900]   is by trading accountability for accessibility.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.320]   And you set up a situation where you say,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.480]   look at how many units I ship,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.400]   how much code I produce, how many clients I bring on.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.800]   But in exchange, I want this relationship to be one
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.480]   where we have a meeting on Monday to check in on everything.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.760]   And you don't necessarily expect a lot of accessibility
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.980]   outside of it.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.760]   You might imagine a pragmatic move
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.240]   on the one to two year timeframe.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.360]   Maybe not again to a homestead in Vermont,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.000]   but maybe you leave a crowded suburb
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.440]   to go an hour outside of the city
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.180]   to a quieter rural area where the schools are fine.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.660]   You can still commute back in once a week
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.500]   when you need to see people,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.340]   but now you can have a different rhythm to your life.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.780]   You're away from the stress of say Northern Virginia
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.340]   or Montgomery County, Maryland,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.260]   but you're not moving all the way up the coast.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.340]   You're not moving into the deep countryside.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.340]   That could all make sense
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.300]   in a short term one to two year timeframe.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.580]   As could, for example, radical scheduling to work.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.860]   Maybe you over a one to two year time period
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.960]   talk to your boss about,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.440]   okay, I'm gonna go to reduced hours,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   say 20% less hours and we'll take a reduction in pay.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.640]   Like, okay, that makes sense.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.680]   You say, but here's how I'm gonna do it.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   And I work normally eight months,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.340]   nine months out of the year, 10 months out of the year.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.500]   And the other two months I'm not gonna work at all.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.240]   So it's not, oh, I'm working less hours,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.400]   but because of email and meetings,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.600]   I end up working 40 hour weeks.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.080]   Anyways, it's more radical reconfigurations
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.780]   about when you work or when you don't work.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.800]   These types of things are all pragmatically proximate
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.920]   to where you are now.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.820]   These are changes that you could imagine
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.580]   making in the next year or two.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.460]   And even though it doesn't seem as radical as first,
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.280]   as making a complete overhaul of where you live
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.460]   and how you work, they are useful.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.540]   And they're useful again,
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.260]   because we know what really appeals to us
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.540]   about these stories is not just,
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.120]   I want to build a composting heap in Vermont.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.180]   It's the escaping overload, escaping struggle,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.120]   pursuing autonomy, pursuing meaning, pursuing slowness.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.600]   And this is the general approach I want to keep in mind
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.120]   when we think about the deep life writ large.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.580]   When you encounter a story or a case study
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.900]   that appeals to you at a deep level,
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.820]   you pick up the Neering's book,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.060]   you watch a documentary about Laird Hamilton in Hawaii,
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.580]   something about Simon Winchester's farm
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.980]   in Sanford, Central Massachusetts
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.140]   just captures your attention.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.780]   When something captures your attention and resonates,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.260]   don't stop there.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.780]   Because if you stop there,
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.580]   all you're going to get is a short burst of aspiration,
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.620]   plus a sobering reality that I can't move to Hawaii
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.860]   and be Laird Hamilton.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.820]   I'm not a full-time writer who can live on a farm
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.780]   in Central Massachusetts.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.660]   And then you just fall back
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.060]   into whatever you're doing before.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.100]   The right approach here is to do what I just did
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.420]   with the Scott and Helen Neering story.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.220]   Deconstruct that aspiration.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.380]   What are the specific elements of these stories
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.100]   that are really touching you in a deep place?
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.660]   And once you have isolated those things,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.980]   you can say, okay, even if I don't make that big move,
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.800]   what little moves put me in a better position
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.980]   with respect to these components?
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.380]   Sometimes a deep life is about changing everything,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.420]   but sometimes a deep life is about learning
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.340]   from people who have changed everything
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.660]   to make a bunch of small changes
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.100]   that add up to make your situation
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.400]   much better than it was before.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.420]   So those are my thoughts on the simple life.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.740]   - I like it.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.960]   We have a lot of different blank life terminology
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.800]   on this show.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.060]   The deep life, the simple life, the good life.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.020]   - So have you started writing the book?
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.660]   For so, well, oh wait, which book are we talking about?
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.500]   Okay, the deep life.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.220]   - The deep life, 'cause you said you were researching it.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.540]   - No, I'm not writing it yet.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.220]   Where I am now is with slow productivity.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.660]   I've written that whole book, and now I'm revising it.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.500]   - Yeah.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.460]   - And I just finished the revised version
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.100]   of the first half of the book, earlier today actually.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.640]   And over the next few weeks,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.020]   I'll be finishing my revisions
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.000]   of the second half of the book.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.300]   I have it all mapped out, I just haven't done the writing yet.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.320]   So by the end of April,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.060]   we have a really pretty good version
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.180]   of that manuscript submitted.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   And then we're gonna go back and forth,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.620]   but by June of this year is when it's locked.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.980]   It has to go on in the production.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.600]   So by June of this year,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.620]   slow productivity will be locked in
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.880]   en route to a winter 2024 publication.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.720]   And then at that point,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.080]   I'm gonna start thinking about the deep life.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.040]   But I'm already, you know, I just reached,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.600]   right now I'm just reading and thinking.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.040]   And I'm not trying to, I'm not,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.800]   just to give a little bit of an insight
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.120]   into the process of writing these books.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.320]   If I was to, at this point,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.040]   start to actually translate ideas
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.960]   like I just read from the Neerings
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.160]   into outlines or potential chapters
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.800]   for the deep life book,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.520]   that would create a cognitive issue
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.840]   because it's overlapping too much
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.120]   with the slow productivity, right?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   So alchemizing ideas into structured chapters
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.800]   begins to capture your mind around that project.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.960]   So I'm not, right now all I'm doing
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.720]   is just exposing myself to a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.440]   And it'll be this summer when I'm up in New Hampshire
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.640]   and doing my fellowship at Dartmouth,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.520]   that I'll probably then be able to just
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   go walk in the woods and begin massaging the ideas
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.120]   and the chapters to really begin thinking
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.200]   about how the book's gonna come together.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.640]   - So when will you start writing it?
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.920]   Back in the fall of 2024?
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.760]   - I'm not sure.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.580]   It's a good question.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.420]   I'm a little burnt out.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.520]   I mean, part of my issue is I'm a little burned out
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   right now.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.840]   - 'Cause like last summer you were writing
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.960]   every single day all through the summer,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.920]   but you were on leave technically, right?
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.040]   - Yeah, so I'm not gonna be writing this summer.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.680]   I mean, I've been working on a lot of things,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.240]   writing Georgetown related, personal life related.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.840]   I'm a little burnt out.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.680]   So I'm not gonna write this summer.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   I am gonna think, which is my favorite thing.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.880]   I'm gonna read and think,
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.280]   but I am not, I am gonna need some breathing room
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.620]   before I'm writing every day.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.140]   - When you potentially write the deep life,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.900]   you'll probably be teaching that.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.380]   So you're not gonna have as much free time as you did
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.500]   when you were at Sulphur.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.420]   - Yeah, I'm a little worried about it.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.140]   So I'm only teaching two-
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.580]   - You might just have to give yourself more time, right?
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.740]   'Cause before you banged it out for seven weeks.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.620]   - Well, yeah, and also like,
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.340]   I don't have the summer off this summer.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.820]   I'm doing this fellowship at Dartmouth.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.000]   So I'm gonna be teaching a course and et cetera.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.460]   So I don't have the time I had.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.820]   Now I'm only teaching two courses next year,
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.260]   which is good, but they're not combined.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.200]   Like I was able to do
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.620]   when I was writing slow productivity.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.500]   So each semester has a course.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.620]   So it's gonna be not until the summer of 2024
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.740]   that I get any sort of notable break from
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.740]   where I'm not teaching.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.580]   So we'll figure it out.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.540]   I think I'm just gonna go slower.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.860]   I think I'm just gonna slow productivity this thing.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.640]   I don't have as much time as I per day.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.580]   So I'll write less and just relentless.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.860]   Little bit, little bit, little bit.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.740]   Telling you a lot of little bits add up to a lot.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.480]   But anyways, I know I need at least a summer
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.940]   of just a breather because man, my brain,
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.880]   I'm exhausted.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.080]   I am exhausted.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.040]   I mean, it didn't help that anyone who has kids
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.880]   knows that this year, because of the immunity debt
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.400]   that built up over the COVID years
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.700]   has been just like a disease artillery barrage.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.960]   It's just sickness after sickness, after sickness.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.560]   They're all bigger sicknesses
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.200]   than they would have been three years ago.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.520]   And it's just relentless.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.440]   And so you have that and all the extra work
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.920]   and yeah, I get my brain a bit of a breather, I suppose.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.040]   All right, so we've got some questions.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.120]   Before we get to the questions,
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.040]   I wanna briefly mention one of our long time sponsors
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.680]   here on the show, and that is our friends at Grammarly.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.080]   What I wanna talk about in particular
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.500]   is their new advanced tone suggestion feature,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.360]   which is integrated into Grammarly's premium service.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.680]   So Grammarly premium can sit on the devices
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.060]   where you do your writing,
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.980]   working with the applications in which you do this writing
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.000]   to help that writing be better.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.420]   The new advanced tone suggestions is a great example
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.420]   of how sophisticated this tool has become.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.300]   So the tone suggestor can actually help you
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.700]   communicate confidently and reframe your words
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.700]   to be positive, more positive, but also more productive.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.840]   So people understand what you're saying,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.120]   you seem like you really know what you're talking about
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.260]   and better results are generated.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.560]   All right, so here's a suggestion.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.280]   An example, I mean, here's an example
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.480]   of Grammarly's tone suggestions
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.840]   helping you make your communication more confident.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.720]   So this is a real example.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.260]   So if I typed, we may want to consider providing an update,
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.660]   the advanced tone suggestion said, no, no, make that,
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.720]   we should consider providing an update.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.800]   This is the type of feedback you would get from a boss
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.920]   who was really helpful or a mentor, an editor.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.000]   You can get this now from the tone suggestor.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.120]   All right, here's another example where the tone suggestor
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.800]   is helping to reframe overly negative language.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.600]   So if I write, the marketing strategy isn't right,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.400]   the tone suggestor might come back here and say,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.740]   you should say, the marketing strategy needs to be different.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.140]   These small differences in how you phrase things
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.640]   make a big difference in how you
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.040]   and your ideas are received.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.880]   This is something I have learned in my life
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.720]   as a knowledge worker and a professional writer,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.400]   and I'm very impressed by how human-like
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.960]   Grammarly Premium can be in making these suggestions to you.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.120]   So look, in knowledge, work, ideas, or power,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.860]   writing is how you convey ideas.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.880]   The better the writer you are,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.600]   the more successful you will be.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   Having Grammarly Premium is like having a copy editor
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.080]   or mentor sitting with you as you do all your writing,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   making it better.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.340]   It is invaluable if you write a lot in your job.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.960]   The right tone can move any project forward
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.080]   when you get it right with Grammarly.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.280]   So go to grammarly.com/tone
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   to download and learn more about
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.040]   Grammarly Premium's advanced tone suggestions.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   That's G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/tone.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.440]   And as long as we're talking about ideas,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.640]   which again, I really think in our current culture,
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.840]   ideas really are the best currency.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.600]   Where do you find these ideas?
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.760]   Well, books.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.120]   And who is gonna help you figure out
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   which books you should or shouldn't read?
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.960]   Blinkist.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.400]   Blinkist is another longtime sponsor of this show
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.600]   and for good reason,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.360]   because they offer a service that is right in the sweet spot
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.000]   of what deep questions listeners are looking for.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.040]   So the way it works is if you subscribe to Blinkist,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.680]   you get access to short summaries
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   of over 5,500 nonfiction books and podcasts.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.960]   These summaries typically take around 15 minutes to read.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.080]   They also have audio versions of these summaries
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.160]   that you can listen to in 15 minutes or less.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.760]   Now, the reason why this is so useful
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.360]   is it lets you very quickly triage potential next things
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.920]   to add to your reading list.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.320]   If there's a topic you're interested in
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.240]   or a book you've heard about,
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   you jump on the Blinkist, you read or listen to the Blink.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.680]   This is incredibly effective in helping you decide,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.800]   do I need to buy this book
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.480]   or is it not exactly what I thought?
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.000]   And if it's not exactly what you thought,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.720]   you still just got all the main ideas.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.320]   So you could work that into your vocabulary.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.920]   You could work that into your existing cognitive schema
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.380]   for understanding the world.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.400]   I know, for example, Jesse,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.320]   you keep a list of books you wanna read.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.920]   You just keep that in Blinkist, right?
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.880]   Is that what your strategy is?
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   - Well, I keep the list in Evernote,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.680]   but then I go through it
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.040]   and look at all the Blinks for those potential books.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.160]   - That's your triage process.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.320]   You grow this list,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.440]   and then when you wanna buy a new book, you Blink.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.520]   You read the Blinks of what, like the first whatever,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.200]   until you come across a Blink that makes you wanna buy it.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.520]   What's your hit rate, do you think?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.540]   Like what percentage, like how effective is this triaging?
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.760]   Is it like 10% of books you say I should read
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.200]   or is it 10% of books you take off the list?
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.120]   For you, what's it like?
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.280]   - Well, I also have Scribbid,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.360]   so I can just grab those books.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.200]   If they're in there,
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   I can just get them essentially with my membership.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.080]   So it's pretty high, like 30% probably.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   - 30% get cut or 30% you read?
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.480]   - I read.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.760]   - Yeah, see, I mean, so think about that though.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.100]   So even with that high percentage,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.160]   if you didn't have Blinkist,
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.400]   you would just be seven out of 10 books
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.800]   you started reading, you'd be disappointed with.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.640]   - Yeah.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.620]   - Yeah, that's, yeah, well, so there you go.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.080]   So if you're serious about the reading life,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.200]   you do need Blinkist.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.000]   They also have a special offer going on right now
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.720]   called Blinkist Connect that allows you
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.420]   to essentially get a free membership for the cost of one
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.120]   that you can then give to a friend
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.200]   who you think would like this.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.480]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.520]   just for our audience.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   Go to Blinkist.com/steep to start your seven-day free trial
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.880]   and get 45% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.940]   Ooh, 45% is good.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.320]   It's been lower than that historically.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.560]   So that's pretty good.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.880]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.200]   Blinkist.com/steep to get 45% off
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.440]   and a seven-day free trial, Blinkist.com/steep.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.480]   This particularly good discount offer
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.620]   is only good through April 30.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.040]   So you gotta get on this.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.380]   And remember for a limited time now,
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.800]   you can use Blinkist Connect to share your premium account.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.360]   So you'll get essentially two premium subscriptions
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.120]   for the price of one.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.600]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions from our listeners
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.560]   that are relevant to this general topic
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.800]   of pursuing a simpler, deeper life.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.640]   - Sounds good.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.880]   First question is from David, a 40-year-old from Australia.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.560]   Is a weekly time horizon and deep life habits
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   more effective than daily habits?
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.720]   For example, if I try to exercise every day,
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.180]   I might end up with 70 or seven 30-minute sessions,
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.240]   but lack those 90-minute sessions
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.800]   that might be better physically during the week.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.360]   - Yeah, so I think what David's talking about here
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.440]   is when I talk about the deep life,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.800]   one of the concepts I talk about is these keystone habits
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.560]   where in each of the big areas of your life,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.380]   what we call the buckets,
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.720]   you have some habit you do every day
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.160]   and you track every day, did I do that habit?
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   It's why my time block planner
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.520]   has a metric tracking space on every weekday.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.280]   So he's saying, hey, some things
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.440]   aren't best done every day.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.200]   Maybe they're best done twice a week
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.000]   and this was his example, if I'm reading this right,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.400]   is he's saying maybe it's better
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.020]   to work out 90 minutes twice a week
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.560]   than to work out 30 minutes every day.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.340]   Now, Jesse, when it comes to this specific example,
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.320]   you know more about this than me.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.040]   Working out twice for 90 minutes
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   does not sound like the right way to exercise, right?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.400]   That's a pretty long workout session, isn't it?
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.180]   Or is that--
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.200]   - I think it depends on what you're doing.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.240]   Like if you're playing tennis,
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.000]   that's gonna take at least 90 minutes to two hours.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.480]   - That's true, so sports, yeah.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   But if you're doing weights or something,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.240]   I'm assuming you probably want
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.200]   more than two sessions a week.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.880]   - Probably, yeah.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.920]   - Not that that's that important, David,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   I just was critiquing that particular example.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.440]   All right, so here's my take on that.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.080]   We need to separate keystone habits
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.120]   from other type of habits.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.560]   So the whole point about having a keystone habit
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.600]   in each area of your life that you think is important
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.560]   is it indicates to yourself
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.600]   that you take that area of your life seriously
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.400]   and it builds a foundation of discipline
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.480]   bespoke to that area of life.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   So if you're doing a fitness something every day,
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.960]   then it helps indicate to yourself
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.360]   you take your health seriously.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.840]   So if that constitution bucket of the deep life
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.680]   is important to you,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.880]   now you have a foundation of discipline
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.440]   on which you can then build other types of pursuits
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.480]   or rituals or habits.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.440]   So not everything has to be every day,
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.960]   but every bucket should have at least one thing
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.640]   that is every day.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.200]   Now there's two ways we can nuance that.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.080]   One way we can nuance that is a daily habit
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.480]   doesn't actually have to require
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.600]   the exact same activities every day.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.800]   What's important here is that you're checking off every day
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.600]   that you did something.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   So you could imagine, for example,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.320]   I have this daily exercise habit
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.360]   and every day I wanna write in the metric tracking space
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.880]   of my time block planner EX.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.560]   That's the notation I use
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.680]   to indicate that I did my exercise today.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.200]   However, what that means can depend on the day.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.080]   Maybe every other day EX means you walked for an hour
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.600]   and on other days it means that you did
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.800]   a 30 minute weight workout.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.280]   And so every day is not the same,
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.600]   but you're not going any day without doing something.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.560]   So daily accountability doesn't necessarily mean
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.040]   daily similarity.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.760]   You can have a habit that looks different from day to day.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.920]   Now, when we move outside, however,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.240]   of these keystone habits,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.120]   then certainly you can have other types of things
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.440]   you do in your life that are not at all daily.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.520]   And maybe for example, you do have like twice a week
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.920]   you play tennis, like Jesse was talking about.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.520]   That's fine.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.440]   It's not your keystone habit.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.480]   It doesn't happen every day.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.560]   This is not something you're using
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.400]   just to lay a foundation and discipline.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.160]   What does help in those cases, however,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.320]   is if you can autopilot that schedule.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.080]   So if there's something you only do twice a week,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.200]   if you know you always do that Tuesday and Thursday
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.560]   at five at the club,
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.320]   you're more likely to be consistent with it.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.600]   So you can use autopilot philosophy
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   to make non-daily habits still regular.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.000]   So non-daily habits are fine
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.560]   and you're more likely to keep them consistent
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.160]   if you're doing autopilot scheduling.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.240]   But when we look specifically at keystone habits,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.800]   you do want something that happens every day,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.560]   even if the activity can vary from day to day,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.120]   because there's that not breaking the chain power
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.880]   and just knowing every day I do something
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.520]   towards this bucket I care about.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.880]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.440]   - All right, next question's from Overwhelmed from Toronto.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.720]   "I'm very thankful for your advice
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.480]   that podcasts should focus on research."
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.160]   - Postdocs. - Postdocs.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.360]   - It changes the tenor of this question quite a bit.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.120]   - "However, I find I am in the middle
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.720]   of too many non-primary author projects,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.120]   leading me to work on my primary projects
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.440]   in the evenings and on weekends.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.080]   I tried setting up autopilot, fixed schedule,
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.680]   but I have no time to do it all.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.040]   How do prolific professors, you included,
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.000]   balance so many projects when I find
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.120]   I can't even handle four at a time?"
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.560]   - Well, four at a time's too many projects,
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.200]   and we don't do that many projects at a time.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   So I think what's going on here, Overwhelmed,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.520]   is that you might be suffering from what I like to call
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.920]   the time compression fallacy,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.440]   which is typical when you're surveying from a distance
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.680]   the resumes of someone who's very accomplished.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.760]   What we tend to do when we do this
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.880]   is we see all in one place this list
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.480]   of all these different things that they have done,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.760]   and then in our mind,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.560]   when we imagine that person doing this work,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.180]   we compress the time in which this work unfolded
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.360]   so that in our mind's eye,
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.760]   we imagine this person working on lots of these things
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.160]   all at the same time.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.360]   This used to come up so common
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.560]   when I used to write about very successful students
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.200]   that I had a phrase I used to say.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.120]   I called it the paradox of the relaxed road scholar.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   I did a study once where I interviewed
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.200]   a bunch of road scholars,
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.160]   and a lot of this got integrated into my first book,
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.920]   "How to Win at College," which came out back in 2005.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.320]   What I learned from these road scholars
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.140]   is that from the perspective of other students,
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.200]   they had all these different things they had done,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.600]   and so you would assume they'd be very, very busy,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.680]   but when you interviewed them, they weren't.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.300]   And the secret to this was, yeah, I did these six things
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.640]   which look incredibly impressive
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.800]   when you see the press release
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.120]   about me winning a road scholarship,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.680]   but I didn't do them at the same time.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.420]   This is over four years.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.960]   It added up to a lot.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.640]   At any one point, I wasn't doing all of these things.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.280]   So that's the time compression fallacy in action,
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.440]   and we see it through all sorts of different stages
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.360]   of people's careers, all sorts of different career fields.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.480]   So if you look at my own academic life, for example,
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.100]   I have published a lot
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.560]   of peer-reviewed computer science papers.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   I had to do all this math recently
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.080]   because I'm submitting my application for full professor.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.840]   I published something like 80,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.660]   80 peer-reviewed computer science papers.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.200]   This is, they've been cited something like 4,500 times.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.000]   For those who know the lingo,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.360]   it's a generated an H index of 31.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.640]   You read that all at once, and you think, my God,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.100]   you must be just writing all sorts of papers all the time.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.320]   But if you actually go back through my timeline
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.200]   through the now almost 20 years
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.320]   that I've been a professional academic,
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.200]   what you see is that, no, no, what I learned,
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.120]   this is the method I learned at MIT,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.720]   was just constant practical progress.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.520]   Always be working on a paper or two.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.920]   When you finish one, work on another.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.640]   Just make that the background,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.040]   that's the background hum of your life,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.960]   is like you're always working on a paper.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.580]   You're not working on five at once,
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.680]   you're working on one or two at once.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.840]   But if you're always are working on things, it adds up.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.080]   This comes out, that comes out, this one comes out.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.100]   And over time, it adds up to the 80 or 90 papers
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.800]   or whatever it is that seems really impressive.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   But if you zoom in on, you know, Cal in 2007
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.560]   as a grad student at MIT,
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.800]   I didn't have that much else, much going on.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.280]   Like I worked on this one paper for a couple hours today,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.880]   now what am I gonna do?
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.480]   You just repeat that over enough years though,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.320]   and a lot of things add up.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.560]   So overwhelmed, people don't do as much work
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.120]   at the same time as you think.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.260]   In fact, the paradox here is if you try to do too much
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.120]   at the same time, you sabotage those projects,
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.320]   they sabotage each other,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.860]   because you're pulling from too scarce
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.920]   of a cognitive resource,
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.200]   and you end up producing less overall.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.560]   Working on less things at a time
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.340]   can actually help you produce more.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.920]   So you need to do less.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.640]   And you have too many projects.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.440]   Your issue here is not that you haven't properly
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.880]   autopilot scheduled,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.240]   that you haven't properly fixed scheduled
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.560]   all of this work so that it works.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.320]   Your issue is you have too much work to schedule.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.000]   As a postdoc, you can't be doing four papers at once.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.800]   You wanna cut that down to two,
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.900]   maybe one primary paper and one non-primary paper.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.060]   You don't work on any more than one on a given day,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.300]   and you stick with a paper until it's done,
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.840]   or at a milestone where there's gonna be
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.080]   a long period of time until you can return from it.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.640]   So whatever, we have to now wait two months
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   to get back results from a lab.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.040]   And then you can switch to something else.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.400]   The key here is not gonna be quantity at any one time,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.240]   but just making sure that you're continually
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.320]   working on something,
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.900]   and as soon as something is done,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.360]   you start working on something else.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.440]   That's how real piles of impressive accomplishment build up.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.460]   Very impressive people are actually less overloaded
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.180]   than you might imagine,
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.440]   unless like me, they for some reason have seven jobs.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.760]   But that's a different problem.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.600]   Don't do that.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.600]   All right, what do we got?
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.640]   We got a lot of fake names here.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.280]   I'm looking at this next one, Wendell B.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah, that's probably not,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.800]   unless Wendell Berry is writing us a message.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.040]   I think we got another pseudonym coming in.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   Maybe it's this topic.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.680]   - You think it's B for Berry or just?
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.640]   - It's Wendell Berry.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.560]   - It is? - I think so.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.940]   - Okay.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.600]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.280]   Well, anyway, next question from Wendell B.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.840]   I currently serve as a minister in a full-time position,
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.280]   but wanna make the transition to teaching full-time
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.000]   in an online capacity.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I believe this move would better suit my desires
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.220]   to stay in the academy, work from home and farm.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.120]   What steps do I need to take in order to know
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.800]   when I can step away from my position
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.520]   and focus on teaching full-time online?
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.800]   - Well, the key here with anything like this,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.440]   where you get a vision for an alternative career
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.120]   around to build your life.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.060]   Whenever you get a vision like this,
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.080]   the key thing to do is to ground it in reality.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.800]   And grounded in reality means you have to find people
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.400]   who are doing the thing you want to do.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.040]   And you have to find out what is it really like?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.600]   Like, does it generate enough income
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.760]   that they can live off of it?
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.160]   And then you have to find out how did they make this happen?
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.820]   What was the path or credentials or opportunities
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.860]   that were required for them to end up in this space?
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.160]   Real people, real case studies, real information.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.360]   The reason why this is important is because human beings,
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.640]   especially dealing with this particular issue
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.960]   that we're sort of privileged to have this grapple with
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.600]   in the modern era of what do I want to do with my life?
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.520]   We have a tendency of falling into the trap
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.040]   of writing a story about what we want to be true.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.560]   And we get really into this story
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.960]   because it has the elements that we hope actually exist,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.880]   a little bit of challenge, but we overcome it.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.520]   And we get pretty excited about this story.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.300]   And it can be hard to let go of a story
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.520]   that's really appealing.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.980]   But if that story doesn't actually match the reality
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.000]   of what you have in mind,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.640]   it's only gonna lead you probably into a worse situation.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.960]   So that's why I always say ground in reality.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.240]   And you might not like what you find.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.040]   You might find, you know what?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.400]   This online teaching full-time position
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.960]   in the subject matter where you're an expert
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.000]   doesn't really exist, at least not in a way
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.480]   that it could support you full-time.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.560]   You're gonna need another plan.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.200]   That might be what you discover.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.360]   You might also discover that, okay, this does exist
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.900]   because, and then you heard of someone who did it,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.620]   but when you actually learn more, you discover,
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.480]   oh, they were able to do it
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.600]   because they were already a famous academic
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.220]   that had this big reputation
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.800]   and they were able to sort of create
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.720]   their own online thing.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.600]   But that really required them being really well-known.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.640]   You're not in that situation.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.360]   You weren't gonna be able to do the same thing.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.600]   You might discover something like that as well.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.960]   And you gotta be ready for that and say,
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.400]   okay, I need a new plan.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.300]   But if you are working backwards,
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.040]   like I talked about in the deep dive
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.460]   at the beginning of this episode,
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.240]   if you're working backwards from the elements
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.560]   of this vision that inspire you, you can pivot.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.460]   If you're working backwards, not from,
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.440]   all that matters is I'm a full-time online teacher
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.720]   who farms, but instead you have these underlying elements
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.560]   of that lifestyle that really draw to you.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.440]   If this doesn't work out when you ground it in reality,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.520]   you have other options to look into.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.760]   Well, how else could I use the career capital
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.480]   I've already acquired to make a lateral move
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.640]   into a situation in which I get more of these properties?
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.960]   This is why property-centric thinking,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.240]   this sort of lifestyle, this value-based lifestyle,
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.000]   lifestyle design thinking is so powerful
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.640]   is because it gives you the freedom
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.000]   to experiment with ideas and approaches
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.840]   to find one that'll actually work.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.640]   It doesn't require you to latch onto one particular story
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.220]   and hope it works.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.520]   So I don't know what you're gonna find, Wendell.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.800]   You might find it's impossible, you might find it's easy,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.880]   or you might find it's possible,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.120]   but you have to do more work than you thought
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.940]   to make it possible.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.200]   But whatever you find, knowing why you like this story
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.100]   in the first place is going to be helpful.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.560]   Now, I've been having this discussion
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.180]   with someone recently, reminds me of this, Jesse.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.560]   There's a student I met, he has a cool idea for a book.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.920]   And I was like, "This is great.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.000]   "I love encouraging people to have cool ideas for books."
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.560]   And he was like, "What do you wanna do with this book?"
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.200]   He's like, "I wanna publish it,
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.480]   "have an impact on the conversation,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.200]   "publish it with a real publisher."
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.160]   Like, that's great.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.120]   And so I said, "Let me send you,"
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.920]   he's like, "I can talk to you about how to do this."
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.740]   Like, yeah, I was like, "You know,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.680]   "I've written up an article about this
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.160]   "because I get asked this question a lot."
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.720]   And there's this article I wrote in 2008
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.080]   after I published my first two books.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.040]   It was like, "Here is how you write and sell
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.840]   "a nonfiction book to a major publisher."
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.280]   And I put everything I learned in that article,
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.120]   there's five points in it.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.200]   And it's what I send people when they're interested
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.240]   in becoming a nonfiction writer.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.860]   It's like, "Let's ground your idea in reality
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.620]   "because nonfiction writing is a place
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.640]   "where you might otherwise write your own story."
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   Well, he didn't like that.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.960]   He had written his own story about how he wanted the world
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.080]   to exist, it was a story in which,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.840]   and I hear this, especially from entrepreneurial people,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.280]   they often write these own stories about,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.800]   well, if I'm particularly clever about how I go about
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.080]   like writing this book and hiring this firm
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.160]   to help me in doing this and that,
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.400]   I can sort of make an end run around the normal process
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.960]   to get my book published without having to do
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.060]   the standard thing, just starting with an agent,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.920]   convincing the agent, writing a proposal,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.160]   selling a proposal to a publisher,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.100]   working with the publisher to write the book.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.320]   And I said, "Look, that's not really a great path.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.200]   "Like I'm telling you, I've done this eight times."
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.360]   Like this is how nonfiction writing works
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.160]   if you wanna publish with a big publisher.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.880]   And I haven't heard back.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.760]   Because I think it's very tempting,
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.320]   and writing, I hear this all the time,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.880]   writing is definitely a place where people
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.240]   write their own stories about how they're gonna
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.480]   become a writer.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.640]   And usually their own stories involves,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.780]   if you're diligent and clever and take advantage
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.360]   of new services that people might not know about yet,
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.400]   you can kind of greatly increase your chances
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.720]   of being published and sort of get around
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.820]   having to be judged by a gatekeeper early on.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.800]   Their stories are very enticing, but they're not true.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.760]   - I mean, maybe if he had like an in with some agent
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.200]   that was gonna pick up his call and read the transcript,
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.040]   be like, "Oh, this is great."
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.000]   But I mean, the chances of that are probably really slim.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna get too much of the details,
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.000]   but he, anyways, what he was proposing,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.040]   let's just say there's companies and services out there
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.680]   that are happy to take your money.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.960]   - En route to helping you get your book published.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.560]   Spoiler alert, if that was like a back road
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.040]   into getting your book published,
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.240]   other people would do it.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.360]   Book publishing actually has a pretty good model.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.960]   I mean, basically the model is there's agents.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.800]   So for nonfiction writing, you sell your idea to an agent.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.480]   By sell your idea, I mean this metaphorically,
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.400]   you sign with an agent because they're convinced
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.760]   that you've got a great idea
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.780]   and you're the right person to write it.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.000]   The agents then turn around
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.120]   and help you sell the idea to a publisher.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.080]   And the agents are very well suited to do this
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.280]   because they have relationships with the relevant editors
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.840]   at the relevant publishers.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.080]   There's not this over the transom type model
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.400]   of a pile of submissions arrive at the publisher
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.480]   and they look through them to decide what to publish.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.680]   Most books are actually sold over lunch, right?
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.280]   My agent knows these editors.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.240]   Like, "Hey, I have this new author.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.080]   "Are you interested?
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.520]   "You think there's another editor who might be interested?"
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.560]   And they sort of match.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.200]   There's this informal matching that goes on.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.040]   Editors who have that same sensibility.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.640]   And they say, "Yeah, let me see it.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.480]   "I'm interested in it."
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.680]   And then the agent helps you write a proposal
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.600]   that covers the things the publishers need to know.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.480]   I mean, I don't wanna go on a rant here,
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.960]   but even when I know people who get signed with agents,
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.640]   they follow the process,
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.720]   especially the entrepreneurial ones,
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.640]   all wanna in run around the proposal process.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.480]   Like, "Okay, I have an agent,
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.380]   "but I shouldn't have to do this."
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.940]   But no, there's a reason why you write
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.480]   these lumbering big proposals
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.760]   is because the agents are all former editors
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.400]   and they know exactly what the editor needs
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.320]   to be able to sell their own acquisition editor
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.360]   on paying for this book.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.920]   So when you're writing these proposals,
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.160]   what you're really doing
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.200]   is doing the homework for the editor
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.720]   so that if they love your idea,
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.740]   they can turn around and have a better chance
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.560]   of convincing their boss, "Let's pay for this."
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.280]   So again, you don't need to do it.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.400]   There's not an in run here.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   It's like, "I don't need to do this.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.120]   "Like, I've got a big audience, I've," you know, whatever.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.080]   You gotta just do the proposal and it's a pain,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.040]   but that's how it works.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.680]   And then they can use this to try to sell it internally.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.500]   Then you get your advance, then you write your book.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.020]   It's actually a pretty good process
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.960]   because the agents are desperate for sellable books.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.240]   The editors are desperate for books that can be published.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   They don't need every book
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.840]   to be a Malcolm Gladwell bestseller.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.900]   They need a pipeline full of books that are coming out.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.080]   Their whole model, especially as publishers consolidate,
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.280]   is you need a huge pipeline of books coming out.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.800]   Everyone wants you to succeed.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.120]   They want you to be good.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.520]   They want your book to be sellable.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.120]   They want to be able to publish your book
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.000]   because everyone along the way needs more books.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.760]   That's how the whole system works.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.320]   So the only thing that trips you up along these ways
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   is not that you are being unfairly cast out
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.920]   because of an ossified system.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.200]   It's that there's something that's not right yet.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.040]   You're not the right person to write this book.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.640]   The idea is not as sharp as you think it is.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.440]   Your writing's not where it needs to be yet.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   You have to get to a new level.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.840]   I mean, the reasons you get kicked out of this system
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.640]   are typically there is something that's not quite right yet
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.040]   for you to actually produce the book.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.320]   And I think it's the avoiding of that feedback.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.200]   People think, "I could just avoid that feedback
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.280]   "if I hired this service and did this and did all this."
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.520]   And then the publisher at some point will be like,
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.720]   "Oh, look at this thing over here.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.760]   "We gotta publish that book."
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.480]   And it happens occasionally.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.560]   I mean, The Martian was,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.200]   that's what happened with The Martian.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.040]   - Okay. - Right?
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.680]   And why am I forgetting the name?
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.520]   Andy Weir.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.840]   Andy Weir.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.720]   So he was actually writing The Martian
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.640]   in installments on the web.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.040]   - Yeah, you wrote an article about that, right?
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.880]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.360]   - I was just publishing installments.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.720]   He was just thinking, he just thought,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.560]   he's an engineer.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   And he's like, "I wanna think through
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.800]   "how would you survive if you were left alone on Mars?
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   "Let's get the science right."
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.960]   And so it was a fun project.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.320]   He was writing about it on the web.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.800]   But then that got really popular.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.080]   And a publisher came in and was like, "This is great.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.400]   "This could be a really good novel."
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.180]   That does happen.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.920]   But it happens twice.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.400]   It's not a consistent route to follow.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.200]   It's happened twice in the last five years
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.040]   or something like that.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.520]   - Yeah, you've talked about the need
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.680]   of how these agents and these publishers
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.200]   just wanna keep on putting out books.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   And you've said this for a couple of years now.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.520]   And it really dawns on me
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.600]   'cause then I notice all the books.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.840]   And then same with TV shows.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.120]   You know, programming on Netflix and stuff like that.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.320]   There's just always stuff.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.500]   - And books is that times 10
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.680]   because it's way less money to produce.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.920]   Their pipelines are bigger.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.400]   - Yeah. - It's way less risk.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.840]   I mean, the way I think about
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   the book publishing sales pipeline,
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.800]   the whole key if you wanna go into that world
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.360]   is not to be disqualified.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.080]   It's less than you might think
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.160]   than really trying to convince someone
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.720]   to pay attention to something
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.360]   that they'll love once they see it.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.960]   It's more about how do you avoid the things
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.120]   that could disqualify you around the way?
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.880]   And I don't know, I really preach this.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   I was like, just knowing the process,
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.560]   the little professionalism details
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.200]   that come out of knowing the process
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.040]   makes such a big difference as you go through it.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.360]   - Yeah. - It just shows through
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   at every stage.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.120]   And so it's, here's what I've learned
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.560]   because I do recommend a lot of people.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.880]   It's like, you should write a book, you should write a book.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.480]   What I have found is like, okay,
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.000]   a lot of them don't end up being able to write the books.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.480]   It's hard to avoid all those disqualifiers.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.480]   And I maybe earlier in my career
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.620]   made it seem simpler than it was,
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.660]   like my own entrance into the publishing world.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.920]   The hard thing is if you're not a professional journalist,
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.920]   you really have to have this hard to find combination
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.840]   of a topic that people are gonna feel like
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.040]   they have to read about.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.440]   Plus you being the right person to write about the topic.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.820]   So if you're a professional journalist,
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.840]   what makes you the right person to talk about a topic
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.400]   is typically I'm a professional writer.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.160]   So it really opens up what you can write about.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.480]   But if you're not a professional journalist or a historian,
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.320]   your personal experience has to make complete sense
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.000]   that you're the person writing this book.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.120]   And then you have to combine that
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.680]   with having enough writing experience
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.000]   that they don't have to worry about amateurism.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.040]   I mean, you don't have to be Gay Talese,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.800]   but you can't have amateur tells in your writing
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.160]   because they can't publish that.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.000]   Random House can't put out a book
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.800]   that has non-professional writing in it.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.640]   So you have to be past some threshold,
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.680]   which is not hard to do,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.080]   but you do have to have some experience.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.360]   It's really hard to get those three things right.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.840]   And what I found when people have,
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.000]   I know have had trouble in this process,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.460]   it's just they usually have two out of three.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.240]   So they'll have an idea maybe that's kind of killer,
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.880]   but it's why are you the person to write about this
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.680]   other than just you think it's interesting?
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.600]   Or they're the right person to write about a topic,
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.720]   but they can't, it's not killer yet.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.680]   It's still a little bit vague.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.260]   And I don't know if people realize
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.960]   like in a non-fiction book proposal often,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.200]   like how razor sharp the idea is pitched in those proposals,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.720]   even if they maybe balloon out a little bit.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.480]   Anyways, I'm ranting about the publishing industry.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.640]   - Well, writing a proposal too
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.080]   must help sharpen those ideas.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.440]   - It does help sharpen it, yeah.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.020]   And you have to do a lot of stuff that's annoying,
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.940]   but it's actually kind of good.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.180]   You have to go find competitive titles.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.600]   Here's similar books that aren't quite what I'm doing.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.480]   'Cause if there's something out there
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.360]   is exactly what you're doing,
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.200]   they don't wanna publish it.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   So here's similar books that are similar to what I'm doing.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.240]   Here's exactly how many copies they sold.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.340]   Like you have to make the case.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.880]   You actually have to make the case.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.160]   This book, this book, this book,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.220]   they all did really well for these reasons.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.000]   My book sits at the intersection of them.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.660]   So this is why we think we could do something similar.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.680]   You have to like exhaustively talk about,
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.960]   here's how I'm gonna publicize this book.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.720]   You see, I know these people, I'm in this world.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.200]   I'm gonna be on this podcast.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.720]   I mean, all of this stuff seems annoying,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.280]   but it's really, really important for them
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.880]   to try to conceive internally at the publisher.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.260]   How many copies realistically are we gonna,
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.680]   is this book gonna end up selling?
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.820]   With this type of publicity,
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.320]   looking at what comparable books do.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.760]   Anyways, so Wendell B,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.160]   I know you didn't ask about publishing,
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   but it all comes back to just grounding
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   what you wanna do in reality.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.360]   Though a big source of friction in the moment
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.920]   is really what's going to open up a much smoother path
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.760]   in the longterm.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.280]   All right, let's do another question here.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   - Hi, Jenny, a 34 year old stay at home mom from Chicago.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.040]   How can I convince my husband
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.440]   that the deep life doesn't mean
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.560]   he gets to ignore his spouse most of the time?
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.760]   He insists that he's unavailable during work hours
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.620]   to minimize distractions.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.400]   - Well, as Jesse knows,
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.240]   one of my best purposes on this podcast
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.740]   is being a marriage counselor.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.040]   I think it actually was before your time, Jesse.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.520]   I used to get a lot more of these questions
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.740]   and it was like an ongoing joke.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.720]   I don't know if you remember from the old days of the show,
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.640]   but it used to come up a lot where I was like,
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.000]   yeah, I'm glad you're asking me for relationship advice.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.820]   - Yeah.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.040]   - Like, this is gonna go really well for you.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.360]   This is gonna go really well for me.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.140]   We're all gonna end up better.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.960]   - I listen to them all, yeah, for sure.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.560]   - It used to come up more often.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.000]   Well, okay, I have two things.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.400]   I have a general thing to say, Jenny, and a specific thing.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.280]   The general thing is, if that's what he's saying,
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.960]   he's using the term deep life incorrectly.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.840]   The deep life is not just about avoiding distraction
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.720]   in work, I mean, there's a craft bucket to the deep life
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.680]   where you're trying to envision what's important to you
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.600]   in the world of work.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.700]   And maybe under there, at some point you have,
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.080]   when working on things important,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.000]   trying to avoid context switching is vital,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.600]   but that's a sub point relevant to just one bucket
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.280]   of many different buckets that are relevant
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.520]   to living the deep life.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.060]   And if you're married, as I've long said,
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.600]   these visions need to be collaborative and synchronized.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.700]   It does not work if you have your own vision,
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.440]   separate from your spouse's,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.040]   and you don't really talk about it,
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.600]   or if you do talk about it, it's just to tell them,
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.080]   here's what I'm doing, get out of my way.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:15.480]   Competing visions of the deep life is incredibly corrosive
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.800]   to a long-term committed relationship.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.280]   Married couples need to have a collaborative vision
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.880]   of this life that involves both of them.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.400]   What do we care about as a family,
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.560]   as a unit in all of these areas?
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.960]   How are we collectively going to build our lives?
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.240]   So now when you're talking about craft, for example,
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.280]   it's not just about how can we each be as successful
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.320]   as possible in our jobs?
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.080]   It instead becomes, especially if you have kids,
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   what configuration of work is going to best satisfy
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.340]   the various constraints we have?
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.160]   We want financial security,
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.360]   we want to keep our stress under control,
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.840]   we want to be able to deal with, let's say,
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.120]   like the issues of our kids that arise in a way
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.440]   that doesn't make it a constant source of anxiety,
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.280]   and make sure we have enough time.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.200]   They're like, how do we find this balance?
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.120]   You're making a collective decision.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.260]   What are our different jobs?
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.080]   What's our available flexibility?
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.000]   Should someone pull back and someone push forward?
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:08.840]   Should we both pull back?
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.080]   Should we do this for two years?
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.000]   It should be decided together.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.120]   Same thing for constitution, same thing for community,
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.660]   certainly same thing for contemplation.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.780]   Are you going to have a religion?
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.620]   What's that going to be?
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.360]   All of this has to be collaborative.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.780]   So that's my general response here.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.120]   Your husband having some vision of the quote unquote
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.400]   deep life that he's essentially just imposing on you
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.280]   and it annoys you is not the right way to do this
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.380]   in a married couple.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.120]   All right, now I'm going to take your husband's side
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.640]   and say, let's talk about this very specific issue
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   of just how accessible does he need to be during work?
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.520]   And I think you can work together
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.160]   and come up for this very narrow thing,
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.720]   a set of rules that's very reasonable
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.700]   that everyone agrees to.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.800]   So for example, here's a common thing I've heard
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.000]   in these situations.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.620]   Anything that's an emergency,
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.220]   like you actually have to have a quick response
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:03.120]   or like a kid is going to the pediatrician
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.000]   and so you need to come home
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.020]   and pick up the other kid from work.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.360]   Hint, I'm speaking from experience here.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.860]   Something like that, it's very time-sensitive.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.980]   Okay, you can always call my cell phone
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:14.460]   and even if I have my cell phone and do not disturb,
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.460]   I just have it set up so that obviously your number
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:19.000]   is whitelisted to come through, that's very easy to do.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.340]   All spouses should have their spouse's number set up
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.820]   to calls to come through
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.020]   no matter what focus mode they're in.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.820]   All right, that's easy.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.740]   Then you could have a simple rule about text messaging.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.220]   And I think a completely reasonable rule
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:35.220]   about text messaging is I will check text messages
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.860]   at least two or three times throughout the day.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.580]   But on the other hand, if I'm in the middle of a block,
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.640]   a deep work block, I'm not going to check text messages
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.680]   because if I do, it completely ruins the,
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.580]   and this is where I'm taking your husband's side,
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.140]   this idea that, hey, it would be very useful for me
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.180]   if you always just responded to my text messages right away.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:53.980]   It could ruin a whole deep work block
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.020]   if you have to do that context switching throughout.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:56.860]   So I think this notion
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.240]   of there's gonna be a two hour stretch here,
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.920]   an hour stretch here, where I'm not checking text messages,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.580]   but a couple of times a day I am.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.620]   So non-urgent things I'll see, urgent things you call me.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.780]   And if we find we have to be doing a lot of coordinating
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.400]   throughout the day, then we probably need to work
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.100]   on our household admin system in general.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.340]   It's probably too chaotic.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.700]   I, in this case, I'm playing the role of your husband
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.200]   and probably not involved enough
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.380]   in actually sitting down and working out with you.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.580]   What needs to be done this week?
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.500]   Who's working on what?
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.700]   We probably need a better weekly planning setup,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.880]   a better shared calendar, a better shared task setup.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.500]   There's a whole household admin solution here
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.780]   that probably would reduce the need
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.740]   to just have hyperactive hive mind back and forth
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.560]   throughout the day.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.820]   But it's completely reasonable to say I'm accessible,
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.380]   but not always accessible unless it's an emergency.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.820]   Now you can make your own rules here.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.900]   I don't know what's gonna work.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.940]   I don't know your situation.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.700]   I don't know what your, like your husband does.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.340]   I mean, maybe he's a Navy SEAL or something.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.980]   And this, you know, he can't answer his phone
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.840]   because he's saving someone from pirates
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.680]   or something like that.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.020]   But my point here being for this very narrow issue
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.500]   of accessibility between, you know, partners,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   you need rules, you need to agree on them.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.140]   And there's a lot of reasonable options there.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.860]   And then everyone's on the same page.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.900]   Don't just wing it.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.740]   And if you can't come up with a set of rules that works,
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.920]   then you have to fix something else
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.700]   until you have a set of rules to do.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.500]   My bigger picture point here, however,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.740]   is the deep life in general for couples
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.420]   is a collaborative effort.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.920]   It does not work if you each have your own vision.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.700]   I think they're gonna buy that
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.020]   or they both now just mad at me.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.300]   (both laughing)
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.860]   It's usually safer just to take entirely one person's side
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.380]   because you know, at least one person won't be mad at you.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.220]   - Yeah.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.380]   - Yeah, husband's gonna show up at my door.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.340]   He is gonna be a Navy SEAL.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.500]   He's like, "I have come to get my revenge."
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.900]   All right, I wanna do a case study
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.980]   before we move on to something interesting.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.300]   I like to do these occasionally where someone sends in
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:50.580]   a example of the type of ideas we write about on the show
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.740]   playing out in the real world.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.940]   So this particular case study was sent to me from Julie,
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.480]   a 51-year-old writer from Maine.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.160]   So I'm already on board.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.060]   Love the idea of a writer in Maine.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.140]   All right, so here's what Julie says.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.580]   "Last year, I took your advice
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.940]   and converted the utility shed in my backyard
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.180]   into an office space.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.900]   I have worked in every corner of my house
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.600]   and it was finally time for a dedicated space
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.340]   for me to write in.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.700]   I knew it would help me with focus and uninterrupted time,
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.940]   but I was not prepared for the mindset shift
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.020]   that went along with it.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.820]   Once the writing shed was up
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.340]   with everything just like I wanted it,
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.100]   I felt a lot more like a professional writer.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.700]   And if I'm a professional writer
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.940]   with this really cool writing shed,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.140]   shouldn't I spend my time in here writing?
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.900]   What would be the point of doing all of this work
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.820]   of building this thing
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.220]   if I just sit out there and scroll Twitter?
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.700]   I've gotten so much more writing done
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.020]   just being in the space we built
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.700]   specifically for this purpose.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.620]   Also, I've never had a space for a place near my desk
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.300]   to sit and read.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.300]   When we renovated the shed,
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.660]   we built in a storage bench
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.620]   and put a cushion and pillows on top to make a couch.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.020]   When I feel my focus shifting,
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.040]   I get up from my desk and move to the couch
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.180]   away from my computer
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.260]   and either read or write in a notebook.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.660]   I'm less likely to want to check for an important email
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.620]   if I'm working comfortably on the couch
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.860]   with my dog snoring next to me.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.900]   There's definitely a slow productivity aspect
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.260]   to building a dedicated writing space as well.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.340]   Since I'm not in the house,
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.820]   facing laundry and dishes and interruptions from my family,
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.140]   I don't feel nearly as frantic about the work I'm doing.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.700]   Because it's easier for me to take control
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.660]   of my deep work sessions,
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.180]   I'm getting more writing done
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.740]   and embracing the time it takes to get the books done.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:36.480]   It may not be a Sanderson layer, but it's pretty great.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.220]   Julie, I love that.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.460]   And of course, I talk about all the time in the show,
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.140]   I wrote that New Yorker piece
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.500]   where I introduced the acronym work from near home
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.380]   to capture this concept.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:52.100]   But it all comes down to the degree to which we ignore
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.100]   the cognitive aspects or the psychological aspects
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.220]   of doing cognitively demanding work.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.260]   Having a dedicated space just for that work
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.420]   doesn't necessarily make sense on paper.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.540]   It doesn't necessarily make sense
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.340]   when you're sitting there trying to make a plan.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.540]   It doesn't make sense when you say,
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.760]   look, we just bought this house that has a home office,
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.460]   so why in the world would I go build a shed in the backyard?
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.900]   But it makes all the sense in the world
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.200]   when you realize the psychological demands
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.020]   of trying to actually concentrate on something complicated.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.460]   This is hard for humans to do,
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.500]   and your brain needs every ounce of help you can give it.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.060]   So if you have the capability of doing something like this,
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.660]   and it doesn't have to be fancy,
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.620]   but getting some sort of dedicated space
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.340]   where you just do some type of work,
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.900]   as you learn from Julie's case study,
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.920]   there is a cascade of advantages
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.300]   in terms of productivity, in terms of sustainability,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.540]   in terms of your happiness, in terms of clarity.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.940]   There is a cascade of advantages that follow.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.660]   So Julie, I do appreciate that case study.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.940]   - Yeah, it's a good case study.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.220]   - I'm always trying to encourage people to build,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.580]   who have yards of sufficient size, build a deep work shed.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.420]   Always encouraging people.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.120]   - How's your library working out?
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.100]   - That's working well.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:01.940]   - Have you been?
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:02.780]   - I've been writing in there.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.620]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.380]   I mean, I think the key to the,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.740]   and I've been writing here as well.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.140]   So I've been coming to HQ to write as well,
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.380]   but writing in the library has worked well.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.380]   There's no permanent screens in there.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.960]   You bring in a laptop to write,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.700]   you bring it out when you're done.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.500]   So if you're reading in there, there's no screens,
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.340]   which I appreciate.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.180]   - How often do you go in there and read?
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.400]   - I mean, that's the main place I read
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.260]   if I'm reading at home.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.820]   I mean, now that it's getting warmer,
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.300]   I like to read outside, but in the winter,
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.580]   that's where I've been reading.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.080]   'Cause we have the fireplace,
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.560]   you can like turn on the gas fireplace.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.240]   So writing in there has been good.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.880]   And again, it's like a unnecessary thing
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.880]   to build this whole library out
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.200]   and build the bookcases and get these library lights
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.040]   and do all this stuff.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.880]   It's like, there's probably better uses for that money.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.240]   But on the other hand, it's there
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.760]   because I make a living thinking.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600]   - Yeah.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.360]   - And so I see that library the same way
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.240]   that Chris Hemsworth sees the big expansive gym
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.780]   he built in his house in Australia.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.100]   He plays Thor.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.520]   It's like really important that he's able to,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.340]   as easily as possible, lift heavy things.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.560]   And so I was like, okay,
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.220]   if I'm gonna be an intellectual Thor, I need a library.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.060]   - Yeah.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.260]   - So that's been nice.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.900]   I've been liking the library.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.420]   And I've been liking coming here too.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.740]   It's good to have spaces, big believer in spaces.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.620]   We don't give ourselves a big enough break
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.260]   when it comes to doing hard work with our brains.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.660]   It's all these knowledge work jobs
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.720]   where it's like, what's the big deal?
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.900]   Just be on email all day and jump in Zoom
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.940]   and just work from your kitchen
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.060]   while your kids are in the background.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.060]   What's the big deal?
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.260]   Just turn on your brain and execute.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.420]   And no one ever thinks about it's really, really hard.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.500]   - Yeah.
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.740]   Your dedicated space advice for doing different works
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.180]   has been really helpful to me over the years.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.980]   - What's your favorite space of the moment?
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.200]   - Well, I have different spaces for different works.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:51.140]   - Even just within your apartment or around town?
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:51.980]   - Both.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   - Yeah.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.060]   - I have two places in my condo.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.280]   I can come here, I can go to like,
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.800]   there's like a coaching area, like a Gonzaga.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.700]   - What about, does the club have any interesting spaces?
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.880]   Like outdoor?
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.420]   - Outdoors, I got some great spots.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.160]   - Yeah, like if you're reading, like you could probably-
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.500]   - Yeah, outdoors is like real good,
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.440]   but that's obviously weather dependent.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.800]   Like sometimes I take my Spanish class out there.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.320]   And then indoor, I wish there was a little bit more.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.800]   - You know what the coolest space
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.360]   I ever sort of was in proximity of?
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.480]   When I lived on Beacon Hill in Boston,
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.480]   when I was a postdoc, right there is a private library.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.520]   It's a subscription library that, this is Boston,
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.280]   so it's probably been around since, you know, 1694
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.580]   or something like that.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.880]   And they had, it was cheap if you were a student,
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.480]   like a grad student or whatever.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.960]   That was so cool.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.160]   I just discovered it right before we moved
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.440]   and came to Georgetown, so I never was able
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.120]   to actually make that a big part of my life.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.960]   But I was thinking, I was like, that thing was so cool.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.280]   They had this reading room where they would bring in
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.080]   all of the papers from all around the country or whatever.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.040]   And you'd go in there and there would just be
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.720]   like a bunch of upper middle-aged dudes, you know,
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.400]   reading their newspaper and drinking their coffee.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.280]   And then they just had these long tables and these statues.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.680]   And I was like, that's cool.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.520]   - Yeah.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.340]   - That's cool.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.380]   If you're gonna have like a superfluous
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:16.640]   sort of elitist space, why not dedicate it to like thinking
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.100]   as opposed to, I don't know.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.160]   - TikTok videos.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.200]   - Duck hunting, I don't know what rich people do.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.520]   I don't think this place was that expensive.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.340]   I think it had like a big historical pedigree.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.720]   Can't remember what it was called though.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.560]   It started with the anathema, I think.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.600]   Anathema.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600]   Yeah, I just thought that was always cool.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.560]   All right, I wanna do something interesting,
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.920]   but firstly, briefly mention another longtime sponsor
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.580]   of the show, our friends at My Body Tutor.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.200]   If you wanna get in better shape and you don't have access
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.520]   to Thor's gym and all of his trainers,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.420]   My Body Tutor is the way to do it.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.420]   It's a 100% online coaching program
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.620]   that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.860]   which is the lack of consistency.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.860]   It works by connecting you to a dedicated online coach
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.880]   who works with you in your specific circumstances,
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.580]   your specific goals, your specific constraints
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.660]   to come up with a plan.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.580]   What are we gonna do with eating?
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.100]   What are we gonna do with exercise?
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.200]   And then you report back every day, how did it go?
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.060]   And you get feedback and encouragement from your coach.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.460]   If you need to switch things on the fly,
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.700]   the coach can help you do it.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.920]   Oh, you're traveling, here's what we're gonna do.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.300]   So having that dedicated coach you talk to every day
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.140]   makes all of the difference.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.180]   And because it's 100% online,
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.320]   it doesn't have that same massive expense
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.020]   that you would require to have a trainer
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.300]   come to your house, for example.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.020]   So if you're serious about getting fit,
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.180]   they are gonna give Deep Questions listeners
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.060]   $50 off their first month.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.360]   So if you go to mybodytutor, T-U-T-O-R.com and sign up,
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.540]   just mention you came from Deep Questions,
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.740]   they will knock off $50.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:56.320]   My Body Tutor is the right way to get healthier.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.180]   I'm a fan of those guys.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.820]   I've known Adam Gilbert for a long time.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.660]   He runs a tight shop there.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.880]   They've been doing that thing forever.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.380]   - Yeah. - It's a great company.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.940]   I also wanna talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:12.040]   If you use the internet, which I assume you probably do,
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.460]   you need to have a VPN or virtual private network.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.620]   So here's the problem with the way
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.100]   that most people use the internet
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:22.180]   is that people can see what you're doing.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:25.980]   So if you're connecting through a public wifi access point,
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.740]   people can sniff your packets off of the wire
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.220]   and see what site or service are you talking to.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.140]   Even if the contents of your message maybe are encrypted,
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.840]   the destination is not.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.820]   So people can see which site or service you're talking to.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.900]   Let's say you're at home,
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.340]   you're like, "No one's sniffing my packets."
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:46.020]   Your internet service provider sees who you're talking to.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:46.880]   And you know what?
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.180]   They can collect that data.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.020]   And you know what?
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.300]   They can sell that data.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.220]   And you know what?
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.460]   They probably do.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.540]   This is where a virtual private network comes into play.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.420]   It works as follows.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.180]   Instead of connecting to the site
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.580]   or service you wanna talk to,
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:02.740]   you instead connect to a virtual private network server,
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.220]   a VPN server.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.820]   And you send an encrypted message to that server saying,
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.800]   "Here's who I really wanna talk to."
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.300]   The server talks to that site or service on your behalf,
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.460]   encrypts the response and sends it back to you.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.300]   What does this mean?
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.920]   This means your internet service provider
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.740]   or people sitting next to you in Starbucks,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.260]   all they know is that you're talking to a VPN server.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.640]   They gain no information about the actual site
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.500]   or the actual service that you're using.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.780]   So this is internet privacy and security 101.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.540]   So if you're gonna use a VPN,
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.500]   the one I recommend is ExpressVPN.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.640]   They have servers all over the world.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.700]   They have a lot of bandwidth for these servers.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.820]   So you can have a fast, high bandwidth connection.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.540]   So you'll notice no lag in your internet connection.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.700]   And their software is very easy to use.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.740]   You click a button once it's installed to turn it on
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.240]   and you just use all of your apps and browsers
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.340]   like you normally would.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.180]   And in the background,
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:57.060]   it's shunting off your information through a local server.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.600]   So you need a VPN.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.900]   And I think ExpressVPN is the one you need.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.840]   It's also rated number one by CNET, Wired, TechRadar
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.520]   and countless others.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.780]   So stop handing over your personal data to big tech
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.440]   or your internet service provider,
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.420]   that weirdo next to you at Starbucks
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.040]   and protect yourself with the VPN.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.100]   I trust to keep me safe online.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.580]   Visit expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:24.580]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/deep.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:27.580]   And you will get three extra months free.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.700]   Don't forget that .com/deep.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.620]   So expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.140]   Don't forget that /deep to get your extra three months free.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.180]   Go there now to learn more.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.780]   All right, so what I wanna do with our last segment is,
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.420]   as I often do, talk about something interesting.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.020]   So as you know, I maintain this address,
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.660]   interesting@calnewport.com,
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.580]   in which anyone can send me any article or link or video
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.540]   they think I might like.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.320]   And even though I can't respond to most of these messages,
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.380]   I do read most of them
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.420]   and it's a real cool source of interesting material.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.940]   So today I wanna talk about something that you sent me
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.180]   in this address.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:16.220]   This is an article, the version I have here is from ABC,
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.080]   though this was widely covered,
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.840]   that is discussing a interesting piece of recent news.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.140]   Here's the headline of this article.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.900]   Oh man, there is a,
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.500]   I don't know if this shows up on the screen, Jesse,
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.340]   but it's interesting.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.700]   So I'm on the ABC News.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:31.580]   - Yeah, it's coming up.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.020]   - That's interesting too.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.300]   So what I wanna talk about is this article from ABC News
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.060]   and the headline is Utah social media law
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.140]   means kids need approval from parents.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:48.020]   But if you're watching online at youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.300]   episode 242 or at thedeeplife.com,
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.500]   you'll see that ABC is dominating the screen
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.620]   by a picture of an impossibly fit old lady
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:03.620]   next to a bear who I'm assuming she's married to.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.140]   I mean, it's not exactly clear from this context,
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.400]   but that's what I'm going to assume.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.740]   They seem like they know each other very well.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.140]   And what is the headline for this?
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.460]   Intermittent fasting for seniors.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.300]   I don't know, Jesse,
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.540]   maybe this is what we should be reading.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.460]   This like super jacked lady who's married to a bear.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.180]   She gonna eat the bear?
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.620]   This is about fasting.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.660]   Well, all right, so you gotta see this.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.620]   You gotta go to youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.460]   to see this picture.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.540]   Otherwise I sound like a crazy person.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.500]   But let's talk about this actual article.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.180]   All right, with great regret, I'm gonna shut this ad.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.860]   All right, let's talk about this actual article.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:42.300]   Utah is passing a new law
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:48.540]   to help restrict kids' social media usage.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.140]   So there's a couple of things this law includes.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.940]   And I'm reading here from the article.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.420]   Children and teens in Utah would lose access
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.060]   to social media apps such as TikTok
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.160]   if they don't have parental consent.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.280]   They face other restrictions as well,
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.260]   such as, for example, a prohibition on kids under 18
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.260]   from using social media between the hours
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.620]   of 10.30 p.m. and 6.30 a.m.,
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.080]   as well as age verification
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.180]   of anyone who wants to use social media,
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.780]   and a few other things as well.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.860]   I think one of the more controversial parts of this bill
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.040]   is if you're a minor using social media,
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.440]   your parents have to have access to your account.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.140]   There's a lot of these laws percolating up
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.640]   at the state level right now.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.440]   The coverage and reaction to these laws is very complicated
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.240]   because they keep crossing back and forth
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.800]   over our standard political partisan lines.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.660]   So it's a Republican governor,
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.300]   Governor Spencer Cox in Utah, who's suggesting this law.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.140]   Blue State, Massachusetts has a similar law.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.480]   You look at people lining up to talk about these,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.360]   you can see the confusion because most organizations know,
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.580]   here's the way it works.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.260]   We belong to one particular ideological team,
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.500]   and we wanna see if something,
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.100]   our teams or the other team's thing,
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.040]   and if it's the other team's thing,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.500]   our job is to make sure it looks bad.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.420]   And if it's our team's thing,
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.060]   it's our job to make it look right.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.780]   But for this particular issue, the teams are all scrambled.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.900]   The Surgeon General of the Joe Biden administration
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:21.640]   is in favor of 16 as a minimum age for using social media.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.580]   Josh Hawley, Senator Josh Hawley,
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.220]   is also in favor of 16 being a minimum age
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.060]   for social media.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.980]   You could not have two people that were farther away
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.460]   on the political spectrum.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.420]   So even in this article itself, you see this confusion.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.660]   Electronic Freedom Foundation is coming out strong.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.480]   We don't like this.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.320]   This is no good.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.620]   Common Sense Media is coming in and say,
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.900]   but actually, wait, maybe this is good.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.580]   Kids are getting pretty addicted to these things.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.800]   No one really knows where to stand on this.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.960]   So it's amusing to watch
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.100]   as well as a source of consternation
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.940]   because of the partisanship
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:54.380]   that especially dictates so much online discussion.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.620]   Self-referential discussion
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.700]   on how people should use online services
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.080]   are confused and complicated.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.460]   So I got to cut through to what my emerging thoughts on this.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.320]   I think simplicity is key here.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.980]   There is an existing job, COPA.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.260]   That is an abbreviation.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.540]   I always get the actual acronym,
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.660]   the details of the acronym wrong.
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.980]   It's in this article, so I'm scrolling here.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.500]   But there's an existing law on the books
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.620]   that's abbreviated as COPA,
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.460]   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.940]   This is a law that's federal,
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.260]   and it implicitly establishes 13
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.940]   as the minimum age to use social media.
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.780]   I say implicitly
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.760]   because the way the law is actually worded
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.940]   is it's talking about the minimum age
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.020]   at which an individual can consent
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.740]   to give up their data or privacy to another company.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.900]   Because social media by definition does this,
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:50.500]   it's implicitly a de facto age limit on social media.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.140]   An interesting side note about this law,
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.500]   which I learned from a social psychologist, John Haidt,
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.580]   who's done a lot of good work on this issue,
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.940]   is that the original draft of COPA had this age at 16.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.840]   It got changed because of intense lobbying
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.060]   from the tech industry.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.900]   They brought it back to 13.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.420]   So I think we should simplify things.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.740]   This Utah law, honestly, it's too complicated.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.680]   A time limit on when people of certain ages
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.900]   can use different types of technologies.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.020]   I don't even know if this is a legitimate proposal
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.980]   or it's just trying to motion towards you,
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.340]   signal that you care about this issue,
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.100]   but this is way too complicated.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.380]   If you wanna do something legislatively here,
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.220]   take the law that already exists,
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.180]   go back to the original age.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.300]   It's 16, not 13.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.700]   We don't have to invent new mechanisms.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.540]   We don't have to do things at the state level.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.140]   In general, I'm wary of legislative solutions
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:44.960]   to a lot of these issues
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.140]   because not that I don't think they're issues
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:47.980]   that need to be solved,
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.300]   but I've never seen progress made.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.260]   They're very difficult issues to actually legislate.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.300]   But this is a case where there's something simple
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.300]   that could be done.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:57.020]   Change the age net law to 16.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.860]   Now, one of the pushbacks about doing that,
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.500]   and it shows up in this article I have here,
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.180]   one of the pushbacks is, yeah, but you can't enforce that.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:07.700]   You know, kids under the age of 13
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.380]   still sign up for social media accounts.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.180]   My argument to that is that's not a problem right now.
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.100]   What do we wanna do?
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.420]   Why would we want a law that says you need to be 16
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.740]   to sign up for a social media account?
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.580]   Why would we want that law?
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.340]   To prevent anyone from under the age of 16
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.180]   ever getting on that account?
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.460]   No, what we wanna do is give some help and protection
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.620]   to these poor parents who had the misfortune
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:33.060]   of having kids in the '90s in such a way that these,
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:36.220]   or in the 2000s, such that these kids are coming of age
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.780]   just as this new technology,
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.100]   social media and smartphones just arose.
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.780]   So they have full access to these technologies,
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:44.220]   but we haven't had enough time yet to digest culturally
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.740]   how we actually wanna deal with these
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.300]   and figure out how kids could use it.
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.940]   So we have this 10 year gap, this 10 year window
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.340]   where people are being subject to a giant public experiment
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.820]   of just good luck.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.100]   Here's a phone, like 12 year old, I hope you do okay.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.140]   And of course I think in the future, this is gonna change.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.980]   We're learning more about this, but right now,
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.460]   the parents of these kids need all the help they can get.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.100]   It is very difficult to turn to your 14 year old and say,
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.500]   "I don't want you on a smartphone doing social media."
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.300]   And they say, "All my friends have it.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.700]   You are gonna make me be socially outcast."
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.260]   These parents need support.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.700]   And what better way to push back when your kid says,
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.500]   "But all my friends are doing it,"
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.700]   than to say, "It's illegal."
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.260]   This is why you can't have TikTok 14 year old daughter,
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.500]   'cause it's illegal.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.700]   And now the teens are in a place where they have to say,
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.940]   "I know, but we should break the law."
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.260]   And they know that's not gonna go over well.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.900]   Now, here's what happens.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.620]   This allows a lot of parents to hold the line.
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.940]   If a lot of parents hold the line,
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.980]   then when you get to your middle school classroom,
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.500]   there is a large contingent of kids
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   who don't have phones and access to social media.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.420]   No, it's not 100%, forget 100%.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.900]   What we need is just enough of those kids in the classroom,
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.740]   not on social media,
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.500]   that if you are feeling particularly harmed by this,
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.580]   if seeing all the sort of mean performative demonstration
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.940]   of the things that you're missing out on,
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.500]   the things where the teenage girls you know,
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.380]   know that you weren't invited to this party
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.220]   and find a nonsense reason
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.420]   to send you an Instagram story about it.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.820]   And they have some nonsense reason like,
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.380]   "Hey, look, there's that dress you were talking about.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.220]   Someone is wearing it."
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.060]   And the real reason they're doing it
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.060]   is so you can see that you weren't invited to this party.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.860]   When you can opt out of that,
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.220]   you have covered up out of that because some people do.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.020]   Not everyone, but there's a sizable contingent that does.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.140]   And now you can join that contingent if you really need it.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.060]   The people who are having the most trouble with this
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.420]   have social cover to walk away from these technologies.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.980]   That makes a huge difference.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.820]   And so I think right now,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.580]   we need to give ammunition to parents
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:41.420]   to be able to enforce certain restrictions
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.740]   that they are seeing everyday evidence
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.340]   of what helped the mental wellbeing of their kids.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.660]   And so if we made this official federal age 16,
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.420]   no, we're not going to eliminate all social media use
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.700]   from all kids, but that's okay.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.020]   It's gonna give cover to the parents
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.340]   who see this as a problem.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.420]   It's gonna give cover to the kids
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.580]   who are exhausted of this,
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.300]   but can't be the only person who's not on the services.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.500]   So I'm increasingly coming around to this idea
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.580]   of let's start with what's simple.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.540]   There's a couple simple changes we can make right now
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.740]   that would probably go a long way
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.300]   in the helping the mental health of teens.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.340]   But I am glad that a lot of people are thinking about this.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.700]   And I do find it amusing
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.660]   that this issue crosses the partisan lines.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.180]   I find it amusing to watch the online commentators
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.780]   have their head start spinning around
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.540]   and then the cartoon steam comes out of their ears
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.820]   'cause they're not sure who they're supposed to be mad at.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820]   So that's also entertaining,
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.700]   but there's a serious problem here
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:29.580]   and I'm glad other people
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.500]   are finally starting to recognize that.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.540]   So there you go, Jesse.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.460]   Kids and social media.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.540]   I have to give a whole talk about this
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.500]   at my kids' school soon.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.820]   - Yeah, you were saying that we'll do a video on it.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.740]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   So it's coming up.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.220]   It got postponed for various reasons,
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.980]   but after I give that talk, I'll record a video version
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.940]   unless it goes terribly.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.660]   So we'll see how it goes first.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.780]   If my kids are kicked out of that school
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:59.100]   due to the general intellectual and moral degeneracy
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.140]   of their father as based on his talk,
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.580]   then I won't record a version of it.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.260]   (Jesse laughs)
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.300]   Me and my idea of the first 20 minutes of the talk
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.460]   is let me show you all the worst things
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.020]   I was able to find on social media.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.580]   I just show like picture after picture
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.220]   of just terrible things.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.180]   Now, if the talk goes well,
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.500]   I'll record a version for everyone else.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.260]   All right, speaking of things going well,
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.260]   I think this was a good episode,
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.740]   but we got to wrap things up.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.340]   Thank you everyone who sent in their questions.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.740]   If you want to submit your own questions,

[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.220]   Actually, I'll be back next week, special vacation episode.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.020]   So it'll probably just be me.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.900]   So I'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.700]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.040]   (upbeat music)
