[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820]   The increased hunger seems to be the main reason
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.340]   people find it so difficult to keep weight off.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.140]   - That seems the perfect segue to talk about GLP-1,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.920]   glucagon-like peptide one, ozempic,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.800]   Munjaro, and similar drugs.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.680]   My understanding of the back history on these
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.180]   is that a biologist obsessed with Gila monsters,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.420]   a reptile that doesn't need to eat very often
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.860]   discovered a peptide within their bloodstream
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.860]   called Xtendin that allowed them to eat very seldom,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.040]   curbed appetite in the Gila monster of all things.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.820]   And it has a analog homolog, you know, we don't know.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.720]   I don't know the sequence homology exactly,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.340]   but there's a similar peptide made in mice and in humans
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.660]   that suppresses appetite.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.760]   If you would, could you tell us what is known
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.780]   about how GLP-1 works to suppress appetite?
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.700]   Where in the body and/or brain,
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.900]   and your sort of read of these drugs
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.900]   and what's happening there, good, bad, exciting, ugly.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.140]   - Sure, I'd be happy to.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.960]   - Anything else?
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.460]   - So the story of GLP-1,
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.960]   so the Gila monster is an important turn,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.800]   and I'll talk about that.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   It actually goes back before that quite a ways.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.800]   So I should take a step back and say, you know,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.620]   these were developed as drugs for diabetes, right?
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.500]   And so, and diabetes is a condition
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.420]   where basically you have elevated blood glucose,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.440]   either because you don't produce enough insulin
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.980]   or because your insulin is not effective.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.300]   And so back in sort of the 1920s,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.020]   right around the time insulin was discovered,
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.340]   there was this phenomenon discovered
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.820]   known as the increten effect.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.100]   And what it was-
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.940]   - Increten?
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.760]   - Increten, yeah.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.600]   - Not the creten effect.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440]   - Not the creten effect.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.740]   - You can observe the creten effect
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.260]   in numerous places in daily life and online.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.100]   Just kidding.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980]   - So it's called the increten effect.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.940]   You can think of it as increase insulin,
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.640]   'cause that's what the effect is.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.600]   And the idea was that if you take glucose by mouth,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.120]   if you consume glucose orally,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.920]   versus if you have the same amount of glucose
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   injected intravenously,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.340]   more insulin is produced when you take the glucose orally
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.200]   versus if it's delivered intravenously.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.400]   Suggesting something about the process
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.480]   of ingesting the glucose causes more insulin to be released
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   and causes you to lower your body sugar more accurately
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360]   and more strongly.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.440]   - Interesting.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.720]   - Which is a little bit counterintuitive
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.200]   because in the pancreas, right?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.440]   So insulin is released from the pancreas,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   from the beta cell.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.920]   The pancreas senses the glucose concentration
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.760]   in the blood directly.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   And so it suggests that insulin is being released
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.580]   not just in response to changes in blood glucose,
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.160]   but in response to a second factor.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.560]   And so they call that an incretin.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.160]   And through various experiments,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.600]   it was shown that this incretin effect
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.520]   comes from the intestine.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.560]   That there's some substance being produced by the intestine
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.720]   that when you eat a meal,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.400]   sugar goes through your intestine
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.360]   that boosts this insulin response to glucose in the blood.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.500]   And people immediately realized
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.960]   this could potentially be very valuable.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.060]   And the reason is that you can treat diabetes
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.200]   with insulin injections, but insulin is dangerous, right?
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.320]   'Cause if you inject too much insulin,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.420]   you can kill yourself by making yourself hypoglycemic, right?
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.480]   So you have to be very careful.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.840]   But the thing about the incretin effect is
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.800]   it's not causing insulin release directly,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   but it's rather boosting the natural insulin release
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.440]   that comes when your glucose is higher in your blood.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.580]   So it's sort of an amplifier
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.740]   on the natural insulin release.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.960]   So basically in the years that followed,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.840]   whenever someone would find a new hormone,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.680]   they would test it.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520]   Is it this incretin?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.480]   And there's lots of failures.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.760]   They weren't the incretin.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.480]   But then, so there's this other hormone
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.360]   that comes from the pancreas called glucagon, right?
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.080]   And so glucagon, it was also discovered in the 1920s.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240]   Glucagon is kind of the anti-insulin.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.880]   So when blood sugar goes low,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.920]   glucagon is released in order to cause your liver
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   to release glucose into the blood.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.560]   So glucagon and insulin are these two opposing hormones.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.720]   Glucagon was known for a long time,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.520]   but people discovered in sort of the 1980s
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.720]   that the glucagon gene is expressed in other tissues
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.340]   other than the pancreas.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.100]   And it's differentially processed.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.660]   The protein is differentially processed
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.760]   to produce different hormones,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.800]   hormones other than glucagon.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.480]   And they discovered there was one in the intestine.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.400]   And so they called it glucagon-like peptide
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.160]   because it comes from the same gene,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.360]   but it's just slightly different.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.800]   It's cut up slightly differently.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.240]   And this hormone wasn't incretin.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.840]   So basically if you put it on beta cells,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.640]   you get this increased response of insulin
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.840]   in response to glucose.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.600]   And so there was the idea,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.280]   okay, this could be a great diabetes drug, right?
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   And I should say there was one other incretin
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.160]   that's been found.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   It's called GIP, G-I-P.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.480]   And that will be important
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.600]   in talking about some of these other drugs.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.400]   Also a hormone that comes from the intestine.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.120]   And so the challenge with making GLP-1 into a drug
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   is that it has an extremely short half-life.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   So it has a half-life of about two minutes in the blood.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.440]   And so even if you inject people with GLP-1,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.840]   it won't really be useful for anything.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.760]   You don't decrease appetite,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.840]   you don't affect blood sugar 'cause it's just degraded
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.320]   too fast.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.200]   And the reason it's degraded is because there's an enzyme,
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   DPP-4 is what it's called, that degrades GLP-1.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.080]   So the first thing people tried was let's make inhibitors
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.480]   of that enzyme so we can boost this natural GLP-1 signal.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.200]   And those are approved diabetes drugs.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.040]   They're called gliptins.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.880]   You've probably heard about them.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.800]   Genuvia is the most common one.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.480]   And those boost the level of GLP-1,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.760]   the natural GLP-1 produced from the intestine
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.080]   by about threefold.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.900]   And they're effective in treating diabetes.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.140]   - Do people lose weight?
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.800]   - People do not lose weight.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.640]   - Interesting.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.640]   - And that's one of the key reasons that we know
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.320]   the natural function of GLP-1
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.880]   is not really to control body weight
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.680]   because you can boost the level threefold
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.660]   with these DPP-4 drugs.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.720]   Millions of people have taken them.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.960]   They do not lose weight.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.520]   That's a great question.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.800]   So, but a threefold is great,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.440]   but you'd like to increase it even more, right?
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.500]   And to do that, you can't block this enzyme.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.080]   You have to actually produce a GLP-1
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.280]   that is more stable in the blood.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.840]   And that's where this lizard that you mentioned
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.320]   comes into play.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.160]   It produces a stabilized form of GLP-1 and it's a venom.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   No one knows why.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.600]   One hypothesis is that it's something to do with the lizard,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.960]   as you said, basically having this long time period
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.280]   between meals and it needs to regulate its blood glucose.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   Who knows if that is true,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   but it turned out to be fortuitous
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.960]   because then this GLP-1 from this lizard,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.240]   it has a half-life of like two hours.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.480]   And so the first GLP-1 drug that was approved
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.940]   was just this molecule from this lizard, basically.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.940]   And it's called Xenotide and it was approved in 2005.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.400]   Works well for diabetes, has a half-life of two hours.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.660]   You inject it and it doesn't cause a ton of weight loss.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.360]   But two hours is good, but it's not so great.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.640]   So then the pharmaceutical industry tried to say,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.560]   can we basically improve this even further?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   And so they start engineering this hormone,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.640]   making mutations, attaching lipid tails
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.800]   to make it bind to proteins in the blood
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   that would stabilize it.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.760]   - Chemistry jockey stuff.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   And I think the next big advance
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.360]   was this compound liraglutide.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.020]   And liraglutide was approved for diabetes in 2010
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.440]   and then for weight loss in 2014.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.560]   And so liraglutide has a half-life
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.400]   of about 13 hours in the blood.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   Now you're getting up to something serious.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.000]   We've gone from two minutes, two hours, 13 hours.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.720]   And you get better effects on aspects of blood glucose
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   and diabetes control.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.080]   And they started to see that some people were losing weight.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.120]   Very variable responses.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.760]   Not everyone loses weight on liraglutide.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.000]   And one of the things they noticed
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   that I think is just as fascinating
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.880]   just sort of example of how drug discovery works
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.780]   in the real world.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.360]   You know, a lot of these people would take liraglutide.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.000]   Now it has this longer half-life.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.400]   They'll start to get nauseous.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.360]   And that would limit how much
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.520]   of the liraglutide they could take.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   And it's a known side effect of these GLP-1 drugs.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.000]   It causes nausea and sort of this gastrointestinal distress.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.840]   But they noticed that over time,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.480]   the nausea would just sort of go away.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.280]   And so they would start dose escalating,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.320]   sort of raising the dose that the person would take.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.520]   So you would go, you know, a month at this dose,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   and then a month at a slightly higher dose,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.520]   and then a month at a slightly higher dose.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.920]   And you could work your way up.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.560]   And these side effects would reappear,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   but then they'd go away.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.360]   And then once you got up to the highest doses,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.720]   then people really started losing weight.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   And so there's a couple of things
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.560]   that our pharmaceutical industry realized,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400]   wow, these are potentially
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.240]   really effective weight loss drugs.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.720]   And also this nausea, which we thought was a killer,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.200]   people are able to just get used to it,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.160]   and then it just goes away.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.840]   It undergoes, the word is tachyphylaxis.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   So the idea is that the receptor that's affecting,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.760]   in the gut that's causing these effects,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.640]   it undergoes some sort of down regulation
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.120]   with chronic exposure.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.320]   So liraglutide, you know, it's been around,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.760]   you know, it's been on the market for 14 years now,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.200]   was used, but still you're only getting
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   sort of like seven to 10% weight loss,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.020]   which is good, but not like, you know, amazing, impressive.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.880]   But then semaglutide came along.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.920]   And that was approved for diabetes in 2017.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.600]   And semaglutide is ozempic,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   or also marketed as Wigovi for weight loss.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.720]   And semaglutide now has a half-life of seven days.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   So now we've gone from two minutes,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.880]   two hours, 13 hours, seven days.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.640]   And you can really jack up the concentration
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.560]   with a seven-day half-life.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.800]   And then they saw people start really losing weight.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.560]   And so in some of those trials,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.680]   people lost, you know, 16% of their body weight,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.440]   which previously had been unattainable.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.980]   - In what timeframe?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.680]   - Typically takes about a year.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   - Okay, and most of the loss in body weight
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.840]   is from body fat or from other compartments?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000]   - The typical number is that if you lose weight,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.940]   either through dieting or through taking one of these drugs,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.880]   and you don't do anything like eat a high-protein diet
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.600]   or do resistance training,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.760]   somewhere between 25 and 33% of what you lose
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.880]   is gonna be muscle.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.040]   The rest is gonna be fat.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.020]   - But as you said, some of that could be offset
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.560]   by resistance training and/or consuming
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.880]   a higher-protein diet.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.760]   - Yeah, you can almost completely eliminate that
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.840]   if you eat enough protein and do serious weightlifting.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.400]   Obviously, not the whole population
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.360]   is interested in doing that.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.080]   And there's been a lot of discussion
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.100]   of how serious a side effect this is.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.400]   You know, among elderly people,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.920]   you don't wanna be losing muscle mass
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.080]   because you're already losing so much muscle mass.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.600]   On the other hand, the counterargument that has been made,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   which I think is also kind of convincing,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.960]   is that, true, you're losing some muscle,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.660]   but you're also losing all this fat,
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.880]   and you no longer need as much muscle
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   when you're not carrying around as much body fat.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.820]   So people who are heavier naturally have more muscle
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.400]   because they need to to move their body, right?
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.160]   And so- - Yeah, the calves
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.200]   on very obese people are often enormous.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.020]   - Exactly. - And then they lose weight.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.240]   - Exactly. - And I mentioned the calves
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   in particular because they're carrying
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.360]   a lot of the body load.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.200]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.680]   So it's still an open question as to how serious a problem
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.480]   this lean muscle mass loss is,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.040]   although the pharmaceutical industry is all in now
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.900]   on making drugs that basically are gonna prevent that.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.800]   So that's something that will be happening
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.840]   probably in the future.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.200]   - Is it a, sorry to interrupt,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.840]   but is the weight loss on these drugs
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.360]   the consequence of reduced appetite
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.380]   or some other aspect of metabolism?
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.440]   And if it's the consequence of reduced appetite,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.000]   is that occurring at the level of the brain and gut
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.920]   or a combination?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.320]   - So it's almost entirely reduced appetite,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920]   and it's almost entirely occurring
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.080]   at the level of the brain.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.960]   - Which neurons?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.560]   - It's thought that the key targets of these drugs
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.760]   are neurons in these two regions.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.440]   One's called the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.200]   and the other one's called the area post-trauma.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.480]   - So we're back in the brainstem.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.600]   - Back in the brainstem.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.080]   So these are actually the neurons
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.920]   in that decerebrate rat story I was telling earlier.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.620]   These are the brain regions that are preserved
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.480]   in the decerebrate rat.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.560]   The decerebrate rat still has
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.800]   these very caudal brainstem structures.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.280]   They're two very special brain regions
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.400]   because they get direct input from the vagus nerve.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.720]   So the vagus nerve is the nerve that innervates your stomach
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.760]   and intestines and heart and lungs,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.000]   and it's sort of the major pathway from gut to brain.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.600]   It provides most of the neural input from gut to brain,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.480]   telling you about things like your stomach distention,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   how many nutrients are in your intestine,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.280]   breathing, all that stuff.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   And almost all of those vagal nerves
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.280]   terminate on these two structures in the brainstem.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.760]   - When I hear post-trauma, I think about nausea
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.860]   because I was taught that post-trauma contains neurons
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.600]   that can stimulate vomiting.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.960]   And this seems to link up well,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.160]   at least in the logical sense,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.720]   with the idea that stimulating, activating receptors
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.680]   in these neurons within post-trauma
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.320]   might explain part of the transient nausea side effect
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.400]   of ozempic and related drugs.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.920]   - Yeah, so the current thought is that a lot of the nausea
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.360]   is coming from activating the neurons
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.520]   in the area of post-trauma,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.060]   and that a lot of the sort of physiologic satiety
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.680]   is coming from activating the neurons
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.400]   in the nucleus of the solitary tract.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.800]   Now, the whole brain is connected to each other,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.400]   and so if you really turn on these neurons
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.000]   in the NTS and the AP, they're gonna talk
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.640]   to the hypothalamus and all these other brain regions,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.080]   it's gonna change the whole brain.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   So it's not just those regions,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.800]   but these drugs don't have great access to the brain.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.200]   They can penetrate a little bit into the brain,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.080]   but they don't penetrate into the whole brain.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.080]   And it's thought that if you take
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.440]   fluorescently labeled versions of these drugs
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.080]   and see where do they, so you can visualize
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.340]   where do they actually go,
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.280]   they're enriched in these structures in the brainstem.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.240]   So that's why people think
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.040]   that this is probably where they're acting.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.080]   - And is that because there's an abundance
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   of the receptors for these compounds in post-trauma and NTS,
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.880]   or is it because the blood-brain barrier
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.320]   is somehow weaker at that location?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.880]   - It's because the blood-brain barrier is weaker.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.440]   So basically, it's a region,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.880]   what's known as a circumventricular organ,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.120]   meaning it's one of these rare places in the brain
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.640]   where the blood-brain barrier is weakened,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.920]   and so substances can come from the outside into the brain.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.760]   And that's important for these big peptides,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.920]   'cause these are not small molecules.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.760]   These are big peptides with lipid chains on them
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.600]   and other things.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.040]   And so they can really only get into areas of the brain
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.960]   where the blood-brain barrier is weakened.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.840]   - Thank you for tuning in
