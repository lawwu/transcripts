[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   All right, we want to pick up where we left off in our last class period, and that has
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   to do with the goals of Christian marriage and the family counseling.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   What should those goals be?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:33.700]   Now it's amazing to me how many pastors and just general Christian people don't understand
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.240]   the importance of goals in the scripture.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.160]   I want to take just a little bit of time and kind of highlight some of that.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400]   Why is it that we must have goals?
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.920]   That's not a secular idea, that's a godly idea.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   Goals are nothing but ideas about how we want to achieve something that we're going about
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   to achieve.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.300]   What are our goals?
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.800]   Sometimes we'll have intermediate goals, and sometimes we'll have long-term goals, but
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   what should they be, and is it proper for us as pastors or as counselors to have goals
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.760]   in marriage and family counseling?
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   The answer is absolutely yes.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   Let me explain to you why.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   If you have your Bible, grab it, and let's go over to Proverbs chapter 14, and we're
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.720]   interested in verse 8, Proverbs 14 and verse 8.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.520]   Solomon here says, "The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to his ways."
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.560]   The word for prudent there in the Hebrew can also be translated sensible.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.400]   The wisdom of the sensible is to give thought to his ways, and in fact, it actually, the
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:03.520]   root idea behind that word sensible or prudent is literally the Hebrew idea of naked.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:21.040]   A person who was prudent was naked, in a sense fully exposed, but also sensible.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.560]   The wisdom of the naked is to give understanding or thought to his way, but the foolishness
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.800]   of fools is deceit.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:40.520]   A fool will not give thought to his ways, but a truly sensible person who's not covering
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:53.040]   over for any pretense will give thought to their ways, in other words, they'll set goals.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.160]   Go over to Proverbs chapter 16 and verse 9, "The mind of the man plans his way, but the
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.400]   Lord directs his steps."
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   Now God is not chiding people who plan their ways.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.840]   He's not saying it's wrong to do that, but he is saying that God is sovereign over all
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.800]   that man does, and you can plan your ways, and you can set your goals, but God's going
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.480]   to redirect your paths.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.000]   When you carefully prepare for your next counseling session with somebody, you may have an idea
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.440]   of where you want to go in scripture, but they may come to the counseling session with
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.280]   something that's happened, maybe a crisis event or something that's occurred in the
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.000]   family, and it may totally redirect your entire course of your counsel, and you've got to
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.600]   be flexible enough to follow that.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.960]   But the bottom line here is that God is going to be sovereign, and he's going to overrule
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.480]   what we plan.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   That's okay.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.320]   As long as you anticipate that, you're fine, nothing wrong.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.120]   But it's also not wrong to plan your way either.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.360]   You've got to do that so you know where you're going.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.840]   More often than not, when you do that, usually the way that you've planned to go is the way
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.680]   that that'll end up going.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.360]   You've heard that old saying, "If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail," and that's
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.040]   true.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.560]   That's just a little proverb or a contemporary proverb that illustrates the fact that people
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.800]   who do not like to plan or set goals in their life are really setting themselves up ultimately
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.680]   for failure.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.520]   But God says it's the prudent man who gives thought to his ways.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.480]   You can plan your ways, but God can overrule them.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.880]   Then if you go to chapter 16 of Proverbs in verse 1, you can see this there as well.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.080]   Proverbs 16 in verse 1, he says, "To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.360]   comes the reply of the tongue."
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.800]   I can plan certain things, I can intend certain things in this sense, but ultimately the Lord
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.220]   directs what's really going to happen again.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.440]   Or there's Proverbs 10 in verse 5, "He who gathers crops in the summer is a wise son,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.760]   but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son."
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.640]   So the idea is you've got to plan to gather your crops in the summertime.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.000]   If you're lazy and you're not diligent, and there are some people who do counseling who
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.720]   are very lazy, they're not diligent at making good plans, then you're not going to eat,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.480]   is the implication of this proverb, you're not going to be successful.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.740]   God says that kind of a son is a disgraceful son because he's sleeping, he's not diligent,
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.840]   he's lazy, he's a sluggard in that sense.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   Then go over to Proverbs 13 in verse 16, here Solomon says, "Every prudent man acts with
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   knowledge, but a fool displays his folly."
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.640]   So when you act, you act from the standpoint of knowledge, that implies planning as well.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.840]   You've got to plan your ways.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:29.800]   Or Proverbs 20 in verse 18, "Make plans by seeking advice, if you wage war, obtain guidance."
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.660]   If you wage war, obtain guidance.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.640]   So you've got to plan ahead again, is the idea behind this.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:49.200]   Or there's Proverbs 24 in verse 27, here Solomon says, "Prepare your work outside, make it
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.720]   ready for yourself in the field afterwards, then build your house."
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.560]   Now what's implied by that proverb is you've got to plan ahead, that is work outside, make
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.920]   it ready for yourself in your field, in other words, prepare your fields first, then build
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   your house.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.760]   Because you can build your house any time of the year, but you can only plant a certain
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.880]   time of the year.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   So what are you going to prioritize?
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.760]   I've got to prioritize planting my field first, then I'm going to build my house.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.440]   Sleep outside until you get those fields planted, then let the fields grow while you're building
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.060]   your house.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.960]   But prioritize planting your fields.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.600]   You've got to prioritize certain things in counseling as well.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Or then again, there's Romans chapter 1, verses 9 through 13.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:47.480]   So this brings us into the New Testament, and here Paul is dealing with the Roman church.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:55.760]   Verse 9 he says, "For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.000]   his Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.120]   making requests, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.120]   you.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.160]   For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you that you may be
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.240]   established.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.800]   That is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.000]   other's faith, both yours and mine.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.200]   I do not want you to become unaware, brethren, but often I have planned to come to you and
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.080]   have been prevented so far so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even among the
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.700]   rest of the Gentiles."
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:38.280]   So Paul talks about his ministry to them as a Roman church and his repeated plans.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.400]   He set goals to come and see them, but God prevented that from happening.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.420]   So again, God overrules those plans sometimes in life.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.400]   He's done that probably several times in your life.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.280]   He's overruled some of the plans, the expectations that you've had and you thought you were going
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.320]   one way and God sent you on another direction.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.040]   Back several months ago, my wife and I were planning the fall and I had certain speaking
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.400]   activities that I had planned for and certain churches that wanted me to come in and do
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.480]   a conference or to speak and so we were planning those and setting all that up and setting
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720]   the airline arrangements and et cetera.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.360]   In some cases, they had my wife coming with me.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.180]   One of the recent ones, in fact, one where I was supposed to go to Iowa, my wife got
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.400]   a notice three days before we were supposed to leave that she was responsible to go to
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.560]   jury duty.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.160]   She thought, "Well, maybe I'll go to jury duty and they'll kick me off and I won't have
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   to go."
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.480]   Well, no, they didn't.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.620]   They kept her on for two or three days and so she ended up missing the entire weekend.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:54.520]   She was supposed to speak to a group of women, so that left me speaking to them.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:02.500]   So we can plan our ways and it's not bad that we do, but then we realize that God can redirect
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.120]   our steps.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:11.200]   By the way, after that weekend was over with, on Monday, finally, she was dismissed from
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   the jury.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   She didn't have to serve.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.700]   That's wonderful because we had other plans weekends after that.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.000]   If she would have been placed on that jury, it was such a serious case that probably she
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.900]   would have been on it for several weeks and we would have missed several different airline
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.300]   tickets and all of that money would have been spent for nothing.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:40.560]   So Paul said, "I plan to come to see you as Roman Christians, but I was prevented from
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.080]   doing so," but that didn't stop him from planning.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.860]   That's my point.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.140]   He set a goal and he planned to do it and it didn't stop him.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.460]   Let's go over to Colossians 1 and verse 28.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.060]   This is a great verse, especially for people who do counseling because you notice how counseling
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.820]   was so central to the ministry of Paul.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.020]   He describes his goal in counseling.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.940]   What does he strive to do?
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:13.400]   He says, "We proclaim him," speaking of Christ, "Christ with the center of his counsel and
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:19.660]   his teaching, admonishing every man," and that word admonish is our Greek term, "nouthateo,"
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:26.000]   "admonishing every man, teaching every man with all wisdom that we may present every
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.780]   man complete in Christ."
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.560]   There's his goal.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.000]   The emphasis is not preaching to congregations in this verse, the emphasis is upon the ministry
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.380]   of the word of God to individual people.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.460]   Every man, every man, every man, that's repeated here.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.440]   Verse 29, he says, "For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power which
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.360]   so mightily works within me."
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.800]   So it's God's power who is at work.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:05.360]   So God, it was very appropriate for the apostle Paul to plan and set goals for his personal
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.680]   ministry of the word of God.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:18.760]   Ephesians 1, verse 17, here we see this in Paul's life again, Ephesians 1, verse 17.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.380]   He says that, "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.160]   of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him."
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.080]   And then, in other words, you can see that that is part of his prayer, that's what he
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.680]   desired for them, that's the goal that he had for them.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.520]   Then you go over to chapter 3 and verse 14, he says, "For this reason I bow my knees before
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.480]   the Father from whom every family in heaven and earth derives his name, that he would
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.840]   grant you according to his riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through the
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.000]   Holy Spirit in the inner man.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.120]   So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you may, being rooted and grounded
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.720]   in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.400]   and the height and the depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses the knowledge
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.280]   that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God."
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.040]   This was his goal for them, that's what he desired, he set that as this goal.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.560]   The purpose of his ministry was that this would happen in their lives, that was a goal
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   that he set.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:32.720]   All right, we can see this also if you go back to the Gospels in Luke chapter 19 and
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.000]   verse 10.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.360]   Jesus says, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.720]   Jesus had a goal, he wanted to seek and save that which is lost.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:56.200]   You can see the same thing in the Gospel of John in verse 17 and verse 4.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   Jesus is speaking again, he says, "I glorified you on the earth having accomplished the work
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.000]   which you have given me to do."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.320]   God gave Christ his goals, his purposes for coming to the earth and Christ accomplished
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.160]   everything that God gave him to do.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.040]   Now you're beginning to get a sense at this particular point and we could go on and on
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.080]   and on and use many other references but the point is this, planning and setting goals
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   for what you do in order to accomplish things for God is very important and it's no less
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   important in counseling.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.120]   In counseling you've got to set goals, where am I going to go this next counseling session?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:53.760]   Sometimes when I supervise counselees who are in training or counselors who are in training,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.120]   I ask them the question, "What are your goals for the next session?
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   What do you want to do in this next session?
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   Where do you want to go?
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   Where do you want to take them?
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.040]   What do you want to do with them?"
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   Now why?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.720]   What are some of the benefits and usefulness of goals for marriage and family counseling?
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Well, when you have good goals and good planning, it's useful for planning what to do and not
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.240]   to do.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:38.080]   It's useful for planning what to do, not to do and what to look for, we would say.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.160]   I remember a woman that came in for counseling.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.240]   She had been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with manic depression, sometimes referred to as
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:53.600]   bipolar disorder, and she wanted to know from me whether or not she should be on medication
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.240]   for her problem.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:04.440]   Well, I told her, "Listen, I'm not a physician, but there are two things I do know.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:16.240]   The Bible teaches us that some depression can be caused by organic disorders.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.400]   There are actually legitimate illnesses that can cause depression-like symptoms.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.900]   So you need to be checked out physiologically to make sure that you don't have a legitimate
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.940]   organic disorder.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.240]   In some cases, if you have a tumor and the tumor is pressing on the wrong portion of
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.680]   the brain, it can cause depression-like symptoms.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   That's a tumor.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.500]   That's a legitimate organic problem.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:53.760]   But I also know, the Bible tells us, that some depression can be caused by wrong or
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:01.040]   inaccurate thinking or living along with our emotional reactions to that thinking or living,
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.920]   which causes us to be depressed.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.760]   Now that, at that particular point, ceases to be a physiological problem and now becomes
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.160]   a spiritual problem, and that is something that I can help you with.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.880]   Even if it is an organic problem, I can help you with the spiritual dimension of dealing
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   with it.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.740]   If you do have a tumor, we can talk about how does the Word of God talk about dealing
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:29.200]   with physical illnesses, but if it's not a physiological problem, then the issue becomes
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:36.480]   what is the root of this, what in your thinking and in your desiring and in your cravings
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.880]   in life brought about this particular depression.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.600]   I can help you look at the latter and compare these with what God says you can do and what
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.000]   He expects from you.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.880]   I can help you to do that.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   So if you have certain goals in counseling, you know what to do and what not to do, and
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.560]   you know what to look for in people's lives.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:10.820]   Secondly, these goals also are useful for evaluating progress.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.560]   Are we moving along?
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.900]   That's important for the counselee to have a sense of moving somewhere.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.040]   Are we going somewhere in the counseling?
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.900]   If your counselee doesn't have a sense that you're moving in a direction, they'll lose
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.900]   hope.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.900]   They'll become discouraged.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.980]   Thirdly, they're also useful for a sense of confidence and confidence in the counselee
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:42.800]   as he or she is growing.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:53.560]   There's a girl that came for counseling, in this case for depression.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.640]   After receiving the counseling, eventually she graduated out from the counseling, went
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.880]   back into her normal life, started implementing what the Bible had to say about it.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.660]   Several months went by and then I got another call from this particular gal and she came
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:18.480]   for further help for the same depression.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.360]   When she came back, I said to her, "Listen, I'm not going to talk with you about this
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.880]   depression anymore because you know what to do."
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.320]   Remember all those notes I had you take during the time that you went through counseling?
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   "Do you still have those notes?"
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   "Yes, I do."
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   "Where are they?"
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   "Well, they're in a box.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   I put them away."
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   "Why?"
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:44.480]   "Because you now, and you saw relief, you saw help that the Word of God had for you,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.680]   you now need to go back to those notes and re-implement until it becomes habituated in
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.160]   your life the same things that we talked about.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.800]   I don't need to counsel you anymore.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.960]   You have the capacity and all the information you need to counsel yourself.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   You can do this.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.080]   You don't have to rely upon me any longer."
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.460]   So if you have good goals in counseling, that'll help to build some confidence and confidence
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.300]   in your counselee as they are growing too.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.280]   So she was able to look back and say, "Yeah, you know, you're right.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.160]   I shouldn't have to come back to you every time I have this experience in my life.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:28.300]   What I should be able to do is open the Word of God and diagnose my own problem.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.520]   What am I thinking that's wrong?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.080]   And then deal with that.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.520]   Repent of it.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.040]   And then head in the right direction.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.240]   Do what God wants me to do."
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:48.120]   Fourth, good goals also are useful for sustaining momentum.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.480]   In other words, success breeds success.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.160]   Sustaining momentum.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.520]   When you and your counselee realize, "Hey, you're making progress.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.660]   Things have changed.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.080]   They're not the same person that they were when they first came to counseling.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.160]   They're better.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.780]   They know how to resolve problems better.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.780]   They may be...
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.600]   They're not out of the woods, but you can sure see the edge of the woods."
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.200]   A lot better now.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.620]   It's useful for sustaining momentum in counseling.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.840]   Have good goals.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:26.920]   What kind of goals do you have for your counselee?
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.760]   Number nine, or number five, I should say.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.280]   Number five.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:39.080]   They're also useful for keeping you on track as weeks progress and turn into months.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.280]   This is so you don't get lost in the details yourself.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.880]   That is, sometimes you feel like you're putting out fires on a week-to-week basis.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.760]   Like the firemen here in Southern California.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:57.280]   When all those big fires rush through the Angeles National Forest with all that chaparral
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.520]   and brush that burns up and the smoke, well, weeks after those fires are supposedly put
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.880]   out, they still have these hot spots that could easily reignite again.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.640]   You find yourself running all over the place putting these hot spots out.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   Very similar thing can happen in counseling.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.080]   One day I described it.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   I was sitting down with a group of pastors and we were talking about this various thing.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.840]   I said, "Counseling sometimes it's like you're sitting in front of a great big board.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.440]   Have you ever seen one of those sound boards with all the knobs on them?"
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.680]   Only these are the kind of knobs that pop up.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.800]   One of them pops up over here and you push it down.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.880]   Another one pops up over here and you push that one down.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.520]   Another one pops up in the middle and you push that one down.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:42.820]   You feel like all you're doing is just putting out fires on a week-to-week basis in counseling.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.600]   That's because you're allowing the counselee and the individual little things that happen
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.040]   on a week-to-week basis to run your counseling.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.880]   You're not allowing your goals to run your counseling.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.360]   If you're setting broader goals, it doesn't mean you ignore those fires.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.820]   You address them, but you quickly get right back on path to the overall progress you're
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.560]   trying to make.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.280]   That's what you're trying to do.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.560]   You're getting back on path, sustaining some kind of progress, especially as the weeks
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.160]   progress and turn into months of counseling.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.120]   You want to get back on path.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:32.800]   Number six, good goals also are very useful for saving time.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.840]   If you don't know where you're going in the counseling, you will waste a lot of precious
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.780]   time.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:47.240]   Your counselee will soon get the idea that we're really not going anywhere and that this
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.960]   is a futile activity.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:58.480]   He'll come to the conclusion that the author of Ecclesiastes comes to.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   Have all havalim, futility of futilities.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.480]   It's all futility.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   Meaningless, meaningless.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.480]   It's all meaningless.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.560]   Vanity, vanity.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   It's all vanity.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.600]   Soap bubbles, soap bubbles.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   It's also bubbles.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.280]   This is useless.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.840]   Absolutely useless.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.160]   Have all havalim.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.920]   This is meaningless.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.960]   Meaningless of meaningless.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.200]   So we don't want that to happen.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.360]   If you have good goals, it will save you time.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.340]   Number seven, it's also useful for securing cooperation and participation.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.880]   What I mean by that is that if your counselees understand the overall goals that you have,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.920]   then they're more motivated to do their homework and to do it well.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:55.720]   And also, they will not lose hope as quickly if they understand that you have a clear biblical
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.680]   goal in mind.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   It's very easy in their sinful depravity, in their struggle with this particular problem
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   to lose hope.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.080]   And you've got to realize that.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:19.120]   And in order to help them hold on to the hope that you hopefully have yourself so diligently
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:30.160]   ministered to them, you've got to constantly remind them of the progress that they're making.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.200]   Constantly remind them of the goals that you've set.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.040]   Keep their eyes on that goal.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.800]   Because the homework you give them, from their perspective, may be difficult, may be hard.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:51.720]   They may want to give up with that kind of homework, but you can't let them do that.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:26:00.040]   Because you're not giving them that homework just to keep them busy.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.200]   That's not your purpose.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:09.840]   You're giving them that homework in order to encourage change on a daily basis in their
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.080]   life.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.140]   That's why you're giving them that homework.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.280]   Courage change.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.080]   To show them that counseling is not the magic hour of the week.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.200]   There are some people who think that.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.240]   I'm coming to counseling.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   It's the magic hour.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.040]   That's where all of a sudden God really works and really changes me.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.540]   No, counseling is not the magic hour of the week.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.000]   Counseling is where I get directions on how to deal with my problems the rest of the week.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.600]   The magic hour is every other hour of the week.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.680]   The magic hour is where I take what I've learned in counseling and I put it into practice.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:55.720]   Counseling is not the magic hour of the week.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.440]   It's funny how many counselees think that.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:05.620]   Because you have some training in counseling, I think they believe that God or maybe seminary
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.780]   equipped you with a bag of spiritual whiffle dust.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.500]   If they come into counseling with all these problems, all you have to do is reach down
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.900]   into your bag of spiritual whiffle dust, grab a whole handful, and throw it on them.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.700]   All their problems go away.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.200]   That's not the way that counseling works at all.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.060]   They have to work at it.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:34.080]   They have to labor diligently in order for those problems to go away.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.020]   They have to change their thinking and their behavior in order for their problems to go
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.840]   away.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:50.780]   Well then, what are some of the characteristics of good goals then?
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:28:00.780]   If we're going to set good goals, then they've got to share some really solid characteristics,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.100]   especially if they're going to be helpful and meaningful goals and they're not just
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:09.620]   going to be arbitrary ones or unrealistic or unreasonable goals.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.980]   Wait until you have children and your children are going through school and your children
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.940]   have certain teachers and the children come home and they're all frustrated over the fact
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.960]   that they believe their teacher has given them an assignment that is beyond their ability.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.020]   Here the teacher has a goal for them, but that particular goal is way beyond their ability
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:35.440]   to be able to handle, or at least they think so.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.180]   Then they don't want to do the assignment.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.980]   So we don't want to set goals that are unrealistic.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.060]   We want to set goals that are very reasonable.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.180]   What are some of the characteristics of these good goals?
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.820]   Well, number one, they have to be shared by the counseling and the counselor.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.500]   They have to be shared.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   It's not enough for you to understand the goals and for your counseling not to.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:06.140]   In fact, I think it's very important they understand them and you're able to explain
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.060]   them to them.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.580]   Let me make a couple of comments about this that I think is really key because most people
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:22.180]   will come to counseling to get relief.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.020]   That's their goal.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.740]   Get me out of my problem.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:38.180]   Now there's a Christian way that people say that and that is they'll say to you, why have
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.220]   you come to counseling?
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.660]   They'll say, "I've come to receive victory over my sin."
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.980]   Now as a pastor, my heart resonates with that.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.100]   Okay, that's good.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.580]   You want to have victory over sin, but what they mean by that and what you're thinking
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.460]   about may be two different things.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.260]   When they say I've come to have victory over my sins, what they mean by that is I want
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.700]   complete liberation from my sin.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.700]   I want complete freedom from my sin.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.060]   I want to be completely relieved from this problem so that it's no longer a temptation
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.620]   ever anymore in my life.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.340]   That may not be God's will.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.540]   There's a wonderful example of that in 2 Corinthians 12 with the Apostle Paul and his thorn in
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   the flesh.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.460]   Paul prayed not once, but three times to have that thorn in the flesh removed.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.980]   What is it that God said?
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.300]   My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:43.940]   Why does God allow this thing to persist in Paul's life even though it was a huge irritant
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.860]   and Paul saw it as a big obstacle to his ministry?
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:55.420]   The answer was because God was using that particular thorn in the flesh to keep Paul
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.900]   humble.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.140]   Sometimes you're going to have young men that will come in and they'll have terrible problems
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:10.020]   with their sexual desires, and maybe things like masturbation.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.780]   That'll be a difficulty for them.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.300]   And they'll come to you and they'll honestly say to you, I want victory over this and what
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.540]   they mean by this is I don't want to be tempted by this anymore.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.660]   Well, you could help them with that.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.740]   You could help them have victory.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.620]   You could just sit them down to the local hospital and the hospital can turn them into
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.980]   a eunuch and they won't have any troubles with that anymore.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.780]   There's not going to be any more temptation left.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.780]   That'll be it.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.660]   That'll be the whole thing.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.820]   But is that what they really want?
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:48.180]   Maybe it is this weakness that's a part of their flesh that God is using to keep them
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.060]   trusting Him.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.980]   It helps them to understand how weak they are.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:59.300]   It keeps their hands clenched tightly in His hand.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.140]   They can't see their way out of this by themselves.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.500]   They have to trust the Lord in this every day.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   So every day this becomes a temptation that they have to fight.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.900]   And in the process of fighting that as Romans chapter 5 and verse 3 says, it's that fight
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.340]   that produces godly character.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:27.820]   So why would you want to remove something that is actually producing godly character
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.340]   in your life?
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.420]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.140]   That's not good.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:41.820]   If God's using that in a positive way to show you your weakness and ultimate helplessness
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.020]   in front of this particular sin, why would you want it removed?
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.540]   Now the issue is, you don't want to succumb to it, that's true.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.780]   I want to learn how to deal with it.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:57.160]   But the temptation, you may not have victory over where it never tempts you ever again.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.540]   This may be something that you struggle with for the rest of your life.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:07.300]   Same thing is true if you end up counseling someone who is a genuine Christian but still
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.820]   has homosexual or lesbian tendencies.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:20.400]   This is something that they may not be able to totally rid themselves of.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.620]   But it is that weakness that they sense in the flesh that keeps them dependent upon Christ.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.260]   So your goal is not victory.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.400]   It's not your goal.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:57.540]   Your goal is faithfulness.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:10.820]   The question is, how do you deal with a young man who has homosexual tendencies but yet
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:16.380]   nevertheless he professes to be a Christian, and as far as you know, he was a Christian.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.460]   He had a good testimony for Christ, but he still had these weaknesses and tendencies
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.020]   in his life.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:45.220]   And then what's your question about him?
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.540]   He didn't want to be alone and single the rest of his life, and yet at the same time
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.580]   he couldn't embrace marrying a woman.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.660]   Alright, now we're assuming this guy is a genuine believer at this particular point.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.340]   If he is, then there's going to be a natural responsiveness in his heart to the Word of
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.340]   God.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:09.500]   Then a person like this has got to understand God's beautiful design in gender complementarianism.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.060]   And you've got to help him to see that as a counselor.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.780]   Because why is it that God created Adam uniquely male and Eve uniquely female?
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:24.580]   Because it says Adam was alone, alright?
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.580]   Genesis 2.18.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.900]   "It was not good for Adam to be alone.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.660]   I will make hell for suitable him."
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:40.940]   The only way that he was going to ultimately have satisfaction, not be alone, is to understand
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:48.740]   the beauty of the heterosexual relationship that God intended from the very beginning.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.580]   And you need to paint a beautiful picture of that, alright?
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.840]   In fact, you know, in counseling homosexuals, sometimes that's the most effective counsel.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.740]   It's not spending all your time describing all the different Bible passages that condemn
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.740]   homosexuality.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.340]   Usually, people like that understand that the Bible condemns it.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.380]   They're convicted in their own heart.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.840]   They have a conviction that's deep in their conscience.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.060]   But if you paint a beautiful picture of what God intended for the male-female relationship
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.100]   from the very beginning, they begin to see how their life and their desires are so out
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.940]   of whack with God's original plan.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.500]   And God's plan is beautiful.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.660]   That instills within them a real desire to get in line with God's plan, alright?
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:39.380]   Now, is it possible that he could get married to a wonderful Christian young lady and then
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.740]   later on still have those homosexual tendencies?
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.700]   Absolutely.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:51.260]   Those things can still come back on him, which only should serve to remind him of his own
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:57.780]   weakness in his flesh and the fact that he has to absolutely 100% rely upon the grace
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.860]   of God every single day in his life.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:09.180]   He needs to preach the gospel of grace to himself every single day.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:18.040]   And that's the only way that he's going to, in a sense, keep his hands clenched and tightly
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:25.620]   gripping the hands of Christ, totally trusting him.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.660]   That has to happen.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:38.140]   Alright, well, secondly, the characteristics of a good godly goal is to reflect biblical
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.660]   values and perspectives.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:49.940]   They have to reflect biblical values and perspectives.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.340]   Sometimes you'll get counselees come in to you and they'll say to you, "Pastor, all I
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.380]   want, I just want to feel good real fast."
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.980]   Alright, they're just really honest with you.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.820]   Well, you can help them do that.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.580]   You can tell them, "Just go out and buy several six-packs and find a couple of girls and go
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.900]   to a resort for a weekend.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.900]   You'll feel real good."
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.280]   Alright, but that's not going to be any more godly.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.100]   So they've got the wrong goals.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.040]   That's not the right kind of goal.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.020]   Their goal is not, "I want to feel good real fast."
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.980]   Their goal should be, "I want to understand how to be God's kind of man in the midst of
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.300]   this temptation."
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.920]   That should their goal be.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.980]   And then as they do that, eventually, as time goes along, they will feel better.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.900]   But their goal can't be just simply to feel better any more than their goal can be to
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.100]   just have victory over homosexuality.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.100]   No.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:51.900]   As they practice biblical things and those biblical thoughts and desires and attitudes
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.700]   become more and more prevalent in their life, then the temptation will weaken as time goes
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.140]   on.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:07.700]   But it still may be a temptation that God uses to keep them trusting in Him.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.980]   They understand their weakness.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.360]   So they must reflect biblical values and priorities.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.780]   Their goal for coming into counseling should be, "I want to be God's kind of woman.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.220]   I want to be God's kind of man.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   That's my goal.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   I want to glorify God.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.140]   I want to become more Christ-like," whatever that means.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.940]   So if they come in with the wrong agenda or the wrong goal, you're responsible for correcting
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.700]   that agenda or that goal.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.460]   Let me give you a good illustration of this.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:47.060]   Back several years ago, I had a young man who he and his wife had just started coming
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.020]   to our church.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.020]   They had a little baby.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:56.020]   The baby probably was about six months old.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.860]   He showed up in my office one day and said, "I need help."
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   I said, "Sure.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   Come on in.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.740]   Have a seat."
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.820]   We had prayer and I said, "What's the problem?
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.580]   What's going on?"
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.740]   And he said, "I need for you to help me get my wife back."
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.660]   I said, "Oh, really?
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.660]   What happened?"
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.500]   "Well, she left.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.660]   She took the baby, moved out.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.580]   I didn't even know it had happened.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   Took off somewhere.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:33.420]   I don't even know where she's at and I need you to help me get my wife back."
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.580]   And I knew at that particular point that that guy wanted genuine help that was certainly
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:43.180]   sincere in his heart, but I also knew something else really clearly, and that is that he came
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.740]   to me with all the wrong agenda.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.580]   And I said to him, "I don't think I can help you."
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.980]   And he was kind of surprised.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.460]   "I thought you guys did counseling at this church."
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.900]   I said, "We do.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.300]   But you told me you can't help me."
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   I said, "Right.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:07.060]   I don't know where your wife is and even if I did, I couldn't force her to come back.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:13.980]   So if your goal in coming to see me is to get your wife back, it's the wrong goal."
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.700]   That hit him like a ton of bricks.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:27.260]   "Well, then why should I come and see you?"
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.460]   "I'm glad you asked that question.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.920]   You should be coming in and sitting down and saying to me, 'Pastor, help me to be God's
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.860]   kind of man, God's kind of husband, God's kind of father, whether my wife comes back
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   or not.'"
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:52.300]   "Okay.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.900]   That's what I want to do," he said to me.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.900]   I said, "Good.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:56.900]   Now I can help you."
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.500]   All right.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.660]   So we dove right into it, that first counseling session.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.660]   About three weeks go by.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.500]   I've had three or four appointments with him by this time.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.700]   He shows up in counseling.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.980]   He says, "Guess what happened?"
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.340]   I said, "I have no clue."
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.740]   "My wife showed up at the apartment."
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.740]   "Really?"
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.740]   "With the baby."
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.220]   "Why'd she show up?"
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.340]   "Well, she came back to get some stuff that she had left behind.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   She needed it."
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.940]   "I haven't seen her for about three weeks."
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.580]   "Well, what happened?"
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.180]   "Well," he said, "I was actually sitting at the dining room table and I was doing my
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.300]   homework that you had given me to do and I had my Bible open, was studying some things.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.580]   And she walked in and she saw the apartment and everything was straight and everything
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.260]   was neat and everything was in order and I was cooking supper and it smelled really good
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:49.820]   in there and she looked around and she didn't say anything to me except, 'Wow, I should
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:58.780]   have left a long time ago.'"
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:05.060]   And he had, by this time, enough sense to be able to turn around and say to his wife,
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:11.020]   "I didn't do this to get you to come back.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:17.100]   I did this because I realized this is what I should have been doing all along.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:23.860]   I did this because that's what's honoring to God."
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.540]   And he told me her mouth dropped open.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:37.420]   You could tell what she was thinking, "Okay, who are you and what did you do with my husband?"
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:43.380]   She was so impressed by that, to make a long story short, she moved back in.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.240]   She started coming to church with her husband again.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.380]   Then she started coming to counseling sessions with her husband.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:55.580]   She ended up coming to Christ through the whole process.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:01.060]   But I'll tell you, I think I would have lost him and the opportunity to counsel both of
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.780]   them if I would have bought his agenda right at the beginning.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.740]   He came in and the first thing he says to me is, "I want you to help me to get my wife
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.400]   back."
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.860]   If I would have said, "Okay, sit down, let's talk about that," I would have lost that whole
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.500]   thing right there.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:25.580]   The very fact that I challenged his agenda and got him focused on being a godly man,
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:31.380]   a godly husband, and a godly father immediately turned the whole counseling case in the right
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   direction.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.380]   We set the goal.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:40.580]   It had to reflect the biblical value and perspective if it was going to do anything that was worthwhile.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:45.260]   It had to do that.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:45:00.860]   Thirdly, if this goal is going to be a good goal, then it has to be two-factored in nature.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:06.140]   Permanent change in the Christian life is always two-factored.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:15.020]   Ephesians 4, Colossians 3 talks about putting off, putting on the whole radical change process
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.380]   that needs to take place there.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.100]   You haven't really changed if you've stopped your sin.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:30.860]   But if you've stopped your sin and you have then replaced it with godly actions, attitudes,
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.460]   desires, then you've changed.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:41.380]   And that really is the process of metanoeo, that's the Greek term for repentance, to change
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.980]   one's mind from sin to righteousness.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:56.340]   There's the two-fold effect, from sin to righteousness.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   That's why we say that permanent change in the Christian life is always two-factored.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.920]   What does metanoeo mean?
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   It's a change of mind.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.500]   Meta is change.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.140]   Reduce is mind, so to change one's mind.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.900]   But within the context of the way in which the word is always used in the New Testament,
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.380]   it's a word that means a change of mind that is so complete that it leads to a change of
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.720]   life.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.260]   It's not just merely an intellectual change of mind.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:31.020]   It's a change of mind that is so complete that it leads to a change of life.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:36.940]   That's the kind of repentance we're talking about.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.660]   So this person has got to be willing to put off and put on.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.260]   This person has got to be willing to see the importance of repentance.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.740]   If there's going to be real change in their life, all of that has got to be true.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:54.880]   All right, let's pick up and talk about the characteristics of good goals.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.100]   We've talked about they have to be shared by the counseling and counselor.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.340]   They have to reflect biblical values and perspectives.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.460]   They have to be two-factored.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:07.260]   Not only must they put off the old way of life, they've got to also put on the new way
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.260]   of life.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.260]   Well, then number four, they also need to be realistic and specific.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:24.700]   Good goals need to be very realistic and they need to be specific.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.580]   For example, when you're talking to counselees, you don't want to say to a counselee, "Okay,
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.740]   now George, you need to go home and love your wife more."
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.060]   He doesn't know what that means.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:41.500]   George will have a tendency to think, "Okay, I need to go home and emote more good feelings
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   towards my wife."
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.020]   "All right, now I love you more."
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:52.580]   "No, you've got to be specific about this.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   George, I want you to go home this week and I want you to do some things that will communicate
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.460]   to your wife that you really love her.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.380]   What do you suppose those would be?"
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:06.420]   "Well," he says, "I guess I could fix some things around the house.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.100]   She's wanted me to do that for a long time."
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.460]   "Hey, that's good, George.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.060]   Let's fix some things around the house."
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.180]   "I guess I could wash dishes after supper at night."
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.460]   "Oh, yeah, that's good, George.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.460]   That's really helpful."
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.780]   "I think I could help her out with the kids and let her run off and go shopping a little
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   bit."
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.780]   "Yeah, that's good, George.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.780]   I like that."
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.700]   Now you're being very, very specific.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.520]   You're getting George to be specific.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:39.740]   The more concrete and specific you are, the more you're going to see change in your counselee.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.740]   The more concrete and specific you are, the more you're going to see change.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:55.380]   George, you need to stop interrupting your wife when she's talking and to look at her
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.540]   when she's speaking until she's finished.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:04.980]   So we're saying here that change really takes place in the specific and concrete, not in
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.560]   the abstract and vague.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:16.600]   You have got to get out of Vaguesville, and then you can get your counselees out of Vaguesville.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.200]   Or the other name for Vaguesville is Fuzzyland.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:26.120]   You've got to get out of Fuzzyland, and then you get your counselees out of Fuzzyland.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   Be concrete.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.480]   Be specific.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.560]   Let them know what you're talking about in terms of change.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   That's very realistic.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   They understand that.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.720]   "George, this coming week, I want you to wash the dishes for your wife three times."
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:48.700]   Okay, and then the next week, you increase it to four, and the next week, five times.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.000]   She's a very busy woman, George.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.480]   She's got a lot on her plate, and you can help her out.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.880]   All right, number five.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   These good goals also should reflect the particular deficiencies and needs of the persons that
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.520]   are involved.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:14.360]   For example, there are some people that just simply need to understand the gospel.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:22.200]   One of the worst things you can do is just assume that a person is a Christian.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.480]   They may think they're a Christian, but you begin to probe what they mean by that.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.280]   You find out that their trust is not in Christ alone.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.680]   They're trusting in some kind of behavior, some kind of penance that they do.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:42.560]   They're trusting in something else, their church attendance, or their tithing.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.280]   Something else that's not godly.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:56.000]   So you need to help them to see the resources that they have
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.240]   in Christ alone and to trust him alone.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:11.960]   Also, help your counselees use the resources that God provides, planning for some biblical
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.960]   self-talk.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.320]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.120]   You're not mentally ill if you talk to yourself.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.560]   You only become mentally ill if you answer yourself.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.080]   But you're not mentally ill if you talk to yourself.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:36.460]   And there's a lot of good biblical self-talk that you can use with people.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:44.040]   Help your counselees talk to themselves about what is right, what they need to think that's
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   right, what they need to desire that's right, what they need to do that's right.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.920]   "Oh, John, you did that very poorly.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.560]   You need to do this and then do it."
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.600]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.560]   Some biblical self-talk.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.120]   When you fail, you say, "Wow, that was stupid.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.240]   That was sinful.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.400]   That's a wrong thing for me to do."
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:24.240]   Get them to talk to themselves and use biblical self-talk.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:30.920]   Help your counselees recognize situations of temptation when there's wrong or unwise
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:37.140]   thinking and behaving.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.840]   What are the situations that are wrapped around it?
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:44.720]   And if you help them to identify that, oftentimes you can help them also to identify when they
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.600]   are actually leading up to a failure.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.960]   They can see the circumstances before it actually happens, are already set in motion for them
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.520]   to fail.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.400]   They can identify it and cut it short.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.240]   Help your counselee learn how to read and apply the Word of God on their own in a situation.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.600]   Don't always spoon-feed a counselee.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:16.680]   If you have a more mature counselee who's further along in their Christian walk, then
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.360]   take them to a passage of Scripture and begin to discuss it.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.040]   But don't feed them all the answers.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.280]   Give them questions.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.720]   Make them take a look at the Scripture and then look at their own life and help them
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:34.920]   to see how their life has to change in relationship with the Scripture.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:41.920]   There needs to be increasing of a counselee's awareness of biblical guidelines and priorities
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:49.000]   and principles like the nature of love, the importance of forgiveness, how to deal with
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.800]   a guilty conscience, and how to get a conscience cleansed.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.840]   Also have a counselee have a sense of what God wants each to change from and to.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.080]   Help them to understand that or help them to recognize and accept responsibility for
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:13.800]   his or her unbiblical thinking and behavior and get them to stop blame-shifting on their
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:20.760]   children or on their spouse or on their parents or whatever that they're responsible for their
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:26.700]   own attitudes and actions and even reactions to problems.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:32.400]   Help them to procure genuine forgiveness from each person that they have sinned against
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.920]   or offended.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   Help them secure commitment from each person making Christ and His purposes their standard
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.280]   for what they think and say and do.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.640]   Are you willing to be the wife, mother, woman that God wants you to be?
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.040]   Are you willing to be that way?
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:03.760]   Help each of them to commit to Christ-centered change regardless of the other person's behavior
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:09.840]   and help each of your counselees plan and implement personalized strategies.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.080]   For example, a wife may say to you, "You don't understand my husband.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.380]   When he gets home he's always irritated.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:19.680]   He brings all the frustrations of the office home with him."
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:25.040]   Well then you can help her plan for that particular time.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:31.280]   To allow her husband to in a sense have some unwind time, to let him decompress so to speak
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.360]   from all the pressures of the day before she hits him up with all the things that she wants
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:40.080]   him to do.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:47.360]   So no deep discussions or deep questioning of why he does this or that when he first
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.100]   comes home from work.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.900]   Give him a little bit of space.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:55.600]   Allow him to adjust to the home environment and get away from the pressures of what he's
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:00.400]   had to experience during that day in the office.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.720]   Help your counselee to practice new patterns long enough for them to become comfortable
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.760]   with them and don't let up too soon because it's easy to want to move on to the next agenda
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.000]   item and it gives you a false sense of progress.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   You don't want that.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.980]   You want the false sense of progress by moving from one agenda item to the other.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:26.800]   Make sure your counselee has really changed and the changes are complete there.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.040]   And then help family members support each other in their changing and encouraging one
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.880]   another.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.640]   If you're working with an entire family, that can be very, very critical.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.480]   Help them to be supportive with one another.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:51.960]   Now, so these good goals should reflect the particular deficiencies and needs of the person
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.960]   that's involved.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   What are they?
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:57:00.500]   Then in addition to this, these goals need to be focused upon heart change as well.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.440]   Heart change.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:10.040]   It's not enough for them to just merely change their behavior or their words or their technique
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.800]   of communication.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.240]   All of that is external changes.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:20.200]   But if their heart is not in it, it'll never be permanent change in that home.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.520]   They've got to take a look at their heart, the desires, intentions, expectations, motivations
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:31.880]   that tend to rule what they say, tend to dominate their attitudes and behaviors towards one
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.760]   another.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:40.740]   A wife who is bitter at her husband can change her communication technique towards him so
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.280]   that she doesn't sound as bitter anymore, but if her heart is still bitter, it's going
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.320]   to come out in some other way.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.280]   And eventually she'll go right back into the pattern of communicating in a bitter, resentful
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.800]   way towards him.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.460]   So her heart must change.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.160]   She's got to be able to see this.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.220]   What is it that she is idolizing in her heart that's more important than God?
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.520]   What has become her functional God in her heart?
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.480]   I want my husband to treat me well.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:16.200]   I want my husband to get out of the job that he's in and he's not getting out of that job.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:22.680]   I want him to get a better job where he can make more money for the family.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.800]   And so she's bitter and resentful over that fact.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:33.240]   I want him to do what I think should be done here.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.440]   Now she could change.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:39.240]   You can work on her communication skills with her husband so that she's not communicating
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.680]   bitterness.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.240]   But if her heart hasn't changed, she's still going to go along and be bitter and it's going
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.480]   to come out in other ways.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.080]   So her heart's got to change.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:59:02.680]   Furthermore, good goals should be properly motivated.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.040]   And they have to be related to the wide scope of biblical motives for change.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:13.480]   Without motives being touched in our goal statements in teaching, we could really become
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:20.800]   very moralistic in our counseling rather than biblical in our counseling.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:31.280]   Our purpose is to not set down a whole new law of right and wrongs that our New Testament
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   laws.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:41.720]   That's purpose, that's moralism, but it's certainly not biblical Christianity.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:48.560]   So we have to speak to motives, especially heart motives.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:57.400]   Now that's going to involve a theological motive, which is the primary overall motive.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.560]   Why should they be in counseling?
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:06.520]   Not to get their wife back, not to get their husband to treat them better, not to get the
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.120]   children to obey.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.560]   Why should they be in counseling?
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:16.520]   Ultimately so that they can be more Christ-like and they can bring more glory to God.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.520]   That's the ultimate theological motive.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520]   That rules everything.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.880]   I don't care what counseling circumstance it is, what marriage circumstance it is, it
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.900]   always has got to be that their theological motive is to please God and to be more Christ-like.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:38.220]   How can I be God's kind of man, God's kind of woman, God's kind of husband, God's kind
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.060]   of wife, God's kind of father, God's kind of mother, God's kind of child?
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.640]   How can I be that way?
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.720]   How can I set as my goal His glory no matter what happens in my family, no matter how my
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.600]   wife responds to me, or my husband responds to me, or my children respond to me, or my
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.440]   parents respond to me, or my siblings respond to me, how can I be a more godly person as
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.960]   a result of the circumstances that I'm going through?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:11.760]   That's the critical thing.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:21.800]   The second one is an interpersonal motive, and that is, if you will, this kind of just
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:31.280]   runs right down through Matthew 22, verses 37 through 39.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.200]   The Pharisees confront Jesus and say, "What is the greatest commandment?"
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.080]   And Jesus says to them, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.920]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.240]   Upon these two commands the whole law hangs."
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:55.120]   On those two pegs, loving God and loving others, everything else in life hangs.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.600]   Every counseling problem, every family problem, goes back to how much that person loves God
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:09.480]   and how much that person loves other people, especially in their family.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.040]   Loving your neighbor as yourself, and of course, the Bible is not saying there that we need
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.080]   to love ourselves more, and nowhere in the Bible does it ever say that.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.960]   We don't need to love ourselves more.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:25.340]   The Bible assumes all the time, and is literally replete with commands, that we love ourselves
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.000]   too much.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.440]   And in fact, that's the assumption that Jesus makes here.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.840]   We need to love God and love others with the same degree of passion that we already love
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.300]   ourselves.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:43.200]   We need to love God and love others with the same degree of passion that we already love
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.760]   ourselves.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.440]   Now that alone separates us from 95% of all the psychologies that are out there.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.080]   Furthermore, there needs to be an ethical motive.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:08.320]   Matthew chapter 6 and verse 33, "Seek first my kingdom and my righteousness, and all these
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.760]   other things will be added unto you.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:21.640]   Be ye holy even as I am holy."
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.560]   Be ye holy even as I am holy.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:33.440]   So the desire here is to be more holy, more righteous before God in our walk with him.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.520]   Fourth, there has to be ultimately an existential motive.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.300]   That is, we want to promote biblical relationships.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:55.120]   We want to resolve specific problems in life, in their life.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.340]   But our goal is not primarily to get rid of their problems.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:00.680]   That's not our goal.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.360]   Our goal primarily is to teach them to be God's kind of people in the midst of their
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.540]   problems.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.540]   That's our goal.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.220]   That's our purpose.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.780]   You may or may not be able to get rid of their problems.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:18.180]   I was pretty successful to get rid of my counselee's problems, and then they came back to me later
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.780]   and God had thrown problems 10 times worse into their lives.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   Ah!
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:31.020]   So I began to realize, listen, I may actually, trying to get them out of their problems,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.100]   may be working against God here.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.580]   Those problems are there for a purpose.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.740]   So that's not my goal.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:43.060]   My goal is to help them to be a godly man or woman in the midst of those problems.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:51.620]   Now that I can help them do.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:05:07.140]   But we don't take our eye off the fact that we want to help them be, solve problems.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.820]   I mean we can't forget John 8, 32 where it talks about the truth will set you free.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:18.760]   In Philippians 4, 7, the peace of God will guard your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.260]   So God wants us to be at peace.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.940]   He wants truth to set us free.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.940]   He's not opposed to problems like that or being set free from problems.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:39.700]   It just may not be his immediate will for that to happen.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.220]   So these good goals have to be properly motivated.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.220]   Those are all the characteristics.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.760]   There are at least seven of them that are characteristics of good goals for marriage
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.880]   and family counseling.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.940]   Now if we can, we want to summarize these.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.720]   There's a summary here of the basic and/or general aims or goals of marriage and family
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.020]   counseling.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:12.940]   The first summary is we want to make sure these goals for marriage and family counseling
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:21.580]   will secure heart commitment from all family members to Christ and to his word as the standard
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.260]   for all that is said and done.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:27.740]   That's what we want to do.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.860]   We want to secure that kind of commitment for all that is said and done.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.420]   Now what is that going to result in?
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:42.480]   All of that will manifest itself in a desire and a willingness to put off all that is
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:47.980]   unbiblical and thus dishonoring to God and destructive to the marriage and family relationships.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.100]   That goal will do that.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:56.140]   It will manifest itself in a desire and a willingness to put off all that is unbiblical
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:02.260]   and dishonoring to God and that which is destructive to the marriage and family relationship.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:08.800]   Secondly, it will also produce a desire and a willingness to put on all that is biblical
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.480]   and thus pleasing to God and good for marriage and family relationships.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.940]   That's where we say there's that "put off, put on" thing.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.700]   Permanent change in Christian life is always two-factored.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.980]   You've got to get rid of the old and replace it with the new.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:30.100]   Furthermore, we have to foster and establish true companionship, the essence of marriage
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.020]   between family members.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.660]   What is a true companionship there?
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.580]   These goals will also facilitate, on every level, the resolution of the problem that
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.060]   initially brought them for counseling.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:49.940]   Furthermore, these goals will lead to deep unity and intimacy within the family.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.800]   They will also cause their marriage to be a powerful witness for Christ and a tremendous
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:00.300]   example for others as they exemplify in their family the relationship between Christ and
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.500]   His Church.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.980]   And they ultimately will help them to fulfill the purpose for which they and their families
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:13.940]   exist, namely, to bring honor and glory to God.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:21.960]   If we were to summarize all those things that these goals are supposed to do, that's what
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:34.340]   it should do if you have a family that's willing and is ready to do things God's way.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.260]   Now how do we do this?
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.380]   This is the how-to part.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:45.100]   How do you identify, determine, and prioritize the what, when, and how of goals that should
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.900]   be pursued in counseling sessions?
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:56.540]   All right, number one, I think the first thing that we have to do, and we're doing much more
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.020]   here than just merely giving lip service to this.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   This is imperative.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.260]   Prayer is really key here.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:12.220]   James 1, 5, "If anyone lacks wisdom, he needs to ask of God who gives liberally."
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:21.100]   So, prayer is key here.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:25.780]   When you set goals for marriage and family counseling, you need to pray over those goals
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:28.980]   and make sure that you're doing them as biblically as possible.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   This is not based upon what you would like to see.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:37.620]   This is what God says should be done.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:44.580]   Secondly, listen for the express goals of your counselees.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:49.020]   What are the express goals?
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:54.220]   Proverbs chapter 21 and verse 22 says, "The wise man attacks the city of the mighty and
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:10:02.260]   pulls down the stronghold in which they trust."
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.340]   What are their express goals?
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:13.780]   Proverbs 25, 20, "Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day or like a vinegar
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:20.740]   poured on a soda is one who sings songs to a heavy heart."
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.660]   So we've got to be wise.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:29.780]   You've got to start, in essence, where your counselee is, not where you would like him
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   or her to be.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.740]   You've got to start where they are.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.420]   Is the counselee focusing on what they can control or what they cannot control?
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.020]   Are they focusing on their feelings?
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:45.020]   Are they focusing on righteous behavior?
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:50.300]   In other words, a counselee should be coming to you and saying, "I need to know how to
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:59.780]   handle my husband's anger."
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.180]   What they're really asking is, "How am I going to respond when my husband gets angry?"
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.180]   That's what they should be asking.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.660]   But more often than not, what you get is something like this, "I want my husband to stop being
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:15.940]   angry with me and I need for you to help me to stop that."
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.900]   You may not be able to do that.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.220]   The husband may not be a believer, and if he is a believer, he may not be willing to
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:31.260]   come into counseling.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.820]   Or you could say, a mother says, "I want my child to open up to me.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.620]   Help me to get my child to open up."
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:46.900]   Well, I can't do that, but I can teach you how to be a godly mother when your child doesn't
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.420]   open up.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.780]   I can help you to understand that.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:12:01.300]   "I want you to help me to get my daughter to trust my judgment," a mother says.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:12.020]   Well, I can't do that, but I can sure help you in front of your child be a better, more
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:18.660]   godly mother so it will be easier for your child to trust you.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.060]   That doesn't mean your child is going to trust you.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.520]   I can do that.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.340]   Or somebody says to you, "I want to feel more worthwhile in life."
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:37.580]   Well, even though all of us to some degree or another would like to feel that way, you
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.100]   may or may not be able to conjure that up in that counselee's life, but you can sure
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.260]   show them how to be a godly person in life.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.760]   And when they're a godly person, then I believe the right feelings of being worthwhile and
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.900]   significant to other people will come.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:06.820]   So you begin to see here, you've got to listen for your counselee's express goals.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:07.820]   What are they?
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:16.620]   What is it that they really want?
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:24.180]   Like the young lady who came in, she's 19 years old and she says to me, "Dr. Street,
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.700]   I really need your help."
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.380]   I said, "How do you want me to help you?"
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.540]   "I need you to help me to get my parents off my back."
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   Well, I have no control over her parents.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:46.500]   I don't know what her parents are going to do, but as I can say to her with all confidence,
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   "I can't do that.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:52.580]   I can't get your parents off your back, but I can sure teach you how to respond in a godly
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.180]   fashion when your parents are on your back.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.180]   I can help you with that."
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:07.340]   Oh, what are your counselee's expressed goals?
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.220]   And then, obviously, this brings us to the second one, and that is what are your counselee's
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:14.980]   unexpressed goals and intentions?
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.740]   What are their unexpressed goals?
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:26.820]   For example, you have passages like Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 15.
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.540]   In fact, grab your Bible just for a moment.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.780]   That's a good passage to go back to.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:43.140]   Proverbs 18, 15, "The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:50.700]   seek knowledge."
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:15:04.060]   So a person who's going to be a good counselor has got to ask yourself, "What are my counselee's
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:14.780]   goals that they're not expressing?"
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:28.380]   For example, you get a man who comes in to counseling with his wife, and he acknowledges
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:34.220]   in the counseling session that he's having an affair, and he's unwilling to abandon the
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.740]   affair.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:46.560]   And so your natural conclusion is, "Why in the world does this person come for counseling?"
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:55.160]   If he came in unwilling to abandon his affair, why has he come to counseling?
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.140]   His goal certainly isn't to be God's kind of man.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.980]   If that were true, he'd abandon his affair.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.300]   Why does he come to counseling?
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.220]   Well, more often than not, a person like that will come to counseling, they'll use some
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:13.820]   kind of excuse, and they'll say, "Well, I knew that my wife was going to need some help
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.220]   when she found out that this affair was going on, so I came in for her sake," as if he really
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.220]   loves her.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.220]   "Hello?"
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:24.100]   I don't buy that a minute.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.220]   There's usually something else behind that.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.960]   That's his express purpose for coming in.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.600]   "I'm coming in to help my wife because this is going to be hard on her."
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.520]   Yeah, I believe that.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.720]   What is it?
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.600]   Well, most guys will come into counseling because they want to look good in the eyes
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.680]   of their family.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   That's why.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.280]   They want to look good.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.020]   They want to be able to go home to mom and dad and say, "You know what?
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020]   I tried.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.760]   I went to counseling with her, and it didn't work."
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.480]   You know why it didn't work?
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.760]   Because long before he ever came to counseling, he determined in his mind, "I don't care what
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.760]   they say.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]   I'm not going to follow this.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.800]   I'm having too much fun having this affair."
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.940]   They've already determined that.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.040]   That's the unexpressed goal.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   So they want to look good.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.800]   They want to be able to say to their relatives long after the divorce, "You know, I tried.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   I did.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   I tried to make it work.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.420]   I went to counseling with her."
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:27.540]   Boy, how deceptive the wicked human heart is, isn't it?
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.480]   How clever it is.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.700]   By the way, I didn't know that as a young pastor.
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:39.700]   I got fooled a couple of times on that one, but I began to pick up on this.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:44.380]   I'm a slow learner, but eventually I began to see what was going on here.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.500]   I know why you're coming to counseling.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.200]   I get the full picture.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.660]   You want to be able to go home to mom and dad later on and say, "You know, I really
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.940]   tried to make this work, but this was all her fault."
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:03.660]   So I don't let them get away with that at all.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.660]   What do you do?
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.660]   You say, "I think that your real reason for coming to counseling is because you want to
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:12.500]   look good in the eyes of your parents.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.060]   You already have an agenda.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.180]   You're already mentally out of this marriage.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:21.340]   You're just going through, jumping through the hoops right now in the processes in order
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.140]   to make it look good to everybody.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.740]   Well, you know what?
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.940]   I'm not going to play those games.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.420]   I'm not going to play those games.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.860]   Either you come to the realization that this is a wicked sin before God and you repent
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.580]   now, or I'm not interested in seeing you for counseling.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:42.860]   I'll work with your wife, but I'm not going to work with you.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.500]   You've got to come to that point."
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:53.100]   So or there's Proverbs chapter 27.
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:19:00.620]   As a counselor, you need to remember this in verse 19, "As in water, face reflects face,
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.380]   so the heart of a man reflects a man."
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:07.940]   What's going on in the heart of your counselee?
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.220]   What's going on in the heart?
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:17.620]   We could also go back to Proverbs chapter 16 in verse 2, twice in Proverbs, this is
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:23.940]   said by the way, "All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, but the Lord weighs
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.420]   the motives."
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:32.040]   If you go over to Proverbs 21 in verse 2, very similar statement there, "Every man's
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.220]   way is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the motives."
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.820]   Both of those particular passages, by the way, reflect the fact that man already has
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:44.980]   a very self-favoring view of himself.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:50.220]   And that's the reason why he's so quick at self-justification.
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.740]   Because of that self-favoring view, he's very quick to justify himself.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.860]   You're not in counseling very long before you pick that one up because sometimes when
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:06.780]   you're talking to a person about what's happened in their past, they wax eloquent about how
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:12.060]   other people have misused them, abused them, mistreated them.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:19.820]   They'll paint it for you in living color, a huge picture of how other people have mistreated
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.280]   them and wronged them.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.820]   And then when you ask them in the counseling session, "What is it that maybe you have done
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:30.140]   wrong or said wrong as part of your past?"
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:40.580]   They'll all of a sudden get this glazed look in their eyes, "Well, I know I didn't always
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.940]   do right, but let me tell you what that other person did."
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.740]   And then they circle right back around.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   Now why do they do that?
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:52.900]   Well, because that's what Proverbs 16, 2 and Proverbs 21, 2 says they will do.
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:58.020]   They already have a very self-favoring view of themselves, but the Lord ultimately is
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:03.860]   the one who weighs the motives behind it.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.900]   Or here's another good passage.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:15.220]   Let's go over to 1 Corinthians 4 and verse 4, 1 Corinthians 4, 4.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:24.720]   Paul here says, "For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted,
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.500]   but the one who examines me is the Lord."
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.620]   So he says, "I can examine my own conscience.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:35.580]   My conscience can be clear, but ultimately that's not the thing that really lets me off
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.400]   the hook.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.560]   It's only when the Lord does it."
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.560]   And you know what?
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.860]   You're going to get counselees that will say that to you.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:44.860]   You know that, don't you?
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:49.140]   They'll come in and say to you, "My conscience is clear."
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.180]   And I say to them, "That's too bad."
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.220]   "What do you mean it's too bad?"
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.340]   Because that means nothing.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.140]   That doesn't mean you're guiltless.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:07.480]   That just means that you have a poorly trained conscience.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.860]   The point is, does God clear your conscience?
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.980]   Would God look at your conscience and say, "It's clear"?
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.660]   That's what Paul says.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.380]   He says, "In his own conscience, I'm conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.380]   this acquitted."
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:29.580]   I'm not acquitted because of this, but the one who examines me is the Lord.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:36.380]   He's the one who acquits me, then I'm really not guilty.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:39.620]   So you've got to listen for the unexpressed goals and intentions of your counselee because
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.900]   there are an awful lot of counselees who will make this statement.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.540]   "I have a clear conscience in the way that I've treated my wife."
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:53.660]   "I have a clear conscience in the way I've treated my husband," they'll say.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.380]   Well, you know what?
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.740]   That's not the standard for whether or not your conscience should be clear or not.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:02.460]   The standard is whether or not the Lord acquits you.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.000]   That's the standard.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.960]   It's not whether or not your conscience is clear.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:17.260]   So listen to the unexpressed goals.
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:22.540]   Back several years ago, there was a 20-year-old single mom that moved in with her single divorce
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:33.340]   older mother, and she complained after living with her for a while, this younger mother.
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:37.300]   She says, "My mother treats me like her little child.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:44.220]   She has ideas about my little Joanna, my two-year-old, about when I should be in the house, et cetera,
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.060]   as though I was still some kind of a teenager."
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:55.740]   Now, when you listen to her explanation of what went on, it sounds like all of her problems
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.140]   stems from whom?
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.140]   Her mom.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.580]   All of her problems stem from her mom.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:09.140]   "If you can just help me to get my mother off my back, I'll be okay."
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.660]   She wants the conflict to disappear.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:12.180]   She wants a good relationship with her mother.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:19.500]   She wants to not feel the rejection from her abandoning father and now her husband that
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.380]   abandoned her.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:27.140]   Each one of those goals goes just a little bit deeper into the water than the first expressed
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.140]   exasperation.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.580]   She had been abandoned as a little girl by her father.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:43.960]   Now she had been abandoned by her husband.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:50.940]   These were part of the deep hurts and problems of the past that were flavoring her relationship
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:25:00.460]   with her mother and that she felt that her mother wasn't treating her well.
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:06.540]   Now, when counselees come like this, their intentions may seem quite acceptable and even
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.820]   godly to them.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:15.380]   They may not be intentionally deceitful or blaming, and yet in the final analysis, they're
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.620]   really handling their situation in a sinful or wrong way.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.540]   That's where that Proverbs 16.2 says, "All a man's ways seem innocent in his own sight,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:32.460]   but the Lord weighs the motives."
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.620]   There's another woman who came in for counseling where she said, "I need to know how to handle
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:42.180]   my husband's insensitivity and incommunicableness."
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.460]   And so I asked if her husband would start joining us for counseling, and he started
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.880]   coming into counseling.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:55.340]   And I began to immediately see in the counseling situation that her reactions to her husband's
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:01.020]   decisions of thinking were totally shutting him down.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:07.660]   Any time her husband would say something that she didn't like, which was frequent, she would
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:16.160]   look over to him and say, "Well, that's kind of dumb," "Well, that's stupid," "We really
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.640]   don't think that," she'd say.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.020]   So she was constantly demeaning him.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:30.500]   Now she comes to me with the presentation problem that her husband isn't communicating
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.500]   with her.
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:40.680]   But the real issue was, every time he attempted to communicate something, he was challenged.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.340]   Why do we want to do that?
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:48.380]   We shouldn't want to do it that way.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:52.260]   And when he would ask her opinion, she'd say, "It's no use talking to you, you've already
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   made up your mind."
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:27:02.440]   Now you'll hear people do that, they'll do that right in front of you.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.580]   Now what was the problem?
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:10.360]   The problem was that her husband did want to communicate with her, but every time he
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:17.780]   attempted to communicate, she was chopping him off at the knees.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:24.860]   What you say is stupid, you're a dummy, you can't think, you have nothing worthwhile to
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.980]   communicate and if you want to communicate something, then you've really already made
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:36.940]   up your mind so it's worthless for me to say anything.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.420]   Unexpressed goals.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:44.960]   Listen to those unexpressed goals.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.900]   Listen past the most obvious problems, sins, and complaints.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.300]   Listen past them.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:57.580]   Proverbs 18, verse 2, "A fool finds no pleasure in understanding, but delights in airing his
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.580]   own opinions."
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:06.180]   Proverbs 25, verses 7 and 8, "What you have seen with your own eyes, do not bring hastily
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:14.340]   to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?"
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:21.340]   Proverbs 18, verse 13 talks about, "He who is first to present his case seems just until
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:27.060]   another comes along and questions him."
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.700]   So you've got to listen past the most obvious problems, sins, and complaints.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.900]   What's really going on here?
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:40.980]   Now this is something that I had to train myself to do because maybe as a man I'm not
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.420]   trained to do this.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.740]   My wife is much better than this.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:47.980]   She's really good at reading between the lines.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.540]   I just take what people say at face value.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:54.860]   They say this to me, "Okay, that's good, that works."
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.500]   But my wife's reading between the lines.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.940]   You know what they really meant by that?
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:05.180]   No, what?
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.060]   So I have to train myself to think about this.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.700]   I guess I'm just way too gullible.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:13.220]   I want to take what people say straight up.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:17.860]   Some people talk like that, but not everybody.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:24.800]   There's a counseling case several years ago where husband and wife were seen together
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.500]   but they had been separated for about a month.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:32.000]   He was unfaithful and left her, deciding he didn't want to be married anymore.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.220]   He had had several affairs in their brief four year marriage and the joy obviously had
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.420]   gone out of their marriage.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:43.500]   They can't talk without getting into an argument.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:49.140]   Now he has come in sorrow saying that he believes divorce is wrong and he wants to make it work,
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.420]   but she isn't sure that she can trust him.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.260]   So what are you going to do with this?
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:00.220]   He wants to reconcile the relationship.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.220]   He was wrong.
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:03.320]   He says he repents.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.820]   He's violated the marriage on a repeated basis.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:15.300]   So the question as a counselor is, is your primary goal in your counseling to get them
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:20.900]   to live together as quickly as possible?
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:26.660]   Should you as a counselor to work first to unite them?
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:30.580]   What's the question?
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:35.420]   What's really going on here?
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:39.980]   I want to suggest to you that that's not your primary goal.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.740]   Why?
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:52.500]   When you have a man who has repeatedly committed adultery, you probably have a what?
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.260]   An unbeliever.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:59.900]   Your goal here then is what?
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.900]   The gospel.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:06.760]   Your goal is the gospel.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.180]   Your goal is not to primarily get them back together again as quickly as I can.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.860]   I've got to get them back together again.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.660]   No.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:20.220]   Now that they're separated, that could be one of the worst things because she cannot
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.980]   remarry a man who is an unbeliever.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.300]   She can't do that.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:38.620]   So you can't get them together again, get them remarried and living together again because
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.880]   she would be in sin.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.620]   But yet his express goal is what?
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:50.500]   The former husband's express goal is, "I want to get married."
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:59.340]   Well, you have to, in a sense, listen past the most obvious things, problems and sins
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:04.460]   and complaints, and get at the core things.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.020]   What's really important here?
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.580]   What do we want to prioritize?
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:12.860]   Okay.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:20.420]   Now there's just a couple more that we're going to do here and then we will take a break.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:24.820]   Number five, take the expressed and unexpressed goals of the counselees and reframe them in
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:30.140]   Biblical terms and along the lines of God's priorities.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:33.660]   We can see this in John chapter 8 verses 3 through 11.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:39.020]   That's the woman who's caught in adultery and Jesus says, "Where are your accusers?
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.380]   Neither do I condemn you.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:44.620]   Go and sin no more."
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:49.100]   Does the Lord show at this particular point sensitivity to her guilt, to her culpability?
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:55.580]   Her goal in all this was to avoid the temporal punishment of being stoned and minimize the
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:00.460]   shame through the secrecy and probably through escape, but she got caught.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.460]   But what does Jesus do?
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:08.140]   He reframes the whole thing to direct her to avoid eternal punishment, not temporal
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.460]   punishment.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.940]   Avoid eternal punishment and shame along with the temporal consequences.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.940]   How do you do that?
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:19.940]   Well, the answer was through repentance.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:26.360]   Proverbs 25, 20, "Like one who takes a coat on a cold day, sings songs to a heavy heart."
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:34.380]   So we need to show how righteousness addresses the real needs and is determined by God's
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.580]   purposes versus their felt needs.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:39.420]   How does righteousness do that?
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:46.300]   Proverbs 25, 20, Jeremiah 6, 14, it says, "The priests of ancient Israel would dress
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:50.740]   the wounds of my people as though they were not serious," God says.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.900]   We don't want to be like those priests.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.660]   We don't want to dress the wounds as if they're not serious.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:34:01.980]   Be sure to affirm God's motives for change, not pragmatic feelings, likely outcomes as
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:06.620]   though a technique were a manipulative strategy for helping people to get what they want from
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:07.620]   God.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.980]   No, that's not our goal.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:12.860]   6.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:18.100]   Then explain the process dynamics of biblical counseling for marriage and the family.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:23.140]   Sometimes this involves talking about an interpretive hermeneutical bridge or what we sometimes
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:26.540]   refer to as the eight eyes in counseling.
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:32.260]   In our next session, we're going to talk about those at the beginning of it.
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:33.820]   What are those eight eyes?
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:37.440]   They're just a way to think about the entire counseling process.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:44.300]   They involve involvement, inspiration, inventory, interpretation, instruction, inducement, implementation,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:45.580]   integration.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   Those are the eight eyes.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.980]   Now, I'll explain those later on.
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:55.380]   And then as a way to sort of remember them, this is a little acrostic, put CAPT and the
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.260]   eight eyes into practice.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.260]   What are we talking about?
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.340]   Well, C has to do with context.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:05.300]   What is the context of your marital and family counseling?
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.300]   What is it?
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:13.180]   Assessment and analyze is A. Promote and permanentize is P. And T is where do I find
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:18.220]   the final or at what particular point do I finally terminate the counseling?
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.300]   That's T. That's what we're talking about there.
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.300]   All right.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:21.300]   Thank you.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.300]   [end]
