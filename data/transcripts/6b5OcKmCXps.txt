[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.600]   try to understand why the translation was made the way it was.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.640]   Sometimes it's very helpful to understand
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.160]   and explain why the translation
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.560]   uses this word rather than a different synonym or something like that.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.600]   It lets you get a little bit of a
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960]   peek into the mind of the translator.
