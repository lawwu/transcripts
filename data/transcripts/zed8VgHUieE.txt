[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940]   - Believe it or not, in seminary,
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.900]   John Piper got a C- in one of his preaching classes.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.020]   Yes, a C-.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.780]   It's hard to believe, but it's true.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.340]   And he talked about it a few years back
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.580]   when he was asked where and how did he learn to preach.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.580]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.860]   - Watching my dad when I was six, eight, 10, 12.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.880]   Watching how not to do it in lots of places.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   Being unable to speak from grade five
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.680]   to my sophomore year in college,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.640]   unable to speak in front of a group.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.080]   I think I was learning to preach during that time.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.640]   Because I was so hurt, so wounded, so discouraged,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.040]   so desperate that I had to go way down into God
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.880]   and way into scripture and way into pain.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.600]   And God was making a preacher.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.800]   I was shot in my mouth.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.440]   You don't become an effective preacher
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.920]   by becoming loquacious and effective communicator at age 16.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.520]   You become a communicator, clever communicator,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.480]   but you don't become a preacher of the holy things of God.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.200]   So that was a piece.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040]   I don't know.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   The courses that I took on preaching were marginally,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.880]   I got the lowest grade in seminary in my preaching class.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.560]   I got a C minus, I think,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.120]   in James Dane's preaching class at Fuller Seminary.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.520]   We never agreed on anything.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.880]   Except the principle that every text should have,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.920]   every sermon should have one point.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560]   He said that over and over again.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.780]   So I made a terrible grade there.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.960]   But there were other teachers that...
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.040]   I think the way I became a preacher
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.800]   was by being passionately thrilled
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100]   by what I was seeing in the Bible in seminary.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.520]   Passionately thrilled.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.720]   When Philippians began to open to me,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.440]   Galatians opened to me, Romans opened to me,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.720]   the Sermon on the Mount opened me in classes on exegesis,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.060]   not homiletics, but exegesis,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.240]   everything in me was feeling,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.880]   I wanna say this to somebody.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.200]   I wanna find a way to say this 'cause this is awesome.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.820]   This is incredible.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.820]   So preachers today that go everywhere but the Bible
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.120]   to find something interesting
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480]   or something scintillating and passionate,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   I don't get it.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.760]   I don't get that at all.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480]   Because I have to work hard to leave the Bible
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.940]   and go somewhere to find an illustration
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.360]   because everything here is just blowing me away.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.920]   And it's that sense of being blown away by what's here,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.240]   by the God that's here and the Christ that's here
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.640]   and the gospel that's here
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.360]   and the spirit that's here and the life that's here
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   being blown away by this,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.920]   just kind of say, that's gotta get out.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.400]   That's gotta get out.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.920]   And then I suppose how it gets out,
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740]   what is that?
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.200]   How it gets out, I don't know what that is.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.600]   That's just the way I'm wired
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.080]   that I would say it a certain way
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   and then it's owing to me being a lit major.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.260]   That affects your language a little bit.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.240]   And goodness, a thousand things go into your life
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.560]   and nobody can copy anybody else.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   And I don't know.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.680]   God makes us who we are.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.020]   I don't think there's much you can do to become a preacher
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.040]   except know your Bible
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.860]   and be unbelievably excited about what's there
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.360]   and love people a lot.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.920]   And just wanna make the connection with people
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.760]   in what's there.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.080]   - That was Pastor John Piper,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.120]   who is home from his trip to the Middle East.
