[00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000]   Chris, how are you doing?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Good to meet you.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   So, as Max mentioned, we have glasses here.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   We start with a foundation of great glasses, something stylish, lightweight, wearable.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.100]   I'm going to say how can we build great technology and experiences on top of that.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.900]   One of the core tenets of the Android XR platform, this idea of a multimodal conversational device,
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900]   see what you see, hear what you hear.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.900]   So, you've got a camera, you've got speakers, multiple microphones for speaker isolation.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900]   I'll give you a chance to try these yourself.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.400]   Yeah, sorry, I woke it up there.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   Whoa.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   So, the first thing you see, simple, straightforward home screen.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   Yes.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.700]   So, you probably see the time, the weather, calendar appointments there.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.700]   This is designed to be sort of your one-stop shop for quick glanceable information throughout
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.700]   the day.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.000]   We want to do something that's easy to get what you need and then go back to what you're
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   doing.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900]   So, you can imagine turning on the display, getting that quick glance and then continuing
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900]   on your way.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900]   You can be fully conversational at this point.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.600]   You can ask questions, for example, about the paintings.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600]   You can interrupt.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   You can ask follow-up questions.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800]   As I mentioned before, if you want to at any time pause, you just tap there on the right.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000]   Gemini, how much does this painting cost?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.100]   The painting is called The Bridge of Leifelib, 1875, by Armand Guillaumet.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   It appears to be a print and it would be impossible to know its cost without finding the seller.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.000]   Okay, so this is fake.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.300]   I understand.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.200]   Why do humans pay so much money for paintings?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   People pay a lot for paintings because of their artistic merit.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.300]   The artist's paying is a decent rarity and for the appreciation you learn.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.800]   Did you catch Google I/O last week by any chance?
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.300]   Yes.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.200]   So, you might have seen on stage the Google Maps experience very briefly.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.400]   I wanted to give you a chance to get a sense of what that feels like today.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.300]   You can imagine you're walking down the street.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.500]   If you look up, like you're walking straight ahead, you get quick turn-by-turn directions.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.200]   So, you have a sense of what the next turn is like.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.700]   Nice.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.900]   Keeping your phone in your pocket.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.300]   Oh, that's so intuitive.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   Sometimes you need that quick sense of which way is the right way.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.300]   Sometimes.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.000]   So, let's say you're coming out of subway, getting out of a cab.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500]   You can just glance down at your feet.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.300]   We have it set up to translate from Russian to English.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.300]   I think I get to wear the glasses and you can speak to me if you don't mind.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.700]   I can speak Russian.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.300]   Привет, друг.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.000]   Как у тебя дела?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.600]   I'm doing well.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.500]   How are you doing?
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Tempted to swear, tempted to say inappropriate things.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.300]   А ты сразу мой голос слышишь или подождать надо?
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   I see it transcribed in real time, and so, obviously, you know, based on the different
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.100]   languages and sequence of subjects and verbs, there's a slight delay sometimes, but it's
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   really just like subtitles for the real world.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   Cool.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   Thank you for this.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.100]   Thank you for watching this clip.
