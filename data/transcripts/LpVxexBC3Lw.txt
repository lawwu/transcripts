[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   But what I'm trying to teach or model for my kids, because the modeling is the real
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400]   thing, right?
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.320]   With kids, what you do is really what matters.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760]   So what I'm trying to model for them is some happy medium, right?
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.200]   Like A, recognizing that we're fortunate to just be okay and not have to worry about buying
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   food and paying the rent.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   Like, that's a big one, right?
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.760]   Like don't take that for granted.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   We're lucky.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.640]   Two, like it's okay to buy yourself something nice, but remember, like if you buy this thing,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   you're going to have less money and less ability to buy something else in the future.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.760]   So is it worth it to you, right?
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.360]   It's that idea, that idea of value.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   That's really what I want to teach my kids.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.320]   my kids.
