[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   I would really like to talk about reward circuitry just thematically.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.580]   Listeners of this podcast, and even if they've never heard one of these podcasts before,
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.180]   probably familiar with the word dopamine.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.140]   We've talked about it a bit.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.220]   And as we were talking about earlier, everything about the dopamine reward circuitry, which
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.340]   of course includes other chemicals too, is based on prior experience relative to current
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.140]   experience relative to anticipated outcome.
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.380]   What's sometimes referred to as reward prediction error.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.660]   Think something great is going to happen, something great happens, great.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500]   Think something great is going to happen, something less than great happens, sucks way
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.660]   more than you would anticipate.
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.260]   Think that something not so great is going to happen, something so-so or great happens,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.940]   huge reward.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.060]   Novelty surprise brings the...
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.600]   Relative novelty and surprise brings the biggest rewards.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.180]   I would like to kind of paint as the backdrop, think about it as a conceptual mural behind
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.180]   us.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.800]   As I asked the question, maybe, just maybe, we're not supposed to be happy all the time
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.980]   or maybe even all that often.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.660]   And when we're feeling not so great or even lousy, provided it's not dangerous levels
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.340]   of depression, maybe we should frame that as the backdrop for the greater happiness
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340]   that will come when we start to emerge from that lousy state.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.300]   Now, some people would say, "Well, now you're just kind of using neurobiology to twist around
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.100]   what would otherwise be a lousy experience and tell me that it's good for me."
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.660]   No, what I'm trying to say is people want to be happy, I think we'd all love to be happy
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.580]   all the time, but we're not wired to be happy all the time.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.740]   And maybe the feelings of happiness can't exist unless they have contrast with these
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.180]   neutral or negative emotion states that we call, I don't know, feeling lousy, feeling
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.380]   anxious, et cetera.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.340]   And just, I realize I can pose long questions, but I just want to provide a little bit more
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.100]   context for the moment, which is that every circuit in the brain, our ability to see light,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.320]   literally, depends on the contrast with the so-called off-circuitry, which is the circuitry
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.900]   in our visual system that perceives darkness.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.660]   We need contrast to be able to see light.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.920]   Everything's push-pull, hunger, satiety, cold, heat, perception, go, no-go, it's all push-pull
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.240]   circuitry in there.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.740]   Why wouldn't happiness have a push-pull relationship with unhappiness or at least neutral affect?
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.740]   Well, I think it does.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.280]   I mean, you're giving a neurobiological explanation for what psychologists in this field of positive
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.980]   psychology have referred to as what's called hedonic adaptation, which is a fancy way of
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.460]   saying we get used to stuff.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.940]   You know, you, like, grab the, you know, delicious ice cream cone or I don't know, or Cuban,
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.940]   we do a delicious salad, really healthy, but it's a tasty, healthy, tasty salad, right?
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.980]   Start eating it.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.540]   First bite is like, this is awesome.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   I'm so into it.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.540]   It's great.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.860]   Bite number two, a little bit less awesome, a little bit less.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.060]   By the 10th bite, it's not because you're full or you're, like, you know, feeling disgusted.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.640]   It's just like that sensory experience, you've gotten used to it, right?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.320]   It's just no longer as interesting.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   Walk into a bakery.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.760]   Mmm, it smells amazing.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.400]   Spend five minutes in the bakery, 10 minutes in the bakery, you attenuate, you habituate.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.880]   I mean, you wouldn't maybe want to be firing your neurons when you get all exhausted and
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   stuff, but it's in one way terrible for happiness, another way very good for happiness, but in
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.600]   a major way terrible for happiness, which is the following.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.720]   Every good thing in life, if it sticks around, becomes kind of boring over time.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.880]   You're just kind of used to it.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.820]   I use the example sometimes of, you know, the last time, the first time your partner
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.620]   said I love you or if you had a kid, the first time your kid said mommy or daddy, that feels
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.300]   amazing, right?
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.580]   But like, you know, last week my husband said I love you, it's like whatever, I'm just used
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.580]   to it, right?
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.160]   You know, last week when your kid was like I love you, mommy, like, you don't care, right?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.260]   The most amazing thing in life, if it gets repeated, just becomes boring.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.940]   And that sucks because, you know, you like the most amazing things in life to kind of
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.980]   keep being awesome, it's pretty sad that we don't have it, right?
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.180]   This has a flip side though, which is very good for happiness, hedonic adaptation, which
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.140]   is the most terrible thing in life can happen and over time you get used to that too, you
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.140]   know?
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.500]   So your partner breaks up with you, you find out you have a chronic disease, right?
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.860]   Just something like really bad happens, day one when you find out that piece of information,
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.860]   it is awful.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.140]   But day two, yeah, it's still awful, but that's just your life and then over time it kind
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.140]   of gets better.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.320]   There's a very famous study in the field of happiness science that tried to look at this
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.460]   with people who experienced a really great event in theory, winning the lottery, and
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.100]   people who experienced really bad events, real events in life, becoming paraplegic.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.580]   So you used to be able to walk and now you've lost the use of your legs.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.140]   You survey happiest in people who haven't had these experiences and you ask, predict
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.540]   how bad it would be to have this.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.980]   And people say, you know, day one of winning the lottery would be really great and a year
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.720]   from now, a year from that point, winning the lottery would still be just as great,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   it'd be awesome.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.780]   Same thing with paraplegic, you know, moment you become paraplegic, that day is a really
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.500]   crappy Thursday, but a year from then it's still just as crappy.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.100]   And what you find is people, you know, on the day you become paraplegic or the day you
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.980]   win your lottery, like that's a big shift in your contrast, right?
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.340]   The day you win the lottery is an awesome Thursday, day you become paraplegic is terrible.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.220]   But a year from then, it turns out your happiness is no different from baseline from the day
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.020]   before that event happened, right?
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   Statistically.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.100]   And that is shocking, right?
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.180]   Like I know these results, I can quote the paper, but like if you told me today, "Laura,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.860]   you know, you walk out of the studio, you get by a car, you're paraplegic, how would
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   you feel in 2026?"
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220]   I'd be like, my life is still really crummy.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.620]   But statistically that's just not going to happen.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.180]   What does that mean?
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.000]   That's kind of good news about hedonic adaptation for happiness.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.380]   That means the worst thing possible could happen to you and you have all these processes
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.220]   that are just going to get used to it over time and it's going to be okay.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.620]   And I think this is an important aspect of our psychology that we forget.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.100]   I think sometimes we have opportunities to do things in life that are a little risky,
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.060]   something we might try out that we might screw up or fail at, or that we'll be bad at at
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.060]   first.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.300]   And we don't do it because we're scared, we're making a prediction like, "Oh, well if I failed
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.380]   or if I screwed that up, you know, I'd just be unhappy."
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.220]   But actually all these mechanisms that we have of hedonic adaptation means those things
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.620]   aren't going to affect you for as long as you think.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.900]   So I think the contrast hypothesis about happiness is real.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.340]   Good things don't stay good things over time, but the bad things don't either.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.260]   But we still want the good things to stay good over time and so that raises a question
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.980]   of how we can do that.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.660]   And Liz Dunn, whose work I've mentioned before, she likes to use this phrase that scarcity
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.380]   engineers happiness, right?
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.980]   One thing we can do is space out the good things in life, you know, so if I was having
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.500]   that really delicious, healthy salad with the avocado and whatever, if I had that every
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.860]   day, it would stop being good.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.340]   But if I had it very, very infrequently, it would still be good every time I come back
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.340]   to it.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.060]   And so sometimes, oddly, the way we make ourselves happier is to kind of remove positive experiences,
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.700]   especially extreme positive experiences, kind of space them out so we can kind of come back
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.900]   to them over time.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.500]   I definitely agree with that.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.540]   I also, and forgive me folks, but I think I understand why dogs are so awesome.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.500]   They don't attenuate to reward.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.980]   You tell them they're going to get this little piece of amazing whatever beef jerky or something
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.580]   and they're like, "Yes."
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.740]   Then second trial, "Yes."
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740]   Third trial, "Yes."
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.740]   I mean, presumably at some point they reach satiety or fatigue, but there's something
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.100]   about their reward pathway is that they don't seem to attenuate much.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.300]   And if there's feedback to us on that, it's like, "Okay, okay, it's great that they'll
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.780]   keep delighting in the simple little things."
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.900]   It seems like almost as much as the first time.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.540]   We are not like that.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   It's interesting.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.540]   To my knowledge, people haven't studied eudonic adaptation in dogs, but it's a really good
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   question.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.420]   But we are not like that for most things.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.380]   And this sucks, right?
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.020]   I mean, it's also the case that in addition to kind of getting used to stuff over time,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.060]   it's also showing a different feature, which is the sort of more particular contrast feature
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.060]   you're talking about.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.860]   So over time, we kind of habituate.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.940]   That's one sort of neural mechanism.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.740]   But another is the one that you mentioned, which is about the contrast, right?
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.940]   And that's what you see kind of, you see both of them, say, in the light perception, right?
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.940]   If I show you the same light over time, you're going to habituate.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.940]   That's eudonic adaptation.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.140]   Literally, for folks listening, it literally disappears.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.140]   Yes.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.880]   And if you set up the right experiment, Russ and Karen DeValloy at Berkeley years ago did
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.620]   these beautiful experiments.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.740]   You look at like a grating of light projected onto a wall, and if you can stabilize the
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.820]   eyes so that they're not moving around, it literally will disappear.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.360]   Same thing with an odor, same thing with touch, right?
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.700]   Like I wasn't thinking about my contact with the chair.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.700]   Same thing with happiness.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   My deliciousness.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   It's so sad.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.340]   Habituation, attenuation, these are technical terms when you really get down into it.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.220]   And the push-pull, antagonism between light and dark, the smell, yes/no, on/off, push,
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.100]   all of it, go/no-go.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.860]   Every single aspect of the nervous system functions this way.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.860]   It's a flexor extensor in the musculoskeletal system.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.360]   But that gets to maybe what I would think of as different.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.300]   So eudonic adaptation is the same stimulus over time, like almost like habituation.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.100]   There's a different thing that happens when you get what you might call a contrast.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.300]   And there's all kinds of visual illusions that sort of function on this.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.660]   If you've ever seen the one where it's like, "Is it the same color over here, over here?"
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.620]   And we throw this on your show page to show people, and it's like, "Oh, it looks different."
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.620]   It's like, "No, no, no.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.660]   That's because of the kind of contrast between the two things."
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.740]   You see something that's really bright over here, it makes something else look a little
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.820]   darker, right?
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.700]   That's a different negative effect on our happiness a lot of the time.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.300]   This is the comparison effect, right?
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.540]   This is like my $50 million seems kind of crappy because I hang out with people who
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   have $100 million.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.540]   Objectively, I have a tremendous amount of money, but I feel bad because I'm kind of
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.580]   comparing against something else.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.660]   And so oftentimes when we're evaluating different rewards, we're kind of comparing them against
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.020]   what other people had or what we've had in the past.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.940]   And that means that being in an objectively good situation might feel really crappy if
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.620]   you just have somebody else that has a slightly better objectively good situation.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.740]   My favorite example of this actually comes from the sports world.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.740]   So researchers asked this interesting question like, "How happy are you when you win an
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.740]   Olympic medal?"
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.740]   Right?
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.740]   You're on the stand, you won an Olympic medal.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.900]   And also, who's happiest?
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.660]   So gold medalists is up there, best in the world.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.460]   You might assume they're the happiest, right?
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   And they are.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.460]   They're smiling.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.220]   Researchers analyze this by looking at facial expressions and kind of code the muscles and
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.220]   so on.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.580]   But it turns out they're not the happiest, right?
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.580]   Who's the happiest?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.580]   Well, let's look at this silver medalist.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.580]   Are they happiest?
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.580]   No.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.620]   In fact, actually, if you code their facial muscles, they're showing expressions like
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.380]   contempt, deep sadness.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.220]   It's the same expression you'd make like if your parent died or like, you know, a real
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.560]   terrible grief moment.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.780]   This is the, I don't want to adhere to this, but this is the "second place is first loser"
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.780]   kind of mindset.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.100]   Because the idea is like, you know, who's your major comparison point if you're in silver?
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.020]   You know, 0.2 seconds or something and you would have gotten gold.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.140]   And you're not feeling objectively like you're the second best on the planet.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.220]   You beat, you know, all but one of billions of people on the planet.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.940]   No, you just feel terrible.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.940]   So that's silver medalist.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.460]   What's going on with the bronze medalist, right?
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.860]   There's another person on the stand.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.180]   What's their comparison point?
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.260]   It's not gold.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.940]   They were multiple people, multiple seconds away.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.380]   Their salient comparison is like, by the grace of God, like I'm up here at all.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.340]   I almost like, you know, two seconds the other direction, I would have never gotten up here.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.860]   And when you analyze the bronze medalist facial expressions, they're sometimes even happier
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.180]   than the gold medalist.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.420]   Definitely happier than the silver, who's objectively better, but sometimes even happier
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.580]   than the gold medalist because they're like, "Oh, relative to my comparison point, I'm
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580]   doing amazing."
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.500]   And the gold medalist is expected to get gold the next year or else it's pure reward prediction
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   error.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.500]   Yes.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:13.180]   Especially if they internalize the expectations of the audience, the spectators, excuse me,
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.220]   because if they come back the next year and they're second or third on the podium or not
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.900]   on the podium, it's seen as falling from a higher place.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   Exactly.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.300]   This is a point that I make with my Ivy League students who've been perfect in their grades
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.340]   and perfect at everything to get into a place like Yale, which is like, turns out that's
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.140]   a terrible recipe for happiness.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.020]   The only way forward is stay there, down, or create a new opportunity.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.020]   Stay there, you don't notice, right?
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.660]   Because you're habituated to it, just like the pattern.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.660]   Down feels really bad.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.900]   Like, that's a terrible comparison.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.700]   I often play my students that DJ Khaled song, "All I do is win, all I do is win, win, win."
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.100]   And I was like, all you do is win, win, win would be a terrible way to experience success
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.420]   in life because you just stop noticing it over time if you won.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.100]   And that's messed up because it means when you get, when you finally hit the success
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.980]   that you were striving for, if you just stay at that level, it just stops being good, which
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   sucks.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.620]   And so that raises a different question, which is like, what is a hack that we can do to
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.660]   get away from that?
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.420]   One is to not look for the silver lining, but to look for the bronze lining, ba-dum-bum,
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.860]   which is, you know, you kind of think of reference points that are lower than you.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.420]   I love a good conceptual pun, especially when it's framed in an experiment, so thank you
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   for that.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   Yeah, it's like a big science experiment.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   No, that's especially gratifying to me.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.000]   So look for the bronze lining, which means find a reference point that's not as good.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.540]   And for most of the things you're comparing, whether that's your looks, your fitness level,
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.760]   your finances, you can look and find somebody that's doing worse than you.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.340]   Another great hack for this, and this is more one that's a kind of a hack for hedonic adaptation,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.380]   getting used to stuff, actually comes from the ancient traditions.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.980]   I know you talk a lot about, you know, smart, you know, folks back in the day who came up
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.980]   with this stuff, right?
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.660]   This is one from the Stoic tradition, a practice called negative visualization.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.340]   So Stoics like Marcus Aurelius thought, when you wake up in the morning, you should have
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.660]   the following thought pattern.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.260]   You should think, "Today, I will lose my success.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.740]   I will be exiled.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.740]   I'll lose my partner.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.740]   I will lose my health.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.740]   I won't be able to walk."
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.860]   And he doesn't say ruminate on that for forever, but just like a little, and then stop and
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.660]   say, "Ha, I'm not exiled.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.660]   I still have my success.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.180]   I still have my partner," and so on.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.860]   This is a technique called negative visualization, where you just imagine, you don't have to
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.660]   live it in real life, you just imagine you lose something.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.220]   If you've ever lost something you're hedonically adapted to, you know how quickly you recognize
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.220]   the value of it.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.220]   This happens to me with my phone all the time.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.620]   I'm a chronic phone loser, and I'm like, you know, and I'm like, "Oh my God, my phone is
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   gone.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.620]   I left it in the airport.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.140]   All my contacts are there," and then I'm like, "Oh, it's in the car," and he goes, "I love
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.140]   my phone.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.140]   Like, it's so valuable to me."
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.660]   There's that line in Pulp Fiction where he says like, what is it?
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.060]   It's like it's finding – at some point, I think it was Travolta says something, someone
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.940]   will know it, where finding it almost made losing it worth it.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.940]   Exactly.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.740]   Because you appreciate it in a way that you didn't before because it was taken away from
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   you.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.740]   Yeah, and that sucks to really lose your phone.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.060]   Sometimes, in my case, you really lost the phone, right?
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   Sure.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.060]   But negative visualization, you don't have to do that.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.260]   You just use your imagination, right?
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.740]   And so if you're listening right now and you have a kid, let's do this negative visualization.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.260]   The last time you saw your kid was the last time you ever saw them.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.260]   Oh, goodness.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.260]   Never going to see them again.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.260]   No, it didn't happen.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.260]   So I'm a little intimidated about it.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.780]   But my guess is the next time you hug your kid, you'll hug – just that two seconds
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.740]   of thinking about what things would be like without it can break through hedonic adaptation.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.540]   So one of my favorite hacks for hedonic adaptation, you can use scarcity, really space things
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.540]   out.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.020]   But for the things you can't space out, you can't like have a kid and get rid of a kid
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.140]   for two weeks and come back to your kid, right?
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.300]   You can use your imagination, and it doesn't take much to start to realize what you have
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.340]   and appreciate it more.
