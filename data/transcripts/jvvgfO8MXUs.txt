[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Let's get rolling right away with today's deep dive.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.540]   I'm calling it the two types of ambition.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.120]   Now this deep dive is based off of an article
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.480]   I posted to my newsletter at calnewport.com
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.960]   just a few days ago.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.000]   So the original title of the article,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.120]   and I have it on my screen here
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.960]   for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.760]   The original title of the article was
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480]   On Michael Crichton's Busy Ambition.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360]   It's from October 28th.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   So the motivation for this article,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.660]   which I wanna pick apart in our deep dive today,
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.160]   was actually coming across a profile of Crichton
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.000]   in the New York Times archives from 1970.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.200]   And I have this on the page now on the screen
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800]   if you're watching, a profile that's titled
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400]   For Michael Crichton, Medicine is for Writing.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.540]   It's also a picture of a young Michael Crichton there.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.880]   So what struck me when I read this profile recently
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.480]   was the busyness of Michael Crichton
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.800]   at this very early stage of his career.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.020]   So let me set the scene for you.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.160]   This is the scene that I opened the article with.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.280]   All right, it's Michael Crichton,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.400]   his last year at Harvard Medical School.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.720]   He's 26 years old.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.000]   He goes to the dean of the medical school,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.720]   and he says, "I don't think I'm gonna practice medicine.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.340]   "I've figured this out, but what I do wanna do
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.720]   "is publish a nonfiction book about hospital life,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.320]   "in particular, the hospital in Boston
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   "where he was doing his intern rounds."
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.680]   And he asked, "Can I, instead of doing
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.920]   "some of the normal whatever work you would do
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.540]   "during your final semester, can I instead
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.520]   "go around the hospital and gather research for my book?"
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   And here's the actual quote I have here
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.440]   from this article, which was written
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.560]   one year after this occurred.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   He said, "Why should I spend the last half
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.420]   "of my last year at medical school
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.140]   "learning to read electrocardiograms
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.080]   "when I never intended to practice?"
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.760]   All right, so he says this to the dean
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.060]   of Harvard Medical School.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.840]   The dean replies, paternalistically,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780]   "Michael, I don't think you realize
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.400]   "how hard it is to write a book."
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.160]   Right, so he's trying to warn this young kid,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   like, you can't just go walk around the hospital
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.000]   and gather some notes.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920]   This is when Crichton did his mic drop
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.140]   and revealed to the dean of Harvard Medical School
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.280]   that he had already published four books
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.240]   during his first three years at medical school.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.520]   He had been doing so under the pen name John Lang,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.840]   L-A-N-G-E.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.460]   Not only had he written those four books,
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.620]   but he had multiple other projects in action,
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.240]   not just this nonfiction book idea,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.120]   which he had already started, by the way,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.760]   but his first two, I would say,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.860]   serious publication efforts.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.440]   His first four books are potboilers.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680]   I've read 'em, you can buy 'em, they reissued them
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.760]   under Michael Crichton's original name.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.120]   They're Clive Kustler, James Bond-style thrillers
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.140]   with some techno flavor added in.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.480]   But he was also, by this final year of his med school,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.100]   deep underway with some more serious books,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.320]   the first being A Case of Need,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.240]   which he published under a pseudonym as well,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.120]   but it was really the first thriller he wrote
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.680]   that got medicine more deeply involved.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   This would win, that next year,
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400]   it would win an Edgar Award
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.560]   for Best Mystery Novel of the Year.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.440]   It's a hard award to win.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.760]   He also was working on The Adronoma Strain,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   first book he would publish under his own name,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.040]   and of course would be a big breakout bestseller.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   It's what really started his fame in the literary world,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.400]   became a big movie back in the '70s.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.800]   He had all this stuff already going on
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.100]   when he went to talk to the med school dean.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.580]   So by the time you get to a year later
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.820]   when this New York Times profile is written,
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.520]   you see that this is a one-man multimedia operation.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.820]   So in addition to all of those projects going on,
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.000]   he somehow has two more potboilers,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120]   he writes under his pseudonym, by 1970.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.160]   So somehow he adds two more books
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.320]   unrelated to A Case of Need,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   unrelated to The Adronoma Strain.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   He also, by this point,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.320]   was working on what would become The Terminal Man,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   his second techno thriller written under his own name.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.200]   It was called something different.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.800]   The profile, they're still calling it The Sympathetic Man,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.520]   like the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.240]   but Terminal Man is much better.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.440]   He revealed that he was already intent
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   on directing the movie for The Terminal Man.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.680]   So he was concurrently writing a screenplay.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.760]   He was also traveling to Hollywood every week
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.560]   on what he called, and I'm highlighting this here,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.440]   a skills-building gambit.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   So he was going to Hollywood.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.760]   He's trying to pick up,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520]   because he wanted to be a director as well.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.720]   And so he was going to Hollywood a couple days a week.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.660]   So this was the year after he left medical school.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.400]   So he had this sort of half-hearted post-doc
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.340]   at the Salk Institute in La Jolla.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.680]   La Jolla, J-O-L-L-A.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.920]   - Hoya. - Hoya, is it La Jolla?
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.760]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   Which is not far from LA, I guess.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   - So he was going back and forth.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.080]   - It's like San Diego area.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.840]   - Yep, all this stuff was going on.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.300]   27 years old, all this was going on at the same time.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.920]   The New York Times profile
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.140]   called his career hyperactive.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.360]   And it is, can you imagine that?
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.640]   I mean, I do a fair amount of things.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.800]   That's crazy, the amount of things he had going on.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.920]   So all these different projects,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.240]   he was juggling at the same time.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.960]   Oh, and by the way, he also published a novel
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.160]   with his brother under a pseudonym
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.000]   between 1969 and '70 as well,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   an experimental novel about drug dealing,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.280]   where they would pass the manuscript back and forth,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.880]   and he would write an entire draft,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.200]   and then his brother would edit an entire draft.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.100]   All this stuff's going on.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.560]   So, busy guy.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.040]   I compared him in this article,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.780]   let's say apples to apples,
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.200]   another really successful fiction writer, John Grisham.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   John Grisham's younger.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.400]   He really got his start in the early '90s,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.880]   whereas we have Crichton getting his start
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.440]   in the early '70s, but whatever, same idea.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.560]   And there was a period in the '90s
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.420]   where they were competing back and forth,
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.400]   not just for the biggest book sales.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.940]   Grisham and Crichton for a period in the '90s there
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.360]   were in a huge war on movie rights.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.040]   They were breaking deals, breaking records for movie deals,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.080]   and their agents would say things like,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.180]   "I want whatever Crichton got for his last book plus $1."
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.960]   Like they were trying to one-up each other.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.320]   All right, so what's John Grisham's story?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   So John Grisham in the 1980s is a lawyer,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.400]   small-town Mississippi lawyer.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.200]   He runs for and also wins a seat
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.440]   in the Mississippi State Legislature.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.880]   So he's a Democrat state legislature
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.480]   and a small-town lawyer doing both of those things.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   State legislator's a part-time.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.360]   Job.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   And he decides he wants to write a book.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He gets an idea for a book from a case
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.240]   that he wasn't trying, but was observing.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.320]   And he gets this idea for a book and he tells his wife,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.880]   "I wanna try to write a legal thriller."
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.600]   And she said, "Okay, but do two in a row."
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.440]   Right?
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.880]   So that way, maybe one of the ideas doesn't work.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   You have two shots at it right away.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.200]   And if both of those ideas don't work,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.280]   then you know that maybe that's not for you.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.000]   So he does this.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.840]   It's hard.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.520]   It takes him longer than it takes Crichton.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.200]   I have the numbers in here,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.680]   but I think it was something like three years.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.080]   Because he's writing in between these two jobs.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   And you can find him in some interviews talking about,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.080]   "Oh, I have my notepad while I was waiting for meetings.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.240]   "I was waiting for a legislative session
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   "to begin, I had scribble notes."
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   But I found a really definitive interview
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.040]   where he said, "This is the secret.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   "I woke up at five and I wrote every morning.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   "And it was really hard and I was often really tired.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.260]   "And it wasn't like all that fun.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.800]   "And that was the only way to really make progress."
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.120]   And it still took him three years to write the first book.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.920]   He started the second book
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.320]   the day after he finished the first.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.880]   Good thing he did that because the first name,
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.680]   the first book, "A Time to Kill",
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.020]   he had a hard time finding a publisher.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.080]   When it came out, small first printing did nothing,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   disappeared.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.280]   But he had already basically finished his second book
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.120]   by that point.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   So he's like, "I might as well."
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.600]   This time, his second book, which is "The Firm",
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.200]   his agent leaked bootleg copies of the manuscript
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.640]   to movie producers.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.080]   So before they had even sold the book,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.300]   Paramount came in and said, "We'll pay you $600,000
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.780]   "for the movie rights for 'The Firm'."
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.680]   So then once the publishing industry heard
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.280]   that Paramount had paid 600,000,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.120]   they're gonna do a big movie,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.880]   which they eventually did with Gene Hackman and Tom Cruise.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   Doubled A snapped up the book rights for a lot of money.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.760]   That book got a lot of coverage, went on to sell a lot.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.200]   The number I quote in the article is 7 million copies.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.840]   I couldn't really source that well.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.100]   It might be less than that.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.000]   But anyways, it sold a lot of copies
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.880]   instead of his whole career.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.000]   This is where, and I say in the article,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.220]   Grisham's path diverges from Crichton.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.640]   Grisham does not look at the buffet
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   of appealing opportunities that is generated
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.480]   by his initial success and say, "Let's start feasting."
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.940]   He does something very different.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.080]   He says, "I now have the leverage and money
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.380]   "needed to simplify my life in a way I couldn't before."
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.920]   Stops practicing law, leaves the legislature.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   Based on the advice he heard from a bookseller
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.920]   that all the big fiction names published once a year,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.180]   he said, "That's what I'm gonna do.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.220]   "One book a year, that's what matters.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.300]   "Especially in the beginning,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.660]   "I need a book every year to solidify my audience."
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.800]   And he basically retreated into just a writing routine
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.400]   of one book per year.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.160]   And I have some of the details of it
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.340]   because he's talked about this before.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.400]   Here's how he eventually perfected this,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   I would call it almost monastic writing routine.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.480]   He starts writing on January 1st.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.820]   He works three hours a day, five days a week.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.080]   He used to write in their Oxford,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.240]   then he moved to Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.340]   They have a farm, he has an outbuilding on that farm
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.720]   that they renovated for him to write.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.360]   No internet connection there.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.180]   First thing in the day, three hours.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.640]   He basically writes till lunchtime.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.560]   Five days a week, not on the weekends.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.100]   That rhythm has him finish the first draft,
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.360]   usually by March.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.400]   The editing begins.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.420]   He wants to have the manuscript
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.480]   completely locked in by July.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.000]   Starts in January, six months later,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.280]   done with the manuscript.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.120]   Now that's it for writing until the next January.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.840]   Now he'll think and do research
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.260]   about what his next book is gonna do at his own pace.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.360]   He will do, clearly, publicity.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.980]   He usually does fall releases.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.760]   So when that book comes out in the fall,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.300]   he'll do publicity, but he's not a big publicity guy.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.240]   He does limited tours.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.760]   He'll do the big shows and interviews
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.080]   and then retreats again back to his farm.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.000]   And that's kind of it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   He doesn't do these other projects.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.360]   He doesn't wanna direct.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.520]   He doesn't wanna do 17 different types of books
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.800]   like Crichton was doing.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.240]   He wasn't trying to establish a production company
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.840]   or get involved in television.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.640]   They would sell the movie rights to his books,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.600]   but that was about it.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.680]   15 hours a week, six months out of the year.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.100]   The rest of his energy goes to other things.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.480]   When he had younger kids,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.000]   he was really into Little League baseball.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.360]   And so he built,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.040]   it's not officially associated with Little League,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.480]   but a youth baseball complex.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.280]   Five really great fields.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.360]   They started their own youth baseball league.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.840]   He was the commissioner of the league.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.680]   He loves baseball.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.500]   He loves coaching.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.080]   He thinks it's great for kids.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   I know he's heavily involved
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.320]   in political fundraising as well.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.240]   He just has other stuff that he does.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.540]   So I found an article and I can't excavate this anymore,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.280]   but I remember finding this and reading this.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.680]   And I wrote about this somewhere.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.540]   I can't find where.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.840]   So I can't find the original source,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.320]   but you'll have to take me at my word for this.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.060]   At some point, this was an article
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.600]   from probably the last 10 or 15 years,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.440]   his longtime assistant retired.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.080]   And he realized, according to this article I found,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.560]   that he didn't need to hire a replacement
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.520]   because there was no work for her to do.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.280]   I mean, his agent has his number.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   His editor has his number.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.360]   They know his routine.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.920]   He's not involved in a lot of projects.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.480]   He's not involved in a lot of schemes.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.080]   So there was nothing for the assistant to even organize.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.520]   He writes from January to March,
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.360]   edits from March to July,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.560]   does a one-week publicity tour in the fall.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.600]   So anyways, very different than Crichton.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.680]   Crichton says, "I now have success.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.040]   "I wanna go do lots of different things."
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.340]   Grisham says, "I have success.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.560]   "I wanna simplify my life."
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.840]   So what I did in this piece
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.960]   and what I wanna do right here
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.780]   is try to put names to these two different approaches
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.440]   to ambition.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.960]   So what I write in the article is,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.200]   the first model exemplified by Crichton
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.000]   is what I call type one.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.260]   It craves activities and feasts at the buffet
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.720]   of appealing opportunities that success creates.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.880]   The other model exemplified by Grisham
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.340]   is what I call type two.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.320]   It craves simplicity and autonomy
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.020]   and sees success as a source of leverage
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.960]   to reduce stressful obligations.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.020]   Medical school wasn't sufficiently stimulating for Crichton.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.740]   Life as a lawyer was too hectic for Grisham.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.160]   They therefore reacted to their success
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.420]   in much different ways when it respectively arrived.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.440]   Now my argument is this is a spectrum,
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.200]   but most people fall towards one end of the spectrum
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.480]   or the other, the type one Crichton end
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.560]   or the type two Grisham end.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.040]   And that it's important to understand
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.600]   where you fall on the spectrum
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.320]   because it will have a big impact
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   on not only how you plan your professional
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.620]   or aspirational endeavors,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.360]   but how you react to successes when they come.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   If you don't have this figured out,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.720]   you can end up in a mismatch situation.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.060]   If you're a Grisham that allows the pressure
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.360]   of your success to push you into a bunch
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.060]   of Crichton style projects, you're not gonna be happy.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.080]   If you're a Crichton and you use
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.200]   your first book taken off to move
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.760]   to the middle of the woods,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.040]   I can finally now live in the house in Maine
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.800]   overlooking the water, you might be bored.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.000]   You might be depressed.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.680]   You say, what I'm just isolated up here.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.600]   This doesn't make me happy.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.440]   So understanding where you fall, I think is important.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.800]   And that was the call I made in that article.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.080]   Recognizing those are two very different types
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.960]   and they're both valid, I think as in itself,
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.200]   very validating for people.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.120]   So when you're doing something
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.000]   like lifestyle centric career planning,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.120]   you have some clarity.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.920]   So the final question is where do I fall?
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.320]   Well, in the article, I was really clear.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.020]   Grisham is what resonates with me.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.880]   I got some pushback though.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.120]   People say, you say Grisham resonates with you,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.800]   but your life looks more Crichton-y to us from the outside.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.360]   And I think that's a very good point.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   And I guess what I would say is
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.600]   that I'm aspirationally Grisham.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.480]   I mean, to me, being able to work autonomously
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   on a hard project on my own terms, on my own timings
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   to disappear for a while and just come back
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.320]   into the public eye occasionally, that really resonates.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.480]   When I read that profile of Crichton, it stressed me out,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.940]   made me anxious.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.240]   So I think I resonate more times Grisham-y.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.340]   Now it looks like I'm doing a lot
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.900]   and partially that's true.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.080]   I'm probably a little bit more into Crichton spectrum
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.000]   than where I need to end up,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.760]   but partly it's an illusion
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.720]   because I do things sequentially.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.340]   I work on things a little bit at a time.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.140]   This is classic slow productivity, a little bit of time,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.720]   but with great focus, do that long enough
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.020]   and things begin to pile up,
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.520]   but I'm not necessarily working on all those things
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.800]   at the same time.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.080]   I think the podcast, newsletter, video portion
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.600]   of my empire makes my activity seem really multiplied,
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.160]   but as Jesse will attest, this is a half day venture for me.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.480]   So the way I see all of this,
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.360]   like what you're hearing right now is unlike Grisham,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.720]   I'm a web 2.0 guy.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.860]   I grew up with the internet.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.680]   So I do like to be able to connect directly
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.440]   with my readers and listeners.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.800]   To me, that's really important, but I keep it confined.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.960]   And so I just have a burst each week
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.520]   of let's do a bunch of stuff to connect with our readers,
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.600]   but it's confined.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.640]   It's not a lot of ongoing projects
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.920]   that are eating up a lot of my time throughout the week.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.640]   So if you put that aside, it's basically writing in CS.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.080]   And if I had to pick an ideal,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.680]   where would I be when I sell 7 million copies of "The Firm"
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.080]   or whatever my equivalent is,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.000]   honestly, to me, an ideal would be I'm always writing,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.600]   I'm always thinking sequentially though,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.960]   one thing at a time, I'm finishing this book chapter,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.400]   then I'm writing this New Yorker piece,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.840]   then I'm writing this academic article,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.200]   then I'm writing a couple more book chapters
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.520]   with a half day every week where we do this nonsense
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.120]   so that I'm not just living in a cave.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.680]   To me, that would be great.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.720]   I'd be happy with that.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.080]   I don't need to be directing
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.320]   or whatever the equivalent is of all of Crichton's business.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.480]   So anyways, type one, type two, know where you are,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.240]   use that knowledge to help direct how you approach
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.560]   both your ambitions and your successes.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.600]   And I think it'll make people a lot happier.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.200]   - Do you think Crichton's still like that?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.160]   - Well, he's dead.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   So he's the ultimate.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.000]   - Oh, right.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.960]   I was thinking, yeah.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.520]   - Yeah, so Crichton died in '08 maybe, cancer.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.360]   Yeah, he's older.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.440]   By the way, I'm always surprised by how old he was.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.000]   Well, we talked about this before on the show,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.080]   but you read his first book under his own name,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   "The Adronoma Strain," which again, reads so modern.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.320]   You think this book was from the '90s.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.560]   And yet in the book, no one's landed on the moon yet.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.720]   So that's a long career.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.200]   So when he first started writing these things,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.040]   there were no personal computers.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.720]   We hadn't landed on the moon yet,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.600]   because he was born in 1942.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.000]   - Yeah, I was getting confused with Moneyball.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.840]   - Oh, Michael Lewis.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.480]   Yeah, I wonder what his deal is.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.280]   So he has a podcast with his buddy, Gladwell's Network.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.960]   He writes, usually he's always working on a book.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   I thought he had one of these sort of visiting,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.640]   like professorship things at Tulane for a while.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.800]   I mean, I know that's what Isaacson's doing.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.840]   I think Meacham is doing that.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.320]   A lot of these writers, like these sort of,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.440]   that generation came out of magazines,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.400]   now they're in their 60s, Pulitzer-winning writers.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.360]   A lot of them have these positions at universities.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.800]   But yeah, I think Lewis is a good example.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.520]   I think he's just like, "I just wanna write."
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.360]   - Yeah, I know both.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.920]   The whole time I was just thinking about Lewis
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.160]   for some reason, I don't know why.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   - Yeah, why don't you go down that rabbit hole too?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.740]   (upbeat music)
