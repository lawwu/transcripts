[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   - My name's Josh Findley.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.080]   I'm a retired special agent from Homeland Security.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920]   - For the people listening,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.360]   what exactly is Homeland Security?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.520]   - It would be similar to what you would think of as an FBI.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   I have done undercover things into white supremacy groups,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.920]   selling arms overseas into different organizations.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.960]   I've sold children.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   I've bought children, all of those things.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.080]   - You're under Homeland Security.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.960]   Homeland Security is the team that invaded Diddy's house.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.800]   - Yes.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.960]   - Do you have any knowledge on that situation?
