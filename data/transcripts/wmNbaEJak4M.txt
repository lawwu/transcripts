[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   A Christian man who was dying of cancer writes in to ask, "Pastor John, two days ago I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I always felt that because I'm a follower of Christ, I would not struggle immensely with my mortality,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   but in all honesty, I feel an awful emptiness as the end is near.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I so want to not waste this. I want to be joyful, but I'm afraid that I will fail in this final test.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And after reading your book, "Don't Waste Your Cancer," I just can't grasp how you would consider this a gift.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Any counsel would be appreciated.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to this man?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Well, there are sudden changes in life, like a phone call from a doctor that I remember and that he's now gotten.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And when you walk into a new land, a new territory, a new neighborhood,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   it's not immediate that things come into focus.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   In other words, I'm trying to cut this man a lot of slack that the sheer newness of the land where he just landed
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   is not yet in clear biblical focus for him.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's strange. He's disoriented, and he's trying to get his bearings, and I regard his question as a tuning of his compass.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And so if I could help him tune his compass, then I would be happy.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   But I don't think he should despair quickly that his spiritual bearings have been jolted,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and he's off balance right now, and he needs to find his balance.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So that's what the Word of God is for.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And I'll just share a few things that are huge in my orienting myself in this world,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   especially when the world becomes very, very fragile.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The first thought is that the world is not my home as it is now, and therefore I want to cultivate a love for heaven.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   As Paul said, our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Set your mind on things that are above.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   When Christ appears, your life will appear with him.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So we wait for a Savior who's coming to transform our lowly body into a body like his glorious body,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and we should simply see that even though God's going to redeem this world,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   it's not as it is now our present home, and we should cultivate a kind of freedom from at-homeness here.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And threats of death are a great help in that regard.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And the second thing I think of is that this body of his that is now threatened,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and mine that is threatened and growing old, is going to be made radically new.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That was in that same verse from Philippians that Christ is going to transform our lowly body to make it like his.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   In fact, he's going to set the whole creation free from its bondage to corruption,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   so that the very things that we don't want to lose here, all the ones that God thinks are good for us,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   we're going to get back.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We're going to get all the relationships back.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   We're going to get the pleasures of this world back, only beefed up a million times and stripped of all sin and imperfection,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   so that the sense of loss is only temporary in that God is going to restore us a thousandfold what we have laid down to go to be with him.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And then I think it helps a tremendous amount if we can realize that God works, because of Christ, everything together for our good.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I know many people think Romans 8:28 is overworked, which is one of the reasons why I love to linger on Romans 8:32,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   that "He who did not spare his own son, will he not give us all things with him?"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   If he gave his son up, won't he give us all things graciously with him?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Which means that when Christ died for me, God did the hardest thing possible,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and therefore it will be easy for God to give me everything that I need.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That getsâ€”that's Psalm 84, and that gets right at the question he asked.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He said, "John, how can you see it as a gift? How can you see the loss of your physical life as a gift from God?"
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And it doesn't really matter how I see it until I see the Word, because I have to see everything with the eyes of God.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And God's eyes say, "No good thing does he withhold from John Piper in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I bought you. You are my own. You are my child. I do nothing for you that's not good for you."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So I only can believe that if I linger long over the Word of God.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And then, maybe lastly, would be to say that loving Christ and loving the glory of Christ and the grace of Christ has to be supreme.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   When Paul said in 2 Corinthians, "We would rather be away from the body,"
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   he said it because the next phrase was, "and at home with the Lord."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And if we don't love the Lord supremely, that won't be a comfort to us.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And when he said, "To live is Christ and to die is gain," the reason to die is gain, he said, is because it's to be with Christ,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   which means that we've come to treasure Christ above all things.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We've said with Paul, "I count everything as loss for the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So when you get this thorn, and I think threats of death and cancer and every other kind of thing that comes at us to take our lives is like the thorn in 2 Corinthians 12.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   If we love Christ supremely, we'll be able to say with Paul, "For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with,"
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and then he lists off weaknesses and insults and hardships and persecutions and calamities,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and this is a calamity for this man. Nobody's going to minimize it. It's huge. It's painful.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You cry about it. You ought to cry about it. Your wife is going to cry about it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   If you're married, your kids will cry about it. All that crying is appropriate because it hurts.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But if Christ is supremely valuable, then our affections are transformed, and we love his glory, his grace, and his presence more than we love this life.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So I think my answer, Tony, in a nutshell is we immerse ourselves in the Word of God
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   because our Word and our perspective is always going to be worldly, but God's Word and God's perspective is going to be eternal,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and if we can adapt to his perspective, then we can actually walk through these sufferings in a way that makes much of Christ.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. The book Don't Waste Your Cancer can be downloaded for free at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Also, in a previous Ask Pastor John podcast in episode 21 titled "What Does Christian Hedonism Offer the Depressed?"
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Pastor John shared the testimony of a woman who lost her battle with cancer at age 40
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and her beautiful testimony in the last days of her very painful death.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   [silence]
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   [silence]
