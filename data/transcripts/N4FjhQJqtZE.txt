[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Well, why does Christ want some to not believe?
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.160]   That's a perplexing question for a lot of Bible readers who scratch their heads when
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   they meet texts like Matthew 13, 13 and Luke 8, 10.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.200]   Today, the question arrives from a listener named Max, a question for Pastor John, who
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440]   joins us again over Skype today.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.760]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.280]   Can you explain Jesus' parable in Luke 8, verses 9 to 15, in which he quotes Isaiah
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.280]   6, 9?
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.520]   In Isaiah 6, God says to "make the hearts of this people calloused, otherwise they might
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.220]   see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and be healed."
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.400]   What perplexes me is that God purposefully keeps people from salvation, even though 1
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   Timothy 2, 4 states that God wants all people to repent and receive salvation.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.920]   Please help me to understand this seeming paradox, and if possible, God's reasoning
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.280]   behind hardening certain hearts to keep them from repentance.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.920]   Pastor John, what would you say to Max?
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920]   There really are two questions here.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560]   They're both good.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   One is, does 1 Timothy 2, 4 imply that God's desire for all to be saved rule out, does
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.640]   it rule out his decisive sovereignty over who is in fact saved?
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.880]   So if he desires all to be saved, are you going to draw the inference, well, then he
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.520]   can't be involved in choosing some to be saved and some to pass over and not be saved?
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   That's one question.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.920]   The other question is, what is God's reasoning or purpose behind preventing some people from
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.200]   seeing the truth and being saved in Luke 8?
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.760]   Now let's take those one at a time and then relate them.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.560]   1 Timothy 2, 1 to 4 goes like this.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.120]   for kings, all those who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   godly, dignified in every way.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.680]   This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.360]   to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.760]   So this text raises the question, if God desires all people to be saved, why are not all people
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   saved?
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.320]   That's the question.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.240]   And the typical modern, and by modern I mean the last two, three hundred years, the typical
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:03:01.440]   modern answer is to say that man's free will, his self-determination, keeps God from doing
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.560]   what he desires to do, namely save them.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680]   Now I don't think that's a biblical answer.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.200]   I think that's a philosophical presupposition brought to the text and taught nowhere in
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.760]   the Bible.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.000]   I don't think man has that kind of free will, that kind of self-determination that can thwart
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.120]   God's sovereign will to save whomever he pleases by overcoming their hard heart and their resistance
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.060]   and rebellion and giving them a new heart of faith.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.640]   In Paul's teaching, faith is a gift of God, not a creation of man out of his own ultimate
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   self-determination.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:53.600]   It's not a product of free will understood as self-determining power.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.320]   You can see that in Philippians 129, you see it in Ephesians 2.8, but you see it especially
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.660]   in Acts 13.48, where Luke says that it is those whom God has chosen and appointed who
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.240]   will actually believe when they hear the gospel.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   It goes like this.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.580]   This is Acts 13.48.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.080]   The Gentiles began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.840]   appointed to eternal life believed.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   So I take this to mean that human self-determination is not the ultimate explanation for why all
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.240]   people are not saved.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.520]   Even though Paul says God desires all people to be saved in 1 Timothy 2.4, in fact, Paul
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.800]   says as much in these very letters to Timothy.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.960]   For example, in 2 Timothy 2.25, he says this, "The Lord's servant should correct his opponents
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.160]   with gentleness.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:10.440]   God may perhaps grant them repentance unto a knowledge of the truth."
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.560]   Now that very phrase, "unto a knowledge of the truth," is the same exact phrase used
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:27.280]   in 1 Timothy 2.4, where God desires all people to come to a knowledge of the truth, which
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.100]   not all do.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:37.000]   So on the one hand, God desires all to come to a knowledge of the truth in 1 Timothy 2.4,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.940]   and on the other hand, it says he may perhaps grant as a gift that some particular people
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.380]   will come to a knowledge of the truth, 2 Timothy 2.25.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:59.600]   So I think Paul makes it clear that what hinders God's desire for people to repent and come
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.240]   to a knowledge of the truth, what keeps it from rising, what keeps that desire for all
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   to be saved from rising to the level of decisive action in which everybody would be saved,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   is not the power of human self-determination, so-called free will, but rather the fact that
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.840]   God may or may not grant repentance and faith.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.620]   At one level, God desires all to be saved.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.000]   He does not delight in the death of the wicked, Ezekiel 18.23 says, but another commitment
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   in God, another commitment to act with wisdom and justice and a wider love, love seen through
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.360]   a wider perspective, a wider lens, prevents him from acting on the desire for all to be
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   saved in a way that saves all.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:06.980]   So in reference to Max's question about Luke 8, about God's choosing not to liberate some
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:14.700]   from their rebellion and spiritual blindness, what we have seen so far is that this is not
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.280]   a contradiction of 1 Timothy 2.4, where God desires all people to be saved.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.440]   He desires it, but he doesn't always perform it.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.120]   And Max is asking, "Well, please help me understand God's reasoning behind the hardening of certain
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.420]   hearts to keep them from repentance."
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.660]   And then he quotes Luke 8, 9 and 10.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:45.320]   It says this, "When Jesus' disciples asked him what the parable of the sower meant, he
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.440]   said, 'To you it has been given.'"
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   So it's a gift.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440]   They don't deserve it.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.680]   They didn't earn it.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.760]   "'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom, but to others they are in
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:06.140]   parables so that,'" and here's the divine purpose, "'so that, seeing they may not see,
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.560]   and hearing they may not understand.'"
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:18.840]   And Max sees rightly that this is an allusion to Isaiah 6, 9 and 10, where God gives Isaiah
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.220]   the painful task of preaching with the effect of hardening.
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:31.780]   So he says this, God says, "Go, Isaiah, say to this people, 'Keep on hearing, but do not
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.040]   understand.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.900]   Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.940]   Make the heart of this people dull and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes.'"
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.060]   This is God telling Isaiah what his preaching is going to do.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.780]   "Blinding their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, lest," this is his purpose, "lest they
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.940]   see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.900]   and be healed."
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:08.220]   So the explanation of hardening in Isaiah's and in Jesus' ministry is that this design
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.140]   of God's Word is judgment.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.980]   It's judgment upon sin.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:22.380]   This dulling, hardening effect of the preaching is not happening to people who love the Word
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.380]   of God.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.580]   He's not going out and finding people who love and submit to the Word of God and then
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.060]   preaching so that they become hard-hearted.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.060]   No, no.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.700]   No one is made blind against their will.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.220]   Mark that.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.140]   This indifference to God is what they want.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.620]   There's nobody kicking and screaming, moving into blindness.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.460]   "I want to see."
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.420]   There are no innocent people under the judgment of God's blinding.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.580]   None.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.780]   Nobody is made blind to God who loves to see God.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.940]   This blindness and dullness are judgments for sin.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.700]   They are the handing over into blindness to be blind.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.340]   Now I'll end with this.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.020]   Where is this judgment leading?
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.540]   What's the big picture?
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:23.500]   And Paul tells us in Romans 11, 25 and 26, he says to us Gentiles, "Lest you Gentiles
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.940]   be wise in your own sight."
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.740]   I don't want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:41.620]   A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles, that's us, and
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.100]   the great world mission of the church, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.260]   And then in this way, all Israel will be saved.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.860]   It's leading to salvation.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:02.740]   And then later in that same chapter, verse 32, he says, "God has thus consigned all to
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.420]   disobedience that he may have mercy on all.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:13.160]   Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.900]   How unsearchable are his judgments.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.260]   How inscrutable are his ways.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.820]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.580]   To him be glory forever and ever.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580]   Amen.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   Amen.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.260]   Thank you for walking us through an answer to this very common and very perplexing question,

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.420]   Well this spring during quarantine, my youngest son and I have taken up a new hobby.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.580]   We go outside in the darkness, lay down, stare straight up into the dark Arizona sky and
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.340]   look at the dazzling stars.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.620]   The more our eyes adjust, the more stars we begin to see.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.260]   So as we look up, what do we see and hear in the night sky?
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.340]   You'll hear from Pastor John on that theme next time on Wednesday to explain what the
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.780]   creation is saying to us about the creator.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.340]   We'll see you then.
