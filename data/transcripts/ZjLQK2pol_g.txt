[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.720]   I'm Cal Newport and this is "Eat Questions" episode 199.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.600]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   No Jesse today.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.780]   That's my fault, not his.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.120]   I missed our last recording session.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.200]   I had some travel and then I had a touch of the COVID.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.400]   I was thinking about waiting
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.160]   until our next recording session to record this episode
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.560]   in the next back to back,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.240]   but I wanted to get this out as quickly as possible.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.120]   So as soon as I could break free from isolation,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.960]   I ran over here to try to knock out this episode.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.620]   It'll be a little bit late this week,
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.260]   but hopefully not too late.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.700]   So since it was just me,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.040]   I figured what if we did a blast from the past?
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.160]   What if I actually structure today's episode
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640]   the same way I used to structure the podcast
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.740]   back in the very early days
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.680]   when it was just me recording out of the study in my house.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.960]   Back then as long time listeners might remember,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.560]   I would do only written questions in the main episodes
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.420]   and I would divide them into three categories,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.740]   work, technology, and the deep life.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.180]   Over time that then became just deep work and deep life.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.160]   And then over time we got rid of the categories
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.600]   for questions altogether.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.560]   And now of course we have this much more,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.720]   let's say vibrant structure where there's written questions
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.880]   and voice questions and segments
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.300]   where I'm talking about different things.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.040]   And I use the Telestrator, we go through articles
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.500]   and there's a lot more that goes on in today,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.360]   but let's go back to the past.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.600]   Questions all written three categories,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.580]   deep work, technology, and the deep life.
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.320]   Before we get into that though,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100]   let me give you a quick update on my book writing.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.840]   So as you know, I'm working on a new book.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.120]   Let's see, what book is this for me?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.480]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   This is my eighth book.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.080]   Okay, so I'm working on my eighth book,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.800]   slow productivity.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.720]   And I wanna give you an update on how that's going.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.280]   I have two observations I wanna make
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.840]   about the last week or two of working on this book.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.920]   Observation number one,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840]   there was a period of roughly five days
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.640]   in which I was not on my game.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.960]   So some combination of mild sickness symptoms
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   plus disruption in the household,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240]   a little bit of travel disruption early on in that period.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.000]   There's a period of five days where I was not on my game,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.520]   where I was full energy writing in my normal routine.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   During those five days, I still wrote.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   Because it's what I do.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.560]   I write every day except for Shabbat
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.640]   and I feel uncomfortable when I don't.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.200]   So I still wrote, disrupted or not,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.880]   I still wrote every day in these five days.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.600]   And I spent all five days working on the same section
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   of the new book.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.160]   Now by section, let me give you quickly a survey
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.560]   of the hierarchy of sections in the book.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   Right now I'm doing a three level hierarchy.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.240]   So you have numbered chapters.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.080]   Numbered chapters are pretty long in this book.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.400]   They could be 10,000 words plus.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.200]   Numbered chapters are then broken down into named sections.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   So these are sections that each deal with a certain topic
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.760]   and have a title, sort of a bold headed title.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.920]   And then sections themselves are broken down
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.440]   into subsections, which are broken up
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.240]   with just horizontal divider symbols.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.100]   All right, so those are the three levels of hierarchy.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.720]   So I was working on a section,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.280]   which in other types of books might be roughly the length
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.680]   of what you might call it a chapter.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.880]   But again, I call it section.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   Same section.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.080]   And I'll tell you exactly what the section was.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.720]   I chose it 'cause I thought it'd be pretty straightforward
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.560]   to write.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.640]   It was talking about in the broader context
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.000]   of doing fewer things,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   I was pushing the notion of having a pull-based workflow
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.560]   instead of a push-based workflow.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.360]   Where a push-based workflow is where anyone can put work
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.220]   onto anyone else's plate whenever they want
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.080]   by just sending out a message or grabbing them
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   or saying, "Hey, can you do this?"
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.600]   So all of the work in this particular professional context
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.720]   exists spread out over different people's list.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   In a pull-based workflow, by contrast,
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.760]   you only work on a small number of things at a time.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.580]   When you finish something,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.320]   you can then pull something in to replace it.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.740]   So actually in a pull-based context,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.480]   most of the work exists in some sort of centralized,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.460]   external place.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.480]   And work is only pulled on the individual plates
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.400]   as they have the free cycles.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.960]   The same amount of work gets done,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.760]   but you get rid of the overload on people's plates.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.640]   Anyways, I was getting into this idea
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.080]   and I had a really good case study
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.440]   I really wanted to get into from the MIT Management Review.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.880]   And it felt like it should be easy to write.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.280]   Five days I worked on this and was all over the place.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.160]   This thing was getting long, it was rambling.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.960]   And my instinct of, is this clicking,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.560]   is this clear, is it aspirational, was all a fritz.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.380]   Did it feel good about it?
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.440]   Five days, starting to make me nervous.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.260]   All right, fast forward, feeling better,
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.920]   have my structure back, I can write in the morning again.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   In two sessions, I rewrite that whole section from scratch,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.600]   complete confidence, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   This is right, this is clear, great.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.600]   Two sessions, I redid all of the effort
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.080]   I'd put into over five days
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.880]   and turned up with something much better.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.120]   So the reason why I'm bringing this up
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.880]   is that I think it underscores the degree
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.180]   to which context matters for doing cognitive work.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.440]   Having a good routine, your structure,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.720]   this is when you write, your mind is used to it.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.880]   Being at your full physical capacity
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.120]   when you're doing cognitive work,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.480]   all of this stuff matters.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.880]   Not all work is made equal when it comes to your brain.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.720]   And so when I was working under duress,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.040]   yeah, I could put down words, but they weren't very good.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.720]   When I was on my game, I was a much better writer.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.280]   So I thought that was an interesting observation.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.480]   I think it's an observation that is relevant
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.880]   for anyone doing cognitive work.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.400]   We don't think about the degree to which
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.120]   being in a disrupted or unusual
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.080]   or fragmented type of cognitive landscape
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.240]   can really draw down just the sheer ability
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.760]   that you are able to express.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.400]   So I thought that was interesting.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.800]   The other thing I would mention,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.920]   just another update on writing slow productivity
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.620]   is so I'm working on this first big chapter
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.840]   about doing fewer things.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.280]   First big chapter I'm writing,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.120]   not the first chapter in the book.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   There's a whole first part to the book
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.080]   that motivates and explains the ideas.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.560]   And the second part's a little bit more pragmatic.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   So it's this first big chapter I'm writing on,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.040]   but it's from the second part of the book.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.100]   Overall, it's taken me a long time.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.400]   I've thrown out a lot.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.360]   I'll write 5,000 words, cut that down to 2,000.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.520]   I've changed the outline three or four times.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.340]   And the point I wanted to make about that is
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.900]   that is expected as well,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.120]   at least in my experience,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.240]   when you're working on the first major chapter
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.060]   of a new book, it will be by far
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.400]   the slowest chapter that you write.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.040]   And the reason is, is you're finding the voice of the book.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.720]   It's something we don't talk about a lot,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.960]   but I think is really important.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.840]   What's the pacing?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.620]   What's the tone?
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.320]   What's the type of information you pull in?
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.360]   What is the voice in which you present this information?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.520]   Is it didactic?
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.960]   Is it journalistic?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.560]   How tight are you breaking up sections
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.960]   or how rambling is it going on?
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.120]   Is this a clear transition book or let it hang?
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   All this stuff has to be worked out and it's all feel-based.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.440]   There's no way to get around it except for the right,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.760]   throw it out, redo it, stare at it,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   say, is this really clicking?
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.600]   It's okay, but could it be better?
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.080]   And you do that until you love it.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.680]   And it takes a long time, but you know what?
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.060]   At least I'm hoping this is true
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.000]   'cause it's been my experience.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.160]   The next chapter you write goes twice as fast.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.840]   So that's my update on my book writing.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.480]   One other quick point I wanted to make,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.780]   one other quick announcement.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.680]   In a recent episode, we talked about,
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.180]   Jessie and I talked about an article
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.240]   about someone running for,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.040]   I believe it was the city council in Toronto
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.540]   and how she was not using any social media.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.600]   She said, "I can use tech to connect to my constituents
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.640]   "without having to be on Twitter,
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.240]   "without having to be on Instagram."
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.280]   Anyways, I was pronouncing her name wrong
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.120]   and I'm not sure why.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.500]   She sent me a note.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.920]   Her name is Siri, S-I-R-I,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.840]   spelled like Siri, the voice assistant for Apple.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.820]   So I really have no excuse
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.160]   for some weird pronunciation I made up.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.280]   Maybe it was just, I was assuming,
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.400]   well, it can't be pronounced like the voice app.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.580]   So Siri, my apologies,
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.700]   but I will wanna correct a record now
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.180]   about how to pronounce your name.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.040]   If you haven't seen that clip, we put it on YouTube.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.140]   It's called something like a novel solution
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.340]   to social media in politics.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.260]   Go check that out, youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.140]   And you can see the article and just in your mind,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.140]   correct that name to the correct pronunciation
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.180]   as you listen.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.180]   All right, so we got three batches of questions here,
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.180]   all written old school style, work technology,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.580]   and the deep life.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.820]   I'm excited about that.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.380]   Before we get rolling into that,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.140]   let's quickly talk about a couple of sponsors
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.740]   to make this show possible.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.020]   The first is a new sponsor,
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.020]   but one I am excited about, 8Sleep.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.300]   Particular, I wanna talk about the Pod Pro Cover by 8Sleep.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.460]   This is the most advanced solution on the market
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.380]   for thermoregulation.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.620]   So this is a cover you put on top of your mattress,
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.580]   on your bed.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.380]   It hooks up to this cool looking machine.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.780]   My kids are really impressed by this.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.420]   They think that we have some sort of robot bed now.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.380]   And there's little channels in it.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.420]   And I don't know exactly how all the technology works,
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.900]   but it's able to move cooling or heating,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.020]   I guess it's fluid through these channels
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.180]   to control the temperature of your bed.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.380]   You can make your sleeping surface as cold as 55 degrees
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.020]   or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.540]   You can have different temperatures
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.460]   for the different sides of their bed as well.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.580]   Here's why this is important.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.980]   Temperature matters for sleep.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.380]   If you're not at the ideal temperature,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.260]   it is hard to sleep.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.300]   I am particularly sensitive to this.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.660]   I blast myself with a fan while I sleep
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.220]   because I need to try to bring my temperature down.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.860]   So for me, the Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover is fantastic
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.140]   'cause I can bring down not just the temperature
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.180]   around my head with a fan,
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.300]   but the entire mattress surface I am on
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   to a cool temperature.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.620]   It really does help me sleep.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.780]   Particularly important, let me just say,
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.820]   this is a non-theoretical observation.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.380]   This is a concrete observation.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.860]   If you have COVID, you will have hot periods at night.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.700]   Not a bad time to have a Pod Pro Cover to help cool you down.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.620]   They have stats.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.300]   The Eight Sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.940]   reduce sleep interruptions by 40%
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.860]   and get overall more restful sleep.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.780]   So we have stats, but you'll know it if you try it.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.540]   The Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.140]   So go to eightsleep.com/deep
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.540]   to check out the Pod Pro Cover
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.900]   and receive a discount at checkout.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.260]   Eight Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.380]   and the UK.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.540]   So that's Eight Sleep,
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.060]   spell out the word eight,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.820]   E-I-G-H-T sleep.com/deep
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.340]   to check out the Pod Pro Cover
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.340]   and get a discount for being a listener of my show.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.900]   All right, that's a new sponsor.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.820]   Let's also talk about a longstanding sponsor,
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.660]   Blinkist.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.060]   You know my argument, ideas are power,
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.900]   especially in today's knowledge-based economy.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.820]   The best source of ideas are books
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.860]   'cause books represent concentrated thought,
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.940]   years of concentrated, careful thought
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.340]   crystallized into an efficient format.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.780]   The difficulty is figuring out which books to read.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.940]   We only have so much time.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.260]   That's where Blinkist comes in.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260]   Blinkist offers a selection of nonfiction books
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.380]   over 5,000 titles in 27 categories
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.020]   that they have reduced down to 15 minute summaries
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.860]   that they call Blinks.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.620]   You can read them or listen to them on the go.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.940]   This allows you to very quickly figure out
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.620]   what the big ideas are in books.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.520]   The way I recommend using this
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.180]   is if there's a topic you're interested in,
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.800]   read the Blinks of three or four books from that topic.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.780]   Now you know the lay of the land.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.780]   Now you know the big ideas.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.780]   Now you know which of those books, if any,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.780]   are worth actually buying and diving into in more depth.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.340]   I wanna add that Blinkist also now has Shortcast,
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.580]   which are quick summaries of podcast.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.500]   So now you can get summaries of both books and podcast.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.560]   All right, so 5,000 titles, 27 categories.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.580]   I mean, I was looking at there the other day.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.540]   They have multiple books on blockchain.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.180]   We're gonna talk about that later in the show,
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.660]   but if you wanted to quickly get up to speed on blockchain,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.060]   what it is and its impact,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.540]   read the Blinks of three or four of those books.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.100]   That's probably will be enough.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.700]   And if not, they'll tell you which of those books
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.320]   you should probably buy.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.300]   Should you buy "The Blockchain Revolution"
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.380]   or just the book "Blockchain"?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.140]   Blinkist can help you make those decisions.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.820]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.380]   just for our audience.

[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.640]   All right, let's do some work questions.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:07.280]   Our first question comes from Bethany who writes,
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.660]   "I'm a private music teacher.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.920]   So I teach voice and piano lessons online
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.940]   and from my house.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.340]   I find that my friends and family
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.200]   don't take my profession very seriously
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.300]   and feel that they can ask me to do things
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.180]   like run errands for them or go for coffee
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.780]   or sometimes they just come over at any time
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.820]   because I quote, only work 20 hours a week, end quote.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.040]   When in reality, I work more like 40
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.100]   because of admin work, prep time, product development,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.180]   you know, small business stuff."
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.420]   Well, let me tell you, Bethany, the ultimate solution here.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.440]   I don't know if this is possible for you right now,
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.000]   but I wanna throw it out there.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.900]   Don't work from your house.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.880]   I wrote a blog post just a couple of days ago
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.600]   where I went back and revisited an article I wrote a year ago
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.440]   for the New Yorker about this phenomenon
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.840]   I called work from near home.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.640]   And the idea is if you are remote,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.440]   that is you're a worker who does not need to go
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.340]   to a centralized office to get your efforts accomplished.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.000]   There's a real value to having a space for your work
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.720]   that is not your house.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.320]   It's not a home office in your house.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.120]   It is not a table in your house you use for other things.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   It is somewhere else near your house.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.440]   You don't have to commute.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.960]   It could be a shed in your backyard,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.920]   or like I do, leasing low cost office space
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   in your nearby downtown.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.680]   I have a relative who's a writer who leases an office space
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.920]   which is actually a basement.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.840]   It's a basement in someone's house.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.000]   So it could be like a simple basement apartment.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.700]   He rents it as an office, whatever,
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.480]   but a separate place that you go to work.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.680]   Now in that original article, in that New Yorker article,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.920]   I focused to try to highlight this phenomenon.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.600]   I focused on famous writers.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.880]   And I said, look, if you go back and look
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.840]   at the work habits of a lot of famous writers,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   you'll see a lot of them that have very nice home offices,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.440]   nice houses, nice home offices, don't work in them.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.280]   They write near their home, but in eccentric locations,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   in locations that are often clearly less nice
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.960]   than their home offices.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.520]   And I gave a bunch of examples.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.680]   Maya Angelou used to do this.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.320]   She would go and write in hotel rooms.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.180]   She would write on the bed.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.180]   She'd prop herself up on her elbow and work on legal pads.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.720]   She would take the artwork off the wall.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   She wanted to be completely blank, zero distraction.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.040]   She even developed a callus on her elbow
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.440]   from how much she would, or how long she would prop herself
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.060]   up on that elbow in the hotel room.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.380]   It was different than her house.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.360]   Peter Benchley, author of "Jaws."
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.040]   When he wrote "Jaws," he lived down the street
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.160]   from where I grew up.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.680]   So I know the house well that he lived in
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.000]   during the time when "Jaws" was written.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.760]   It's a beautiful carriage house on a half acre of quiet land.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.440]   He didn't write there.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.920]   He would write "Jaws" in the back room
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.200]   of a furnace supply company.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.840]   I know from contemporary interviews that it was loud.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.840]   Bang, bang, bang.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.460]   They're working on furnaces.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.560]   Much worse space, aesthetically speaking,
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.080]   functionally speaking, than his home office.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.920]   But he went there.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.320]   John Steinbeck would take a portable writing desk
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   on a boat out into the middle of Sag Harbor.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.060]   He lived near Sag Harbor during some parts of the year,
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.880]   right in the middle of the water.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.920]   I found a new example.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.280]   So the blog post I wrote a few days ago
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.960]   was about a new example I came across.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.640]   Jack Carr, the adventure novelist,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.680]   writes the James Reese novels.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.280]   He lives in this beautiful house in Park City, Utah
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.440]   that overlooks the forest.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.840]   I found photos of him online doing some work in this house
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.480]   with floor-to-ceiling glass.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.840]   He also has a well-decorated home office
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.600]   that he records his podcast out of.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.760]   When he was working on his new book, "In the Blood,"
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.240]   he rented an old beat-up cabin
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.160]   in the same town from Airbnb,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.800]   an old beat-up cabin to go right.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.240]   We had to chop his own wood to fire
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.280]   in the wood-burning stove.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.760]   It had two rooms in it, basically.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.600]   Again, much less nice than his house,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.440]   but he would go there as well.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   So what's going on here?
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.960]   Well, home is where the familiar is,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.680]   and the familiar lays a lot of cognitive traps.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.040]   Our mind is semantic.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.720]   Our mind is associative.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.840]   It sees something
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.760]   for which there's salient mental connections.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.200]   It's gonna fire up a lot of related networks in the brain.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.040]   You see the laundry basket.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.280]   There's a lot of networks to get fired up about chores
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.800]   and what needs to be done.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.240]   Your kids run by, okay.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.300]   There's all sorts of networks coming up
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   about what they're doing,
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.120]   what needs to happen later in the day.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.760]   It is a cognitively difficult environment to get work done.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.160]   So writers would flee their homes.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.000]   They could have an environment
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.320]   that was associated just with work.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.040]   They could focus better.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.120]   They could get more work done.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.440]   So I am a big believer
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.040]   that remote work doesn't mean you have to be in your house
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.280]   because your house is probably a particularly bad place
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.520]   to actually get things done.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.440]   So consider if possible,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.680]   and this is not just to Bethany,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.280]   this is for anyone listening.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.760]   If you are remote,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.160]   consider investing money in having a place to work
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.200]   that's not your home.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.680]   I think we're too quick to dismiss this option.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.440]   Some people can't afford this, but a lot of people can,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.320]   but they think it's superfluous.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.280]   Like I have a home office.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.080]   Why would I do that?
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.160]   This is why.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.360]   You will be able to focus much better.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.000]   You'll be much more concentrated in your work.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.080]   You will be much better at your job.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.920]   All right, so Bethany,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.360]   that's what I would recommend if you could.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.540]   You have a place you go when you work
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.100]   and then you're home when you're home.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.260]   Everyone in your family,
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.760]   your friends will get that conviction.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.280]   Oh, Bethany's not at home.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.960]   She's at work.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.500]   Okay, so she can't run errands for us.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.340]   When is she home?
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.560]   Oh, she'll be home at four.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.400]   Great.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.020]   Now we can stop by.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.860]   Now we can see if she wants to come with us to the store.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.300]   All right.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.420]   So that's the ultimate solution there.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.900]   Now, Bethany, you might not be able to do this
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.060]   because you're a music teacher.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.020]   So if you're doing piano or something like this,
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   well, you can't necessarily find another location
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.140]   that has a piano.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.920]   So your fallback solution here
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.540]   is gonna be having a clear work schedule every day.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.500]   In particular, I would have a block of time.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.560]   It's like nine to 12 or nine to one,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.340]   where you can just train everyone in your life.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.540]   During that period when I'm not in lessons,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.140]   I'm doing admin.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.800]   I run a company, a music instructional company.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.020]   There's a lot of things that come along with that.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.240]   That's what I do in my mornings.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.420]   I might have a lesson or two in there,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.300]   but mainly that's what I do.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.220]   I can never do things before 12.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.560]   And then after that, you can still schedule lessons,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.700]   but you're a little bit more flexible.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.180]   After that, yeah, if I don't have lessons,
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.140]   I might be able to run an errand or to hang out with you.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.940]   So I think that repeated clarity,
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.140]   these are work hours, these are work hours,
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:54.980]   you do that for a few weeks,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.220]   they'll stop bothering you during those periods.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.020]   So I have this bigger argument here that
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.180]   remote workers in general
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.180]   should heavily consider working from your home.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.860]   And Bethany, what I'm saying for you in particular
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.100]   is if you need to work from your actual home,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.620]   have this clear schedule that doesn't change day to day,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.620]   that you're definitely not available during those hours
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.660]   and then just teach those around you well.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.500]   All right, our next question comes from
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.740]   momtobee who says,
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.980]   my husband and I are expecting our first child in June.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.540]   So congratulations, we're in June now.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.780]   You submitted this question a while ago,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.420]   so you may even have this child with you
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.180]   right as you hear this.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.740]   We are both full-time knowledge workers.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.540]   I am planning to take four months leave.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.660]   Once I go back to work,
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.860]   my husband is planning to take 10 to 12 more weeks of leave.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.980]   Once we are both back at work,
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.220]   the baby will be in daycare two days per week
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.540]   and with my mom three days per week.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   My husband works remotely full-time
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.300]   and I work in an office three days a week.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.420]   I am curious if you have any advice for us
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.460]   on navigating parental leaves
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.900]   and a return to work afterwards
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.720]   in order to keep performing well at work.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.220]   Enjoy having a new baby and keep our sanity.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.500]   Many thanks.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.860]   Well, first of all,
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.460]   I think it's cool that you're able to do sequential leaves.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.380]   So you take a leave, then you go back to work,
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.820]   your husband takes a leave or he's a primary caregiver,
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.820]   then he goes back to work
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.860]   and that's when the baby goes into daycare.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.080]   I think that's great.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.140]   Both caregivers now get familiar early on
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.620]   with taking care of the baby.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.180]   That's obviously critical.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.900]   I mean, people don't turn to me
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.220]   that often for parenting advice,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.960]   but I will say if you have one member of the partnership,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.080]   not learn early on how to take care of the kid,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.460]   it causes troubles down the line.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.660]   So I think that's really cool.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.380]   The people I know who did sequential leaves
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.460]   always say the same thing,
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.300]   which is I'm really glad that we did it.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.440]   And Georgetown didn't have a policy.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.660]   They don't really have a paternity leave policy.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.420]   They do have a policy that if you are the primary caregiver,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.700]   so let's say, so if you have the baby,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.900]   you get a semester off paid, which is fantastic.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.780]   Let's say that your wife had the baby and you didn't.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.260]   You can argue that you were gonna be the primary caregiver.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.020]   So like if your wife had to go back to work full time,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.060]   you could as the partner take a full semester off,
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.340]   all paid, which is actually a pretty cool policy.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.840]   But when we were having our first kids,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.900]   my wife was working like four days a week
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.460]   instead of three or something like that.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.580]   And so we could not argue that I was the primary caregiver.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.260]   So I never got to take advantage of any leaves,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.040]   but I was able to arrange for either sabbaticals
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.740]   or buyouts or research fellowships for all three kids.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.020]   So I was able to do something kind of similar
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.980]   to really be around, really be around for a while
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.100]   when the kids are young, it's really cool.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.140]   Okay, so what's the key here
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.280]   when you both are going back to work?
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.700]   My big argument about kids and work is clear separation.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.900]   Have clear work hours, schedule shutdown complete,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.020]   then family hours.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.820]   When you work, you work, that's what you're doing.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.700]   When you're not working, you're doing family stuff.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.960]   That's what you're doing.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.820]   This is why that early period of the pandemic
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.360]   where especially in the blue states,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.100]   they kept schools closed forever
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.660]   was really a dumpster fire from a work perspective
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.940]   because we mix those two things together
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.380]   and pretended like we weren't.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.460]   Like, well, your kids are, you know,
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.620]   they're doing Zoom school and you're kind of working.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.460]   It'll all be fine.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.480]   You have Zoom, what's the problem?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.060]   Well, the problem is those are two different jobs
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.240]   you're trying to do at the same time.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.940]   And it was chaotic and it was terrible
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.700]   and it burnt everybody out.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.580]   And we pretended like it wasn't a huge problem,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.860]   but it was a huge problem.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.980]   And it underscores what I'm recommending,
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.840]   the importance of what I'm recommending to you now
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.340]   is the key to working with kids
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.880]   is you have work and you have non-work.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.160]   When you're working, that's all you're doing.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.160]   You're trying to do as well as possible.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.600]   When you're not working, all you're doing is family
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.840]   and you're trying to do that as well as possible.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.240]   So when you go to the office, that's really clear.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   You're at the office, you're working.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.400]   When you're home, you're not.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.960]   Your husband has to be really clear though,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.240]   working from home.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.560]   This is when my work starts.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.080]   And then this is when it's over.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.580]   Don't try to mix those two things.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.640]   The kid is in daycare
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.840]   or the kid's being taken care of by your mom.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.300]   They are not your responsibility
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   until you're done with your work.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.900]   I think that separation is key.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.660]   By the way, in an earlier question,
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.580]   I talked about how we underestimate the value
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.020]   of having workspace near your home
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.500]   that's not actually in your home.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.820]   This is a clear example where that would be very useful.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.780]   If you at all have the financial resources,
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.720]   the lease is sort of, doesn't have to be fancy,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.660]   just lease some office.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.500]   And I got to tell you,
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.620]   there's nothing more available right now
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.320]   than commercial real estate.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.840]   Your timing is good.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.060]   Lease an office, spend 500 a month.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.720]   If you can swing it, it's worth it.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.300]   You can get to have this clarity,
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.020]   even on work from home days.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.060]   When I'm there, I'm at the office.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.220]   When I'm here, I'm home.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.220]   I can't think of any more powerful cognitive snare
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.700]   than hearing the sound of your baby.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.660]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.780]   You need to be on your game
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.960]   from a productivity perspective while you're at work,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.680]   because you really cannot or don't want work
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.960]   to bleed out of the work hours,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.980]   especially when you have a young baby at home.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.860]   So this is a good time.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.060]   And you mentioned in your elaboration,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.860]   you guys are big believers in multi-scale planning.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.680]   You have your quarterly plan, you have your weekly plan,
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.580]   you have your daily time block plans,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.340]   you have full capture on your Trello boards.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.660]   Just be on your game with that.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.340]   You wanna be very organized,
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.140]   really clear in scheduling and setting expectations
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.360]   so that you can keep work constrained.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.280]   I will also say, ramp down your ambitions for the next year.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.820]   So for the second half of 2022 into the first half of 2023,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.860]   you're not trying to be a superhero.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.340]   You're not trying to crush it at work.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.260]   You're trying to not be a pain for people,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.500]   be organized, get stuff done,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.820]   but you need to go easy on yourself.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.900]   You have a long career ahead of you.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.580]   This is not the year for you to try to make that move,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.700]   to launch the new business,
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.940]   to try to get the new promotion.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.180]   This is a time to go a little bit easy,
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.860]   to go a little bit easier on yourself
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.820]   and be okay with that.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.460]   It's one year.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.940]   One year, your career will be fine,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.740]   but also there's things that are just as important.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:21.020]   And then finally, the advice I always give new parents,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.140]   if you both work, you have to sleep train the kid.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.200]   All right, they're not gonna magically
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.840]   sleep train themselves.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.100]   They'll get over it.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.300]   Everyone in the family has to sacrifice.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.820]   To keep the lights on, the food on the table,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.740]   you have to get work done.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.560]   If you're gonna get work done,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.420]   you cannot have a baby waking up four times a night.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.060]   So you're gonna have to sleep train that child.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.180]   All right, let's move on.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.920]   Now, I always worry when I give that advice
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.460]   that parents are gonna yell at me
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.720]   because it's kind of a fraught topic.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.220]   Sleep training, it's controversial.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.460]   No one ever actually yells at me.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.820]   So maybe Deep Questions listeners
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.300]   are on board with sleep training.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.920]   All right, our next question here comes from Freddie.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.220]   Freddie says, "Is the following understanding
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.500]   of deep work durations correct?"
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.100]   All right, then he goes on to elaborate.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.500]   "When deep work is geared towards deliberate practice,
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.140]   something like learning how to program,
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.060]   only four hours can be sustained per day
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.880]   since deliberate practice is inherently not fun
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.040]   when you're stretching your abilities.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.820]   However, when deep work is geared towards work
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.420]   that can generate a flow state,
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.580]   something like writing computer programs,
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.240]   it can be extended to eight hours or maybe even 10."
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.960]   So Freddie, that's more or less correct.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   So that four hour limit that I mentioned in my book,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.600]   "Deep Work," really came from a study
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.000]   of deliberate practice.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.720]   It was actually an Anders Ericsson paper
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.560]   studying violin players.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.840]   I've also seen anecdotally this four hour limit
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.520]   confirmed by other, in particular, professional musicians.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.040]   So practicing a musical instrument
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.080]   at the professional level is a very intense act
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.200]   of deliberate practice.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.280]   You're not just playing things,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.680]   you know you're stretching your ability,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.880]   you're trying to perfect.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.840]   And the standard schedule that Anders found,
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.880]   and I've heard other people talk about as well,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.840]   is two hours break two hours, adds up to four hours.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.080]   So that's correct.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.320]   Other type of deep work, yes, you can do much longer.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.560]   So remember, for something to be counted as deep work,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.840]   it needs two attributes.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.040]   It has to be cognitively demanding,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.560]   so it can't be trivial.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.160]   And it has to be done without distraction,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.360]   so no context shifting.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.760]   You're giving your full attention to the effort,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.920]   you're not also checking email,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.120]   you're not also checking your phone.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.600]   That covers a lot of activities,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.760]   include a lot of activities though,
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.280]   that though not super simple,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.600]   because it has to be cognitively demanding,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.440]   are things you could do all day long.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   Right, a lot of deep work is not nearly as intense
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.200]   as a professional musician trying to push their skill
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.280]   to the next level.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.600]   So yes, most deep work you can do much longer than four hours
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.720]   Even deliberate practice,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.040]   most people can do longer than four hours
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.680]   'cause they don't do it nearly as intensely
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.760]   as professional musicians.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.680]   I think most people are just not familiar
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.920]   about how cognitively intense real practice actually is.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.480]   In my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.160]   I try to capture this with an anecdote
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.520]   where I went and spent time
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.240]   with a professional guitar player.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.040]   And I wrote about what it looks like
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.240]   to watch a professional guitar player practice.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.120]   In this case, the player, Jordan,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.680]   Jordan Tice is his name, actually he played at my wedding.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.480]   Jordan was practicing with such intensity
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.880]   that he would forget to breathe.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.560]   And then he would have a ragged gasp
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.680]   as he sucked in air, his body forcing to suck in air.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.680]   That's what it looks like when you're deliberate practicing
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.960]   at your full extent.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.520]   That you can't do more than four hours,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.080]   but most people aren't anywhere near that level of intensity.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.840]   So typically what I tell people is,
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.440]   don't fret too much about these limits for deep work,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.560]   numbers or thresholds, you're fine.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.880]   Just make sure you're doing deep work on a regular basis.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.200]   Don't be distracted, focus on the hard things,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.100]   do that regularly and good things will come.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:11.920]   All right, we got one more work question here.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.120]   This one comes from Ledbetts who says,
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   "Hi Cal, I recently bought your time block planner.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.000]   I am so overwhelmed with everything
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.300]   I wanna get accomplished, practice Java for work,
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.160]   pay off debt, exercise, lose weight,
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   declutter my spare room, take a Spanish course.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.920]   How do I utilize the planner to time block my workday
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.780]   and add in the additional goals?"
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.720]   So Ledbetts, when we're talking about goals,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.040]   we need to divide these into two categories.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.160]   Projects versus ongoing efforts.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.400]   So exercise that you talk about here is an ongoing effort.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.120]   I wanna exercise on a regular basis
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.200]   so I can be in better shape.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.120]   That's an ongoing effort.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.120]   It's not something you do once and then you're done.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.480]   Whereas decluttering your spare room,
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.360]   by contrast, is a one-time project.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.440]   It's something that you wanna do and then it's done.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.680]   Let's deal with both of these types of goals separately.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.400]   Let's start with ongoing efforts.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Here you're gonna wanna do
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.720]   some sort of habit stacking methodology.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.560]   Let me simplify this a little bit.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.140]   Start with a keystone habit in the relevant area.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.700]   So if you really wanna get in good shape,
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.400]   start with a keystone habit related to health and fitness.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   Now, keystone habits means it's something you do every day.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.600]   It's tractable, so it's something you can actually
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   probably do every day.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   You know, 10 pull-ups every morning, 5,000 step walk,
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.120]   but it's also non-trivial.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.040]   Like it actually takes a little bit of effort.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.640]   And you wanna do that every day.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.880]   In each of these areas that's important to you
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.720]   that you have some goal, start with a keystone habit.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.680]   This might not be enough to actually accomplish
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.040]   the particular goal you have in mind,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.680]   but it gets you used to it.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.840]   Where does the time block planner come into play here?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.880]   Use the metric tracking space
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.080]   on the daily pages for every day.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.000]   You can track, did I do my keystone habits every day?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   There's a real power to seeing that
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.560]   you don't wanna break the chain.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.280]   There's a real power to actually be able to write down
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.920]   that you did it.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.800]   There's a real urge to try to avoid
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.080]   not being able to write down that you did the keystone habit.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.600]   So use the metric tracking space
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.840]   to keep up on those keystone habits.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.320]   Once you're doing those regularly,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.360]   you will have rewired your psychology
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.720]   into one that says for these areas of my life,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.840]   I'm willing to do optional but important work
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.800]   again and again, even when it's not easy.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.640]   That will change your self understanding.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.880]   You are now someone who spends time on these things
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.400]   like in this case, fitness.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.840]   And it's important to you and you're proud of it.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.320]   Now you can upgrade the habit.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   All right, so I have that keystone habit.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.200]   Now that I'm used to that,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   now let me get into the more intense workout routine.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.480]   Then I'm gonna do three days a week
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.840]   or there's something I do every day.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.240]   Now I have this 30 minute block before lunch every day.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.280]   And I go back and forth between rows and exercise
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   and whatever.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   Now you can put in the more intense habit
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.320]   because you've rewired your brain
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.120]   to be someone who makes,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.880]   to see yourself as someone who makes progress
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.280]   on those areas of your life on a regular basis.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.960]   So start with the tractable keystone,
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.040]   track it in your planner,
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.480]   upgrade once you're used to it.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.520]   All right, what about projects
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.560]   like decluttering your spare room?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.720]   Well, here's where you wanna actually leverage
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.920]   the full multi-scale planning stack quarterly, weekly, daily
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.400]   your quarterly or we sometimes call strategic plan
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.120]   is where whatever that goal is might first show up.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.080]   You know, this quarter,
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.480]   I want to clean my room
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.680]   and I wanna take a Spanish class.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.920]   So when you get your weekly plan for each week,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.960]   you look at your quarterly plan,
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.320]   you know what you're trying to make progress on.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.160]   You can say, well, is this a week
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.080]   that I have time to do that?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.960]   And if it is, get that time into your weekly plan.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   And I would recommend at this point,
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.240]   putting it onto your actual calendar,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.680]   the same calendar that you use to track your appointments
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.960]   and existing meetings.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.080]   Because when you then do your daily time block plan,
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.280]   every day you look at your calendar to fill in stuff
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.320]   already on your calendar into your time block plan.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.480]   And that project work time will get automatically moved
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.240]   right into your daily time block plan.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.880]   So maybe you're doing your weekly plan for the week,
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.120]   you see decluttering your spare room is on there.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.640]   The week seems kind of reasonable.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.160]   You say, this is the week I do it.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.360]   Tuesday, you're gonna stop work at four
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.720]   and work on the room for two hours.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.960]   Let me put that on my calendar.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.160]   Then I am going to Friday evening, finish it.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.280]   And I'll put that on my calendar.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.840]   And then when you get to Tuesday,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.320]   you look at your calendar as part of making
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.000]   your daily time block plan, your time block plan,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.040]   or you just block out that time.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.840]   When you get the Friday,
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.120]   you're making your daily time block plan.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.680]   You look at your calendar as part of that process.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.520]   You see what's on there.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.280]   You put it on your daily time block plan
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.640]   and you just execute your blocks each day.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   The work gets done.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.760]   Same thing with something like a Spanish class.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.640]   So when that's on your quarterly plan,
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.520]   I wanna take a Spanish class.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.960]   You can come up with a persistent plan for doing that.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.640]   Like for the next four weeks,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.240]   I work on this during lunch hour
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.800]   on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.840]   And that's just sitting there in your quarterly plan.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.080]   So when you make your weekly plan, you block off that time.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.280]   And again, when you get to every day,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.320]   it goes on your time block plan and the work gets done.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.120]   So the time block planner by itself cannot give you
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.680]   everything you need to accomplish goals,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.040]   but it could be a big part of a goal accomplishing framework.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   For people who don't know about the planner,
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   go to timeblockplanner.com.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.420]   You can watch a video where I explain how it works.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.060]   There is a version 2.0 coming out that is spiral bound.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.920]   Again, we're just being delayed by supply chain issues.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.780]   There's a lot of backups in the global publishing
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.440]   supply chain, but the whole thing is designed
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.900]   and we're ready to go to the new format.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.880]   So I would say, don't bother waiting
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.800]   because you'll be done with your current time block planner
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.520]   in three months anyways.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.640]   But just know if you're using a planner
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.540]   and want the lie flat, it is coming, we are working on it.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.380]   All right, let's do some technology questions.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.560]   Now I said questions,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.660]   but it's probably more accurate to say question
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.000]   because I only have one technology question.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.600]   I only selected one because it's big and open-ended.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.760]   It comes from Miranda and she asked,
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.500]   what are your thoughts in general about AI,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.860]   machine learning and where technology is headed?
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.880]   So we haven't done a good open-ended technology question
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.720]   in a while.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:41.900]   Well, Miranda, I'll tell you where the focus seems to be,
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.200]   at least in popular online conversation in the media,
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   there's a lot of focus on crypto, social media and AI.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.360]   Those seem to be big topics.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.880]   So let's go through those briefly one by one.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.320]   All right, so let's talk about crypto.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   As you may have heard me talk about before,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.660]   my personal belief is that the hype around crypto
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.520]   is a little bit excessive.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.120]   So there's a political element to crypto
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.000]   that's based around trust and power and control.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.200]   This idea that these distributed ledgers
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.600]   implemented by cryptographic protocols,
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.080]   that these distributed ledgers
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.760]   are not controlled by a single government
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.380]   or controlled by a single company.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.320]   And therefore there can be coordination
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.280]   and information sharing on the internet
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.800]   that is not beholden to the censorious efforts
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.560]   of individual organizations or countries.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.160]   So there's a crypto,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.200]   a sort of techno libertarian political argument
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.400]   for what you gain from this decentralization.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.800]   I don't think most people care about that.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.480]   I don't think, I think it's important for certain people
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.560]   who think a lot about this, but for the average consumer,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.840]   they don't care about that, right?
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.280]   So that by itself is not that strong,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.160]   but if you take out the techno libertarian
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   political justification
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.740]   for crypto based ledger technologies,
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.120]   there's not something else there
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.680]   that we don't already know how to do much better
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.520]   or much faster.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   We know how to have consistent distributed data stores.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.720]   This is what distributed databases do.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.880]   This is easy to implement.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.200]   So it's not like there's a new technological capability
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.000]   that is introduced by crypto based blockchains.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.700]   It's just, there's a decentralization that comes with it.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.380]   And the value of that is largely political,
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.500]   not technological.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.920]   So again, I think most consumers don't care.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.300]   They don't really care whether the data
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.300]   for this app they're using is stored in the cloud somewhere
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.460]   in just a virtualized SQL database system,
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.260]   or if it's implemented by an Ethereum blockchain.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.300]   It looks the same to them,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.660]   and they don't really care about
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.980]   which way this is being implemented.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.200]   Now for a while, there was an argument
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.060]   about the particular aspect of crypto
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.460]   that is the currency aspect.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.460]   So all of these ledgers, or not all of them,
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.340]   but open ledgers are almost all based
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.560]   on there being some sort of underlying currency.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.920]   And there's some thought that a currency
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.060]   not controlled by governments,
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.560]   it was critical and it was going to be a worldwide currency.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.260]   That's sort of fallen flat.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.180]   The currencies didn't really take over from fiat money.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.280]   So you get rid of that.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.180]   Again, there's nothing sexy about what's being,
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.460]   the functionality implemented by these crypto tools.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.440]   It's really just the political reality
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.620]   that no one controls it.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.700]   And I again, don't think enough people care about that
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.020]   for this to be a complete game changer.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.780]   Could be wrong about this.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.500]   And Jason Horowitz would probably say
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.820]   that Firm would not be happy with my interpretation,
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.660]   but there you go.
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.760]   All right, social media.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.060]   That's the other thing that seems to be really
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.500]   the focus of a lot of techno criticism
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.860]   and conversation right now.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.620]   Longtime listeners know that I believe
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.340]   that social media as we know it,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.500]   that is this age of a small number
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.540]   of massive platform monopolies
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.300]   that everyone is culturally pressured into using.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.400]   We are in the twilight of that moment.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.820]   That moment is passing.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.660]   This is the standard oil,
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.620]   Pennsylvania Central Railroad robber baron era
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.180]   of the social internet era.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.180]   And I think it is passing.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.060]   I've talked about this before,
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.620]   so I won't go into too much detail,
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.720]   but basically at the core of my thought is,
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.700]   one of the things that used to capture people
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.260]   in the social media was network effects.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.220]   People were using social media platforms
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.920]   to connect to people they know.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.820]   Therefore, for a platform to be useful,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   it has to include among its members,
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.500]   all the people that you know or might wanna connect to.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.100]   That is a huge advantage once you get there first,
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.740]   because another social media platform
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.460]   will have a hard time competing,
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.260]   because until they can get your cousin and your aunt
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.380]   and your six friends from high school onto their service,
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.340]   it will be lesser than an existing service like Facebook.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.940]   This is called network effects.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.580]   There's a sort of trivial mathematical law here
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.780]   that says in a network,
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.260]   it's the value grows with the square of the number of users,
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.500]   because now you have a potential connection
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.900]   between every person in it.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.960]   Forget that math.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:18.580]   In general, this was a big justification
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.180]   for why you could not unseat,
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.980]   you could not unseat existing platform monopolies.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.060]   Then they got out of the connection business.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.840]   They thought there was more money in offering distraction,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.100]   because people spend more time distracting themselves
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.220]   than they wanna spend talking to their aunt or their cousin
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.460]   or their six friends from high school.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.140]   And so Facebook and Instagram and Twitter,
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.540]   in particular Twitter and Facebook,
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.860]   moved away from what's your friends up to.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   And towards, here's an algorithmically generated feed
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.380]   of content curated to press some buttons in your brain
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.980]   and keep you looking at your phone.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   You need a moment to get lost or distracted.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.700]   Life is hard, you're stressed, you're anxious, you're bored.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.740]   We will give you something
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.120]   that'll be palliative in the moment.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.740]   They went towards that model,
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.900]   which did get their existing users using the phones more,
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.580]   looking at these apps more,
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.460]   but it has destabilized
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.260]   the originally motivating network effect,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.420]   which is the people you know are on here.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   Once it is no longer giving you that advantage,
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.860]   social media is now competing
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.880]   with any other form of distraction.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.300]   And there's a lot of them, and they're good.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.860]   And now suddenly it's not so critical
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.540]   that my distraction is coming from Facebook
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.700]   versus coming from Spotify,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.420]   versus coming from TikTok
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.940]   or coming from some sort of bespoke, small niche network.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.280]   You're competing with any source of distraction.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.420]   There's no reason to have a massive $500 billion monopoly
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.120]   in this type of context.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.300]   I can be just as diverting with my podcast
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:00.300]   that is produced with a slightly smaller budget
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.900]   than $500 billion a year.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.420]   With even just half that money,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.540]   I could produce deep questions.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.500]   All right, so I think that's what's happening
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.320]   with social media.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.140]   I think TikTok is actually the harbinger of this transition.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.820]   Yes, it's true that TikTok is widely, widely used.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.460]   It has a lot of active users,
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.340]   but TikTok is different than Twitter.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.860]   TikTok is different than Facebook from five years ago.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.700]   Why?
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.220]   It's popular, but it's just pure distraction.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.940]   They don't pretend like it's anything else.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.780]   And because of that,
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.660]   it no longer has the situation of cultural valency
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.120]   where it feels like you have to use it.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.420]   Lots of people use Facebook.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.220]   No one thinks, I mean, TikTok,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.460]   no one thinks it's weird if you don't.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.260]   A lot of people like TikTok.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.260]   No one says you're missing out on business opportunities
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.940]   or knowing what's going on in the world if you don't use it.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.360]   And so from TikTok, we'll get multiple other,
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.620]   I think, increasingly niche, increasingly focused,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.780]   increasingly much smaller and independent types of apps
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.700]   and sources of distraction that leverage
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.220]   social connections and groups, et cetera.
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.780]   And it'll be a fragmented marketplace
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.180]   in which there's no monopoly powers.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.140]   And that's gonna be, I think,
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.620]   a much healthier social internet.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.260]   So social media is a focused lot of conversation.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.140]   I think it's moment has passed.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.020]   The final one I mentioned was AI.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.820]   I don't know what to think about AI.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.320]   I haven't got my arms around AI yet.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.580]   I've been trying to.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.600]   I mean, I understand a lot of the underlying technologies,
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.480]   but in terms of its cultural impact,
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.880]   I don't know where I fall.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.200]   I don't have, for example,
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   a natural fear of AI, general intelligence,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.620]   sentience in AI and what that might cause.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.520]   I just don't have that instinctual fear.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.760]   Is that something that's even on a development pipeline
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   that we need to worry about?
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.320]   I don't know either way.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.800]   AI's role in disrupting industries,
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   it's gonna be disruptive.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.280]   It's complicated how, I think it's hard to predict.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.920]   So AI, keep your eye on it,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.280]   but I don't have a good sense.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.120]   Let me tell you two things
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.600]   that I think are being overlooked
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.680]   that are gonna be super disruptive,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.720]   but I think are being overlooked
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.400]   in a lot of conversations today about technological trends.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.000]   The first is augmented reality.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.400]   This came out of some reporting I've done for The New Yorker.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.080]   I don't think people realize the economic disruption
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.760]   that is going to come from what I call
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.920]   the augmented reality singularity.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.480]   This is gonna be the point where multiple technologies
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.920]   that exist today advance sufficiently
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.960]   to allow the following
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.320]   with a relatively unobtrusive piece of headgear,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.720]   so some sort of pair of glasses
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.480]   that is socially appropriate to wear, comfortable.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.520]   It's not like Google Glass
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   where you walk around with a Google Glass on,
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.440]   and Google tried this experiment.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.480]   They said, "Try walking around with Google Glasses on,"
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.320]   and people's instinct when they saw you with on it was,
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.880]   "I think I need to punch you."
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.640]   Like, when we get past that, with Google Glass,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.200]   people were walking around with Google Glasses,
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.400]   and I'm not exaggerating here,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.440]   nuns would walk out of the convent,
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.200]   say, "Forgive me, Father,"
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.640]   and then just punch you in the face
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.240]   because it was so annoying looking.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.840]   That's what AR.1, version one looks like.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.920]   That will get better.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.440]   So when we get past that stage
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.640]   where AR devices make people wanna punch you,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.960]   where you look so weird and pretentious wearing them,
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.480]   when we get past that stage,
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.840]   when nuns no longer walk out of their convents to punch you,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.000]   and then two,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.680]   two, we get sufficient power and field of view
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.640]   in these glasses that you can replicate
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.000]   with sufficient resolution,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.320]   basically any type of screen,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.880]   digital screen interface we use today,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.360]   and three, we have sort of sufficient internet backbone
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.360]   that we can essentially stream screen surfaces
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.960]   without actually having to do the computation locally.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.460]   And so what I mean by that is,
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.760]   if I want to play a video game,
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.520]   there's sufficient wireless internet backbone
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.880]   that that video game can run in a server somewhere,
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.200]   and the thing that's being streamed to my AR device
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   is just what's on the screen.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.400]   So there's this key point,
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.680]   there's this key speed point where a high res,
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.260]   the contents of a high resolution screen
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.600]   can be streamed over the internet to a device
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.520]   in which you no longer need
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.040]   to actually bring computation with you,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.280]   just enough computation to get the screen of computation
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.200]   happening in the cloud.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.100]   When those three things come together,
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.760]   again, to summarize,
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.240]   hardware that is unobtrusive and people are willing to wear,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.280]   sufficient field of view and resolution
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.400]   that you can replicate most of the standard digital screens
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.520]   you look at in your day-to-day life,
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.840]   and three, sufficient internet wireless backbone,
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.440]   which by the way, we might already have,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.920]   that you can stream high resolution screens to devices
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.400]   so we can now virtualize actual computation.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.360]   It will be the end of consumer electronic,
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.400]   of the consumer electronic industry as we know it.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.280]   Samsung, Apple, Sony,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.220]   the companies that produce complicated electronics
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.760]   that they sell to people,
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.420]   and those people buy these devices and use them.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:19.060]   Those companies will essentially have to go out of business
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.320]   or massively retool,
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.760]   because why would I buy a phone
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.240]   when my AR headset can put in front of me,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.740]   in the space in front of me,
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.600]   the interface for whatever phone I want?
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.040]   Why would I buy a computer
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.480]   when I can make a computer monitor anywhere?
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   Doesn't exist in the real world,
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.120]   it's being projected in my AR goggles,
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.400]   but I can make a nice monitor wherever I wanna go,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.880]   and all the computation is happening in the cloud somewhere.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.080]   So I have the most powerful computer computing,
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.880]   much more powerful than I can actually buy,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.680]   and I can just see the screen right there.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   Why would I buy a TV
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.240]   when I could just stretch a 72 inch on my wall?
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.200]   It's all virtual,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.360]   and everyone who's in that same room
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.520]   sees it in the same place.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.960]   We literally cannot tell the difference
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.360]   between that and an actual TV.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.800]   Why would I buy a TV,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.580]   ship it to me, bring it into my house?
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.900]   I could just have that right up there on my wall.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.440]   The end of the consumer electronics industry as we know it,
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.640]   it's gonna create some of the most powerful companies
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.760]   in the history of the world,
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.440]   it's gonna make Apple seem like a lemonade stand.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.720]   If you are the company that owns
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   the first mainstream, widely adopted,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.600]   full function AR singularity goggles,
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.800]   with that backend doing all the computation,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.560]   all of these companies like Sony, Samsung,
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.600]   will become essentially software companies.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.560]   You're basically just running processes in the cloud
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.320]   that can then stream visuals to individuals.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.680]   It's hard to underestimate how disruptive that's gonna be.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.840]   I don't think we talk enough about it.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.360]   I think it was perhaps a blind spot of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.040]   to focus too much on virtual reality
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.640]   instead of augmented reality.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.840]   Google has invested many, many billions of dollars into this.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.700]   Apple is investing many, many billions of dollars into this.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.380]   Amazon is investing many, many billions of dollars into this.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.400]   Less about the hardware
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.760]   and more about being the backend cloud computation
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.920]   to virtualize all this hardware.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.080]   It is gonna be huge,
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.480]   and I don't think we talk about it enough,
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.760]   we get too distracted.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.300]   The other technological trend I think that's gonna be big
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   is the continued decentralization of media production.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.920]   This is the story of the internet,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   but I think it's just starting to get pretty interesting
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.080]   in recent years.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.520]   So you get HTML in the 1990s,
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.320]   you get websites and then eventually web 2.0.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.080]   So it's websites that are easy for people
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.860]   to update regularly like blogs.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.320]   That had a big impact on decentralizing the ability
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.640]   to produce and sell text.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.880]   We take it for granted now,
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.900]   but remember in 1996,
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.320]   text came from magazines and newspapers.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.440]   You had to have giant warehouses with these big machines
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   with ink and newspaper rolls moving really fast
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.700]   and fleets of trucks.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.160]   And all the advertising dollars would come there,
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.360]   they had a ton of money.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.840]   There's a lot of money in newspaper syndicates,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.240]   a lot of money in magazine syndicates.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.400]   That's where text was, available text.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.240]   The internet changed that.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.520]   Think about how many websites people go to now
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.780]   for information.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.800]   How many independent little media companies,
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.740]   five person, six person shops.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.280]   Ain't it cool news?
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.680]   Let's go back to those early days.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.520]   These type of sites are blogs.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.480]   Ezra Klein came out of blogging
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.720]   before moving over to the Post
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.880]   and over to New York Times.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.880]   Nate Silver, just all of this text, Politico.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.960]   I mean, Politico eventually printed a hardcover version,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.040]   a newspaper version for a while of their thing.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.980]   But there was so much innovation that happened
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.740]   in text media because of HTML.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.140]   Now we're seeing this with audio, podcast.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.300]   Incredibly disruptive.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.580]   This industry is exploding
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.300]   because people like real time analog content.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.620]   We can actually hear someone's voice.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.900]   Radio is a pretty big industry.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.900]   Podcasts will surpass radio soon.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.360]   It will surpass it soon.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.920]   Because again, you open up the ability
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.380]   to create audio to most people.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.340]   The big change happening now is video.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.780]   Video, the ability to produce video
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.280]   whose quality crosses that uncanny valley
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.900]   and is at least comparable to stuff
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.540]   that we maybe saw on cable.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.420]   That's where we're getting now.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.900]   Where more and more people at a fraction of the cost
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.980]   can produce video at a quality that you would say,
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.580]   I could have seen this 10 years ago on Bravo.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.420]   And now you've decentralized video,
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.300]   which was the most powerful media forms of all, right?
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:39.300]   Television and movies is a huge dominant source of media
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.480]   and that is being decentralized now as well.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.260]   These trends I think are critical.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.940]   I think the shift from audio as the stepping stone
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.180]   in the video is gonna be much bigger
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.060]   than even the decentralization of text
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.220]   that happened with the early HTML based web.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.580]   All of this I think is really excited.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.400]   I don't know where it's going,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.020]   but I think it's really exciting.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.620]   The main critique people give,
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.900]   and I think this is so short sighted,
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.300]   is every time one of these media technologies
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.500]   is decentralized, there's always this pushback
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:11.360]   that emerges where people set up this straw man
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.920]   of everyone now will be able to make a living
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.180]   off of this new decentralized media.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.620]   And then when they don't, and most stuff is bad,
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.460]   they say the revolution is a failure.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.860]   Oh, so blogs arise.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.240]   People looked around and said, well, most blogs are bad.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.440]   This idea that everyone's gonna make a living
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.020]   off a blog isn't true.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.620]   But that was never the point.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.620]   Yeah, most people are bad at producing stuff.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.100]   Most people are not meant to be media figures.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.780]   Most people don't have the insight or the training
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.080]   to produce really interesting audio or words or video.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.740]   The point is when you open it up to everyone,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.980]   you get this extreme Darwinian competition.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.060]   And what is the point of Darwinian competition?
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.520]   Not that all the different types of proverbial species
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.020]   are gonna survive, but that it's going to drive innovation
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.860]   into new species, new configurations
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.620]   that wouldn't have existed before.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.840]   That is what is important about decentralization.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.700]   There's 850,000 active podcasts right now.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.680]   Most of them do not do very well,
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.560]   but that is a huge amount of selective pressure.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.460]   There's gonna produce a couple thousand
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.480]   that do really well and are really innovative
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.520]   and will change the media landscape altogether.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.960]   Most of YouTube is dreck,
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.280]   but there's millions and millions of hours of footage
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.480]   being uploaded every minute.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.240]   That is a huge amount of selective pressure.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.760]   It's gonna change and evolve and mutate
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.120]   the visual media landscape.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.720]   So I don't know where all this decentralization is going.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.100]   I just think it's important.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.240]   That's why I'm doing audio.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.120]   This is why Jesse and I were quick to get video
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.480]   going on the show as well.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.100]   We think all of this is very important,
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.600]   even if we can't tell where it's going.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.140]   All right, Miranda, that was a long answer.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.240]   That was a long answer to a short question,
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.340]   but I'm glad you asked it.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.120]   So really quick summary.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   Crypto I think is overhyped.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.520]   We're in the twilight of the massive
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.960]   social media monopoly era.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.880]   AI, I don't know, keep an eye on it.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.720]   I don't want to tell you about it.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.520]   Two biggest trends that are being missed.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.760]   AR for sure.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   I think people don't understand the impact.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.360]   Decentralized media, people know it's gonna be big,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.700]   but maybe they don't realize how disruptive it's gonna be.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.360]   I think the audio video,
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.120]   internet audio video revolution in particular
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.340]   is gonna be the biggest change to media since television.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.020]   All right, that's technology.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.000]   Do a couple of quick ads,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.540]   and then we'll do a couple of deep life questions,
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.880]   and then we will wrap things up.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.920]   Let's talk about another longtime sponsor of this show,
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.220]   and that is Grammarly.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:38.360]   We are busy now, and we're working from home.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.000]   We're on Zoom all the time.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.840]   We're involved in more products and initiatives
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.080]   than we ever have been before.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   This is not when you wanna have unclear communication.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.800]   You want your emails, your Slack chats,
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.960]   your text messages,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.880]   your reports that you're sending the clients.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.520]   You need that writing to be professional
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.360]   and effective.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.440]   If you can write concise, professional, effective writing,
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.400]   it is a huge competitive advantage.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:10.440]   This is where Grammarly enters the scene.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.160]   Grammarly is a free to download desktop app
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.160]   that works wherever you do your writing on your computer.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.240]   It has features that blow my mind.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.320]   I am used to the old grammar checkers
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.480]   from the word perfect days in the early 90s.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.720]   Compare that to what Grammarly can do today.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.600]   It is night and day.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.320]   So let's say you're writing a pitch.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.560]   Grammarly has a tone detector
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.200]   that can make sure that the tone you're giving
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.480]   is just right.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.720]   Tone detector can look at your writing
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.640]   and tell you about your tone.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.860]   It can help you in the premium version of the product,
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.920]   rewrite your synthesis to be more clear.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.520]   So the premium version of Grammarly can say,
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.800]   look, here's a different way to write that same sentence.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.560]   It's gonna be more clear to the reader.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.760]   Clarity impresses.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.920]   It even will help you do tone transformations.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.360]   So again, this is why Grammarly premium
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.640]   has this feature as well.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.200]   Why don't you rewrite it this way?
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.560]   And the tone will be more colloquial.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.760]   These are powerful, cool tools.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.900]   It's like having a professional editor
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:15.920]   looking over your shoulder,
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:20.380]   helping your writing be clear, professional and effective.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.000]   So get to the point faster and accomplish more
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.760]   using Grammarly.

[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.800]   So to get that 20% off,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.320]   you have to sign up at grammarly.com/deep.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   That's G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/deep.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:52.500]   I also wanna talk about my body tutor.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.440]   I've known Adam Gilbert,
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.300]   the founder of My Body Tutor for many years.
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.820]   He used to be the fitness advice guy
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.940]   back on my old study hacks blog.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.220]   His company, My Body Tutor,
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.500]   is a 100% online coaching program
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.940]   that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:12.240]   which is lack of consistency.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.100]   It does this by simplifying the process
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.200]   into practical sustainable behaviors.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.580]   Do this exercise at this time,
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.500]   eat this food, not those foods.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.820]   And then, and here is the secret sauce to My Body Tutor,
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.340]   giving you daily accountability
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.420]   with a dedicated online coach
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   who you will get to know and appreciate,
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:34.580]   and will get to know you to help you stick with your plan.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.980]   That is the key.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.060]   Here is my coach, I talk to him every day.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.140]   Sustainability, consistency,
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.060]   that's what makes these programs work.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.540]   Adam and his coaches at My Body Tutor
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.380]   are the best in the world
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:51.360]   at delivering highly personal accountability and coaching.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.220]   And because Adam has known me for so long,
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.500]   if you're serious about getting fit
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.900]   and you wanna sign up for My Body Tutor,
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.420]   mention that you heard about them from Deep Questions
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.660]   when you sign up and you will get $50 off your first month.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.220]   Just mention you came from Deep Questions,
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:11.220]   they will give you that $50 right off your first month's cost.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.160]   You wanna get in shape, summer, wanna look good,
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   wanna get healthier, want more energy, mybodytutor.com.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.620]   All right, woo, look at this.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.560]   I was trying to knock out a quick episode,
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.020]   my diseased adult body here by myself,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.700]   but I'm already over an hour, I can't help it, I get bored.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.900]   Must've missed everyone.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.620]   I'll move quick, I got a few deep life questions,
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.720]   let's move quick, but let's get them done.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:46.040]   The first deep life question comes from Kim.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.900]   Kim says, "Does your focus on the quantity of books
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.540]   "that you read dilute their impact?
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.340]   "Can you remember the content of that many books
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.420]   "or does it even matter?"
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.580]   Kim, I don't think I read that many books.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.780]   I read five books a month, I don't think that's that many.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.180]   I think in June, I'm gonna read six
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.180]   because I had a couple of days where I was being COVID-y,
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.020]   so I took advantage of that to read an extra book.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.100]   I don't think that's a lot of books,
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.260]   I think our standards are too low.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.360]   I think our standards for intellectual engagement
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.680]   have got so low that that seems like
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.120]   some impossibly large amount,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.500]   but I think historically speaking,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.840]   or looking at the life of any sort of serious intellectual,
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.000]   especially pre-internet intellectual,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.600]   five books a month is nothing.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.480]   That's nothing.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.720]   And so no, I don't think I read too much
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.880]   to dilute their impact.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.900]   Again, here's the thing, I don't skim,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.680]   I'm not staying up late in the night
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.460]   to try to make some numbers.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.640]   You have more time than you think to do things like reading
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.020]   if you get rid of other things that are taking its place,
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.800]   namely looking at your phone.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.320]   Just leisurely reading in your spare time
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.080]   can generate more books completed than you would imagine.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.460]   So I actually uploaded a video a couple of weeks ago.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.740]   I recorded it just for YouTube,
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.000]   it was just an inspiration I had.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   So you can only find it at the
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.480]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.840]   but it was called something like
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.580]   how I read five books a month.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.440]   And so Kim, you might wanna watch that.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.040]   And I get into what I do in my life
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.960]   to get through that many books.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.760]   If you watch that video, you'll see
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.780]   not that much reading.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.180]   All right, Thomas.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.000]   Thomas says, "As I become more efficient
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.700]   and ambitious with my time,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.680]   I find it is psychologically harder
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.520]   for me to take vacation and disengage.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.880]   I think extended breaks are valuable,
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.520]   but as my mind workflows and priorities
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.880]   become more fine-tuned,
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.900]   it feels harder to turn them off for a few days.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   I feel like productivity is a high inertia machine
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.120]   that isn't easily slowed down."
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.560]   Thomas, you are right.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.760]   Welcome to the club.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.920]   If you really get going,
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.080]   you're in a cognitively demanding field,
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.340]   you're structured in your time,
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.320]   you're focused diligently on
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.080]   ambitious intellectual goals.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.840]   We come back to something again and again.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.960]   You're seeing results, it's exciting, it's interesting.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.400]   You're podcasting, you're writing,
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.360]   you're solving proofs, you're whatever you're doing.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.960]   Yeah, it is a high inertia machine
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.400]   that you cannot just turn off.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.100]   I learned that lesson the hard way,
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.880]   trying to go on vacation for a week and say,
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.320]   "I'm not gonna do any work."
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.000]   And you get to day three,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.840]   and I have delirium tremors,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.720]   like a recovering alcohol addict,
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.200]   like shaking and frustrated and upset,
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.320]   and scratching math equations in the size of palm trees.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.580]   So I learned early on,
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:37.520]   you can't really shut that machine down very easily.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.520]   So if you're going on a trip,
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   bring something to do.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.640]   It shouldn't be something that is going to be high stakes.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.760]   It shouldn't be something that involves you
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.640]   having to do work communication or email,
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.760]   but bring some sort of project.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.760]   I would often bring, especially pre-tenure,
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.080]   a math problem I'm trying to solve.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.840]   Or I would say,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.600]   "I think I wanna write a paper on this topic.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.000]   "Let me really start thinking through a little bit each day.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.600]   "Let me walk the beach,
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.640]   "walk through town and think and take notes.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.760]   "At least have one session every day
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.400]   "where I'm working on some sort of long-term,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.800]   "non-urgent, but intellectually demanding project."
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.040]   You just have to do it.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.760]   Once you get up that intellectual motor turning
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.720]   and cranking, it doesn't stop.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.120]   So give yourself stuff to do
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.920]   that's going to be minimally distracting.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.360]   I can actually connect various intellectual output
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.720]   to various trips.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.800]   Like I know exactly the beach.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.920]   Where was it? In the Bahamas.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.000]   And I forgot the name of the island.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.160]   But I can picture the beach so clearly
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.800]   on which I figured out the whole structure
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.640]   for digital minimalism and made the decision of,
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.240]   "Wait a second, I need to write this book."
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.680]   There's just an arbitrary, I remember the paper.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   It's not a very interesting paper,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.680]   but I remember the beach in Lewis, Delaware,
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.840]   where I solved the main results for a particular paper.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.080]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.280]   Stuff gets done on trips.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.160]   I think that's fine.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   The only thing I'll say, Thomas,
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.760]   is also have good schedule shutdown rituals.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.120]   If you have a high inertia mind, you need them.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.360]   Otherwise your mind will spiral off
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.280]   into work-related thoughts at night,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.960]   and you'll never be able to enjoy anything,
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.360]   and you're going to have a hard time sleeping.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.720]   So you have to be able to shut down
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.680]   sort of back and forth communication
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.880]   and decision-making about work.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.680]   You really got to trust those schedule shutdown
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.360]   complete rituals, but don't expect you can go five,
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.320]   six days without doing any work.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.960]   Once your mind gets going, you got to feed it.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.160]   All right, let's do one more question here.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.960]   This one comes from Joe.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.600]   Joe says, "How do I get over discouragement
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.280]   from inconsistency on progress for developing a vision,
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.400]   having a quarterly plan, spending time on weekly planning
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.280]   and daily time block planning with my shutdown ritual?
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.200]   How do I get back on the horse after I fall off my attempts
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.640]   to put this process in the place?
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.200]   I used to enjoy your podcast so much.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.600]   Now I've got a sense of discomfort in listening to the podcast
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.280]   and realizing how little progress I've made
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.800]   on the whole process.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.960]   Joe, you might be trying to bite off more
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.720]   than you can chew all at once.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.080]   There's a lot of ideas I talk about on the show.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.920]   It might be tempting to put them all into place at first.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.560]   You talk about all these different multi-scale
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.520]   planning things where you have your vision
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.160]   and your quarterly plan, your weekly plan,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.960]   your daily plans with shutdown complete.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.560]   We talk about deep life stuff.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.640]   We talk about reading.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.120]   We talk about training your mind.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.360]   We talk about, there's so much we talk about.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.720]   And it's all appealing to you,
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.760]   which is good.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.440]   That means you're aiming down the right path,
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.440]   but you're trying to take too big of a leap all at once.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.800]   So one thing I might recommend is,
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.880]   let's go through the deep work bucket overhaul exercise
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.400]   first as a way of just grounding your life,
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.480]   rewriting your self narrative as someone
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.200]   who can take changes towards things that matter,
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.040]   and then worry about making bigger changes.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.160]   So as you know, the deep life overhaul strategy says,
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.760]   you break down your life into the buckets,
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.480]   the areas that are most important to you.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.360]   Let's say craft, constitution, community,
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.040]   contemplation, et cetera.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.160]   And then for each of those,
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.320]   you put a keystone habit in the place,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.960]   something that is not trivial,
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.720]   but not super, super hard.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.080]   Something that you can probably do every day
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.000]   that signals to yourself,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.760]   you take each of these areas of your life seriously
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.000]   and are willing to do non-necessary,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.320]   non-mandatory action to make progress on
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   or support these different areas
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.280]   that are important to you.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.600]   And you track that every day.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.440]   That's what you're tracking.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.240]   Keystone habits, four or five buckets.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.120]   Just do that for a while.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.920]   That might be harder than you think.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.840]   You might have false starts.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.440]   This keystone habit wasn't really consistent.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.160]   This was too ambitious.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.360]   You might spend months until you get to that collection
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.960]   of keystone habits and buckets that you feel good about.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.520]   Once you're consistently hitting those habits,
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.040]   then you take one bucket at a time,
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.000]   give it four to six weeks,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.720]   and do some sort of significant overhaul
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   of that part of your life.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.280]   Then and only then is where I would do something
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.400]   like introducing multiscale planning in your case.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.160]   So maybe when you're doing the craft overhaul,
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.720]   you're rethinking your work,
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.840]   you're taking projects off your plate that aren't important.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.720]   You're focusing on a smaller number of initiatives
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.240]   you think are important.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   You bring in something like multiscale planning.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.080]   Like when it's part of this bigger, more gradual,
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.000]   more structured overhaul of your life,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.080]   I think you are able to more consistently make progress
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.600]   and not have everything fall apart
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.000]   when one thing doesn't work.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.320]   So Joe, you're aimed in the right direction.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.160]   I think you have the right ambitions.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.720]   What you're missing is I would say
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.840]   a more sustainable process towards depth.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.480]   So do the buckets, do the keystones,
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.400]   keep working on the keystones till you have them,
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.000]   then do a round of overhaul.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.240]   Enjoy that life for six months,
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.960]   do another round of overhaul, repeat.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.720]   You will gradually bit by bit get deeper and deeper.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.640]   The hardest part is deciding that's what you wanna do.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.840]   Everything else is just execution.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.480]   So congratulations, you've already done the hard part.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.160]   Now get after it.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.680]   All right, that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.000]   Thank you for listening.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:09.880]   If you like what you heard,

[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.320]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
