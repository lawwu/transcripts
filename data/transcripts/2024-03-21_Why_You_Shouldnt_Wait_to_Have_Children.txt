[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.520]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   I'm your host.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.680]   And on today's podcast, I want to discuss with you the question, should you wait to
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.440]   have children until you can afford it?
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.760]   Now, in the most recent podcast episode, I dealt with the question of, should you wait
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.960]   to get married until you can afford it?
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.520]   And I wasn't originally planning to do this follow-along episode immediately, but after
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.040]   further consideration, I realized, obviously, it makes sense.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.480]   As the old children's nursery rhyme goes, first comes love, then comes marriage, then
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.820]   comes a baby in a baby carriage.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.980]   And while that sequence of events may not be as consistent as we might like, it still
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.420]   generally is true, and so it makes sense to talk about these things together.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.380]   In this podcast episode, I'm going to share with you some ideas that come not only from
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.700]   personal experience, after all, my wife and I have five children ages 10 and under, but
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.660]   more importantly, from a significant amount of experience that I have gained from working
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.020]   as a financial planner for many, many families, and I want to share with you some stories
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.020]   that I think will drive some of these points home to you.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.760]   The basic thesis of what I want to share with you is that, yes, some appropriate amount
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.420]   of financial planning is warranted when it comes to making decisions regarding having
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.420]   children.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.980]   However, it's probably not so significant as you might think, and if you'll sit down
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.100]   and lay out the specific concerns that you have, you may find that if you want to have
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.980]   children, and if you're able to have children, you don't need quite so much money as you
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.540]   otherwise thought that you did.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.980]   To begin, let's build a foundation by talking about goal setting.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.980]   When I help people with goal setting, I often divide goals into what I call time-bound goals
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860]   and money-bound goals.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.220]   A time-bound goal is something that either can only happen at a certain stage of life
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.060]   or is something that is really best if done at a certain stage of life.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.900]   A money-bound goal, on the other hand, is something that you need a specific amount
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.320]   of money to accomplish, and it can be done at any point in time when you acquire the
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   money.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.460]   So, there's no perfect line between these, but there are many goals that will naturally
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.420]   fall into one or another.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.220]   So, for example, you might have a goal of finishing high school or finishing college.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.140]   Generally speaking, you don't need money in order to finish high school or really even
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.140]   college.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.140]   Generally, what you need is time, and life really works well if you finish high school
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.900]   on the normal schedule.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.020]   Obviously, if you didn't finish high school on the normal schedule and you find yourself
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.660]   at 50 years old and you're in need of a high school diploma, you can go and get that, and
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.060]   you can go back to college at any point in time.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.300]   But there's real value in doing these things in the normal expected time period.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.700]   There are other things that would play into this.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.860]   Recently I had a consultation with an orthodontist.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.020]   I wanted to talk about straightening my teeth.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.700]   I had braces when I was young, but foolishly I didn't wear my retainer, and now my teeth
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.300]   have gotten all crowded and crooked, and so I was looking into getting braces.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.780]   And I was just thinking about how silly it is that here I am at my age having to go back
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.660]   and think about getting braces to straighten out teeth that should have been kept straight.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.020]   The best time to get braces is, if needed, when you're young, and then keep your teeth
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.980]   in good shape.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.580]   And it's not so much a money goal, it would have been better to get that done at a certain
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.300]   time and keep them at that point.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.780]   Now financial goals often are related to things like consumption items.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.100]   I want to have a certain kind of car, or I want to buy a motorcycle, or I want to buy
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.780]   a horse, and I'm going to do it as soon as I'm able to save the money, or I want to retire.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.340]   Even big goals.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.180]   Children, in my opinion, should always be considered primarily as a time-bound goal.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.220]   Because there are two things that are true about having children.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.580]   One, there's a time in life in which it's easier to have children, and everything related
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.740]   to children is probably better when you do it sooner rather than later.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.100]   Not entirely, but better.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.260]   Physically, if you desire to have children, that needs to happen at a certain point in
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.260]   life.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.700]   Men and women are not able to have babies at just any point in time biologically.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.940]   There's a rather narrow window of time, something on the order of 15 to 20 years, in which women
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.960]   are able to conceive and birth healthy babies.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.480]   With modern reproductive technologies and modern medical care, we have been able to
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.980]   extend that window.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.460]   But when you extend that window, you get very unreliable results, and you get significant
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.000]   amounts of expense, often, that are associated with it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.500]   And even if you can technically birth a baby outside of that normal 10-year to 15-year
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.660]   window when it's relatively easy and straightforward for most women, you still have to deal with
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.260]   the challenges of raising a child at an older point in time.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:10.260]   Now, I believe that children should always be welcomed and always be cared for and supported,
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.580]   regardless of whether they are convenient in our lives or not.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.860]   Children are a blessing, that's a universal statement of fact, and they are always to
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.820]   be welcomed and cared for.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.420]   And sometimes, though we might like to think ourselves emperors of our lives and our domains,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.500]   in reality, we're not quite so much in charge of the world as we might like to believe that
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.980]   we are.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.960]   And children are precious.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.460]   We should care for them, no matter when they come along.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.220]   I've worked with a handful of families, for example, who had children young, had their
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.860]   perfect plan worked out, moved on through their lives, had launched their children,
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.660]   they were done, ready to retire, and all of a sudden, they found themselves caring for
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.660]   a grandchildren.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.980]   Either the death of a child or a child was unable to take care of his or her own children,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.780]   and now they're starting over again, raising children.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.820]   And I think that's an admirable and respectable thing that we do.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.420]   Sometimes, people find themselves with children much earlier than was planned.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.320]   In that situation, you care for the child, take care of the child, do your best, and
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.420]   learn in the situation.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.220]   So we should have that as a foundation.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.420]   But backing away from any kind of extreme examples, I think it's important that we acknowledge
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.100]   that most things with children happen better if you have those children when you're relatively
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.140]   young.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.980]   Probably not too young, I'll let you put the number on that, but when you're relatively
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.780]   young, it's easier.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.340]   Physically speaking, again, the act of conception and the act of childbirth are much easier
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.620]   for women who are younger.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.380]   It's easier, you have much statistically higher chances of having a healthy baby, of having
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.620]   smooth pregnancies, faster and easier recovery, everything is easier.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.020]   If you're not involved or have never had babies, one of the things that was most surprising
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:07.180]   to my wife and I is if you are 35 years old and you are a woman, then you have now been
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.980]   graduated into a... and you're pregnant.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.420]   You've now been graduated into something called geriatric pregnancy.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.700]   That's the politically incorrect term, they're trying to change it now to advanced maternal
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   age.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   I don't know that one is better than another.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.860]   But that word geriatric is just so funny that geriatric pregnancy, you're now automatically
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.220]   considered to be a high-risk pregnancy and you have to take special precautions.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:37.260]   So for a woman who conceives and births a baby at or beyond 35 years of age, you have
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.240]   to take many more precautions.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:48.100]   It's remarkable that there are more women now birthing children into their 40s and even
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.140]   beyond successfully.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.180]   I read recently something like a statistic that there are four times more mothers who
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.460]   birth their first child after the age of 40 than ever before, something like that.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.740]   And it's pretty remarkable.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.900]   However, it can be extremely difficult.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.300]   And one of the things that often happens to people, at least in my experience, is they
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.020]   assume, well, when we go to the point of having children, it's all going to be simple.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.460]   The normal flow of life, at least among my peers, tends to be something like this.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.180]   We should have children after we have finished all of our schooling.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.780]   And by schooling, generally most people mean something between 16 and 20 years of schooling.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.780]   So we need to have children after we've finished all of our schooling, after we've established
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.500]   ourselves in our career, and usually what they mean by that is something between five
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.300]   to 15 years of work, often 10, and we want to get married, and then we'll go ahead and
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.660]   have babies.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.420]   And so it's very normal in my circles that a husband and wife would be about 30, 35,
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.500]   they start thinking about, okay, we're going to go ahead and have a baby because we did
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.580]   school until 22, 24, 26.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.300]   Then we had five to 10 years of establishment in our careers to make lots of money, and
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.380]   now we were ready to have a baby.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.660]   Well, often couples find that it's not quite so easy to conceive and have a baby as they
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.180]   thought.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.940]   And if it is possible to do it once, in many cases it's not possible to do it twice or
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.340]   it's not possible to do it thrice.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.540]   And so it's just very challenging for couples because what they thought was going to be
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.060]   smooth and easy often is not.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.420]   And there's a lot of heartache involved with multiple miscarriages, multiple challenges.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.900]   It can be quite difficult.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.320]   So there's no guarantees in life, but just be aware and do a deep study of those.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.260]   Because I think in our modern age, because we're so accustomed to controlling everything
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.780]   medically perfectly, people often have a naive understanding of how easy it's going to be
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.620]   to have babies when they're ready for them.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.900]   And I'm not even discussing the topic of freezing eggs and in vitro fertilization, all the modern
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.660]   reproductive technologies, all of them are much more fraught with difficulty, danger,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.600]   and poor results than most people would like to hear about.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.260]   The second thing though, with regard to children, is that most things about raising children
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.080]   are easier when you are young.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.680]   Younger people tend to have more physical energy than older parents do.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:26.040]   And so it can be much easier for a mom and a dad who are 22 years old to deal with one
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.940]   or two or three little babies than it is for a mom or dad who are 42 years old to deal
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.420]   with one or two or three little babies.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:39.760]   In addition, because of youthful energy, youthful vigor, a lot of just the physical fun of playing
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.260]   with children and doing things with them is much easier.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.180]   And younger parents tend to have an easier time dealing with the physical demands of
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.300]   child raising more so than older parents do.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.540]   In addition, if you have babies when you're younger, you're often more flexible in your
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.180]   thinking and more flexible in your lifestyle.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.740]   Certainly there are bad parents of every age and there are good parents of every age.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.700]   But it can be difficult for older parents to adjust their lifestyle to working with
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   children.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.260]   However, younger parents, in the same way that people who get married when they're younger,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.140]   they're often more flexible, can fit in with another person, younger parents can often
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.620]   fit them into their lifestyle in a better way.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.500]   And I think being a young parent of older children is awesome.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.780]   I have a friend of mine who had four children in his early 20s, he and his wife.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:34.180]   And he's in his early 40s, about 42 years old, his youngest is 15 years old, if I have
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.540]   the math right, and four children, all older, and here he is in the time in life in which
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.300]   some people are just starting to have babies, and his work is done behind him.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.180]   And so when you have babies, there is a very intense period of dealing with young babies
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.620]   where your lifestyle and everything is disrupted, but in time you can kind of get that behind
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.220]   you and it's kind of nice to have it behind you and have the benefits of being with children.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.260]   In addition, if you have children when you're younger, you get to simply enjoy them for
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.340]   a longer period of time.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:09.220]   If you think about the simple number of years that you have with your children, who doesn't
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.300]   want to have more time with them?
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.780]   If you're the kind of person who wants to have children in the first place, one of the
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.140]   reasons you're doing that is probably to have time with them.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.140]   I don't.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.220]   I don't know, maybe women do, but at least for me as a man, I don't look forward to babies
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.220]   and toddlers.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.100]   I look forward to children and mature adults.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.740]   That's where I really enjoy it.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.580]   I do it because you've got to get through the baby and toddler stage, and I'm grateful
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:42.220]   that God has given my wife this weird gene that she looks at her babies and she melts.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.620]   But on the whole though, I look forward to time with mature children.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.180]   That's what's super exciting.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.180]   When you have your children when you're younger, you have more time with them, more time then
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.860]   with your grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.980]   One thing that's fascinating to me is how our expectations of what is normal with regard
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:12.780]   to having children have been dramatically skewed by our society.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.580]   If you are one of my younger listeners, I'm imagining you may be 20 years old.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.420]   One of the things that I have observed is that you probably receive very little encouragement
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.060]   to have children.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:35.180]   I didn't realize this myself until about the specific age doesn't matter.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.100]   But my wife and I have been married for I think five or six years.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:46.580]   We had three children, and we had children in our late 20s.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.760]   We had three children, and I remember we were in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we were visiting
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.980]   the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.260]   All of a sudden, here came a young couple down the street towards us.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260]   It was a beautiful young couple, and they were pushing a baby stroller with a beautiful
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.260]   baby in it.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.980]   I looked at the couple, and due to my advanced age, they just looked like kids to me, absolute
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   kids.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.340]   I looked at them, and I stared, and I thought, "I don't ever see this.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.340]   I don't ever see..."
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.460]   By the way, they weren't kids.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.000]   They were probably 20 years old, 21 years old.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.500]   They just looked young to me, and I realized I never see 19-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 22-year-olds
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.260]   with children ever in our society.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.180]   I see 30-year-olds with children because that's what is societally normal in the culture that
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.400]   I'm from.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.200]   It shocked me on the one hand, but it also...
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.080]   I realized the death and destruction of my own culture.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:59.600]   It should be normal to see healthy, happy, strong 20-year-old married couples with children.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.420]   That should be norm, the norm.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.200]   That's a healthy society.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.760]   The fact that we don't see that as much as we do is an indictment on the dysfunction
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.620]   that we have built.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.320]   What are our counterarguments that undoubtedly some fraction of my listeners are immediately
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   thinking of?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.960]   "We don't want to have babies too young."
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:24.080]   Sure, but you define to me what is too young and why, and then prove to me that having
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.840]   children is specifically the problem.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.000]   I have interacted, and I know personally friends, family members who feel like they had children
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   too young.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.180]   Usually, though, it wasn't the children that were the problem.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:42.080]   It was that they didn't receive good counsel about forming their marital relationships,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   and they weren't helped to develop maturity at a young age.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.720]   Those are some of the issues that we talked about previously.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:58.920]   I had a friend of mine who is a midwife, and she delivered her great-granddaughter when
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.200]   she was close to 60.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.600]   I forget which side of 60 she was on.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.000]   Her mother passed away when she was—I think she was not yet 65, so between 60 and 65,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.800]   and her mother was passing away at 80.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.000]   I talked to her about it, and I realized again at the other end of the spectrum how shocking
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.840]   it is to think about multiple generations.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:26.380]   I did the math, and in her family, my friend, she had had her first baby at 16 years old.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:33.800]   That had been basically part of their family culture, that she had her first baby as a
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.360]   mid-teenager, her daughter had her first baby as a mid-to-late teenager, and then now her
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.320]   granddaughter was having her first baby as a mid-to-late teenager.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.440]   On the one hand, I was a little uncomfortable with that.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:52.680]   I still am, because it doesn't feel like that's the right decision in our current
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.520]   cultural context.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.600]   But I really checked myself, and I thought, "Wait a second.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.160]   Historically speaking, biologically speaking, this really should be a normal event.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:11.760]   It should be normal, for example, for a child to be born to, say, a 20-year-old mother,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.560]   who has a 40-year-old—the child would have a 40-year-old grandmother, a 60-year-old
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.160]   great-grandmother, and an 80-year-old great-great-grandmother."
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   I thought, "What an amazing wealth that would be to have so many generations in life."
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:35.280]   My wife and I, with our own children, our children were able to get to know their great-grandparents
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.880]   before they passed away.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.900]   But it was only for a short time, and it was only because the great-grandparents were quite
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.240]   long-lived, beyond centenarians.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.080]   It should be more normal to be able to get to know and have a very close relationship
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   with great-grandparents.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:19:01.200]   Biologically speaking, it's healthy if children are born to a 20-year-old mother and on beyond.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.080]   And wouldn't that be an amazing generational continuity?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.000]   That's what some of our forebears, who had children earlier, were able to enjoy.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.820]   They were able to enjoy more of an understanding of the generations and the continuity of family.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.800]   And while we've created some unique challenges in the way that we structure our society and
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.520]   the way that we raise children that make that kind of situation very rare, and in many cases
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.000]   probably inadvisable, that's not to say that it wouldn't be amazing if it could happen.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   And I think we should recognize that a child that grows up and barely gets to know his
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.880]   grandparents is much poorer, culturally speaking, societally speaking, than a child who knows
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:53.240]   his 16 great-great-grandparents, because there was a tradition of having children at an earlier
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.720]   age.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.160]   Here's the thesis as we turn to money.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.920]   Don't wait until you can afford it to have children.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.620]   Wait until you're married and you want to have children, and then have children.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.180]   If there's something that you need to wait for, financially speaking, the kind of thing
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.740]   that you need to wait for should probably be a financial goal that you could accomplish
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.740]   within a year.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.680]   If it's longer term than that, if it's a goal that's going to take you 10 years to do, you're
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.180]   waiting until you're financially independent to be able to have children, I don't think
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.180]   that's a wise move.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:40.720]   If you want to have children, again, all of this is predicated upon wanting to have children,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.260]   but if that's the case, then finances should probably not be the determining factor.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.260]   Is money important?
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.260]   Absolutely, it is.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:54.780]   I think any fair-minded advisor will acknowledge that your life will cost more if you have
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.120]   children than if you don't.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   How could it not?
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.340]   Join us today during the Jeep Celebration event, where right now, well-qualified lessees

[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.960]   There's recently been some internet memes around the dinks promoting their lifestyle.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.060]   Dinks are always going to have the most disposable income.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.720]   Dual income, no kids.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.840]   You have the efficiency of lifestyle, the savings of two people, sharing expenses, and
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   no kids.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.680]   Two incomes, you're going to have the most disposable income.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.480]   There's no question about that.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.740]   But if you're the kind of person who wants to have children, then I would encourage you
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.800]   that money probably isn't as important as you might think.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.600]   I'm going to get into the details, but I want to make one more comment because I don't want
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.640]   to hide my, I want to talk about children, and I'm not hiding my agenda.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.000]   I want to encourage fecundity.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.400]   I want to encourage you to have children.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.880]   I don't want to encourage reckless fecundity.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   That's not my goal.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.340]   I don't think that just anyone should have babies or even that everyone should have babies.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.160]   If you don't want to have children, don't have them.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   That's fine.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.000]   I'm not here to impose anything on you.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.240]   I want to push back against some propaganda that is often pushed on us with children,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   that there's a lot of propaganda that says that children are a net harm to your life.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.660]   And I would like to vigorously push back against that propaganda because antinatal propaganda
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.080]   is fundamentally anti-humanist.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.360]   You become an enemy of your species.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:00.120]   The most basic function of a society should be to be able to reproduce itself so that
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.760]   we can see our species flourish.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.080]   And there's so much antinatal propaganda in our society that I do want to push back against
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   that.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.000]   But I don't want to push back against an individual.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.720]   If you've made a choice and you say that children are not for me, hit stop and move on.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.960]   And I will respect you and honor you without reserve.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.200]   Not everyone wants to have children.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.240]   Not everyone should have children.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.520]   Of course many people can't have children.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   That's totally fine.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.360]   So I'm not encouraging any kind of reckless fecundity.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.640]   I also don't think that you should just have as many children as you possibly can.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.640]   I'm not an extremist.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.000]   I don't think that you should recklessly procreate just because you're capable of it and as a
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.480]   guy you should go out and get as many women pregnant for as much time as possible.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.120]   That is not in any way what I am encouraging.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.680]   I'm an advocate of the so-called success sequence.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   Graduate from high school, get a job, get married, stay married and have babies within
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.120]   wedlock.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   We don't need any more bastards in our society and we don't need more single dads and moms.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.940]   But within that context, within those basic parameters, if you want to have children and
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.240]   are able to have children, then I'm trying to release you from the idea that you have
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   to be mega rich to do so.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.720]   I think this concept has held a lot of people back to say that I have to get more money
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.680]   in order to have more children and they often wind up at the end of their lives with plenty
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.800]   of money and fewer children than they want to have.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.120]   In the United States, where I know the statistics best, women regularly self-report not having
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.360]   as many children as they themselves would like to have and I believe that finances are
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.640]   a significant contributing factor as to why that is the case.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.760]   Having babies is a good thing and it's something that we should acknowledge and that we should
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.000]   encourage.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.400]   Young married people, because of our touchiness on this subject, are generally not encouraged
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.280]   to have children.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.600]   Your experience may differ.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.400]   Maybe you have your grandmother who's saying, "When are you going to have babies?"
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.160]   But at least my experience, I don't pressure people to have children.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.640]   If people aren't having children, I generally don't even ask.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.400]   If I do ask, the most I say is just, "Do you hope to have children?"
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.500]   To me, that's the lightest way I can broach a subject that is often just a normal part
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.840]   of interaction with people that you care about without pressuring somebody.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.640]   But I don't know what reasons somebody may have for choosing not to have children.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.200]   I don't know what medical reasons someone may have for not having children, so I don't
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.000]   go and pry in people's lives.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   But we need to talk in public about how wonderful babies are.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.120]   They're good things.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:39.060]   Babies are likely to bring enormous amounts of joy and satisfaction into your life personally.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:45.740]   Most parents find exceptions, certainly they're out there, but most parents cite their children
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.540]   and subsequent generations of grandchildren, great-grandchildren, as a primary source
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.380]   of joy, satisfaction, and accomplishment in their life.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.140]   And it has always been this way, and as far as I can see, it always will be.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.500]   And the exceptions prove the rule more than they make us think that this should fundamentally
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   change.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.260]   One thing I particularly like about having children is I think they bring a wonderful
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.880]   phase effect to life.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.300]   That's my name for it.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:19.020]   But the idea being that a life that only has one or two chapters—a book that only has
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.100]   one or two chapters is kind of a boring book.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   A book that has many chapters and each chapter has a different theme is much more interesting.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.960]   I've counseled a lot of—I've done financial planning for a lot of wealthy people who had
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:40.980]   lots of money, early retirees, and one of the things I've noticed is that they have
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.460]   to work very hard to imagine different phases of life.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:52.700]   And one of the things that happens is because aging is a continual, never-ending process,
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:59.280]   it's hard to look forward to aging if you don't have some counter—not counterfactual,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.720]   but like countervailing goal to appreciate.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.760]   If you—let's say that you're dual income, no kids, and let's say that you hit the magic
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.160]   goal of being 30 years old and you are at the top of your game, you're financially independent,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.340]   you've made a ton of money, and now you're retired and you're 30 years old and you have
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.320]   all the money in the world to do anything that you want.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.720]   Looking forward over your life, you've got, say, let's call it 50 to 70 years of life
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   to fill.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.080]   Now, you've got all the money in the world, you undoubtedly have lots of friends and you're
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.200]   enjoying things and you've got adventures, but how do you fill 50 to 70 years with pure
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   adventures?
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.760]   Let's say you're passionate about sailing, are you going to be passionate about sailing
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   for 50 years or are you going to be passionate about sailing for 10 years or 5 years?
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.680]   Maybe you have a different personality than I do, but I find that 5 to 10 years is enough
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.600]   for most things in my life.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.200]   And so I work really hard to try to make each decade different of my life, and I think this
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.760]   is a good approach to goal planning that you should set out for your life's book, your
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.200]   memoirs, set out for yourself 50 or 100 chapters and ask yourself, "What's going to be different
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.880]   about chapter 27 than 57?"
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   Well, children have this wonderful kind of normal natural effect of solving two problems.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:31.440]   One, they bring in a phased effect to life where let's assume that you have three children
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.040]   between the ages of 22 and 28.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.480]   Well, now at 38, you've got 10-year-olds and your adventures with 10-year-olds are much
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.980]   different with your youngest is 10 and you've got teens.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.480]   Your adventures in that phase of life are very different than when you had a bunch of
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.800]   small children and you went to the park and went to the beach with them and now you're
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.560]   traveling the world with them.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.600]   And then you're enjoying watching them come into their own and develop personalized interests
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.440]   and hobbies and you have the joy and the satisfaction of high school graduation and going to college
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.280]   and then graduating and attending their weddings.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.880]   And then as you age, you start to naturally gain more pleasure in relationships as your
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.280]   physical capacity may be declining.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.440]   And so you look forward to being 90 years old and bouncing your great-grandchildren
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.440]   on your knee.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.360]   You look forward to these aspects of life.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.840]   And as you perhaps physically slow down, now you have an opportunity to invest into your
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   children.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.080]   You can care for your grandchildren so that their parents are more freed up.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.320]   You can sow into them and share the wisdom of your experience.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.480]   It seems to me that if you don't have children, you miss out on these natural phases of life
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.240]   and it's much more challenging to understand how to fill all of the decades of your life
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.880]   and you have to work more diligently at it.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's not impossible, nor am I saying that's reason enough to have children.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.400]   But it's an observation that I have of helping people plan that it can be challenging if
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   you don't have children.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.160]   And then just the effect of aging.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.640]   If you reach 80 years old and you've done nothing but adventure for 50 years and you
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.220]   know that looking forward your adventures are going to be less, what can you do?
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.220]   It's challenging.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:15.120]   Now, you can still, I would say, harvest this even if you're not doing it with your own
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.720]   blood relations.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.840]   You may be 80 years old, pour into your nieces, your nephews, adopt children in some kind
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.280]   of big brothers, big sisters program or just work with the neighbor children.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:34.660]   I have throughout my life benefited enormously from single men and single women who invested
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.580]   into me in a powerful and consistent way even though they weren't blood relations.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.080]   And so consider bringing those things into your life.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.880]   On the whole, I've tried to ring the warning bell on this for probably three or four years
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   now.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.720]   But we should acknowledge that babies are good for society and the world.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.380]   We need more babies in the world today.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:05.220]   We are heading today toward a demographic collapse in most of the societies in which
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   we live.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   In some, it's worse.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.500]   In some, it's better.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.960]   But it's going to catch a lot of people by surprise.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.240]   And there are a couple of reasons for that.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.720]   Right now, global populations are rising and they will continue to rise for the next few
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   decades.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   So the total number of people in the world I think is projected to reach something like
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   eight and a half billion people before it starts to decline.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:33.960]   The reason for the rising population is not because we're having more babies.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.240]   On the whole, the world is already—am I getting this right?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   Jack checked me on this, but on the whole, the world is already below replacement rate.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.480]   I'm not sure if I can say that accurately on a global standard.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.240]   I would need to check the data on that.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.880]   But most of our societies are below replacement rate and far below replacement rate.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.960]   And that's spreading all around the world.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.840]   There seems to be an inevitable process that as we get richer, we have fewer and fewer
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.840]   children.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.320]   As we industrialize and as we move to cities, we have fewer and fewer children.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.360]   And nobody as yet has figured out how to crack the code and stem the losses on a societal
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:16.040]   basis with a few ideological and religious exceptions.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.200]   But this is going to surprise a lot of people because we're living in increasingly older,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.120]   more geriatric societies.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.560]   And this takes all of the youth and vibrance of a society and destroys it.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.400]   You have a bunch of old people fighting with each other and not enough young people to
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.480]   support them.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.520]   By the way, you can see this collapse with your own eyes if you look around you.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.460]   Let's briefly talk about demographic trends.
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:49.740]   In order for a population to have a stable size, every single woman in that population
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.360]   needs to have two children.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:58.280]   Technically, they often say 2.1 children, but let's just keep it simple, two children.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:05.400]   So in order for your population where you live to be stable, every single woman you
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.120]   know has to have two children.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.840]   Now, if you are like me, you know a lot of women who don't have two children.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.600]   Again, fine.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:23.280]   For every woman you know that has one child and not two, you must then know a different
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.160]   woman who has three children in order to maintain stability of population.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:36.360]   For every woman you know who has zero children, you must also know another woman who has four
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.760]   children over the fullness of her life.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:46.440]   So think about your personal sphere of social contact.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.040]   Think about your family, your neighbors, your friends, your company, your church, your social
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.200]   clubs, your country.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   Think about that.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:34:00.240]   And ask yourself, on the whole, if I make a list of all the women that I know, do we
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:09.440]   have on the whole an average of two children per woman?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.720]   The answer is almost certainly no.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.400]   And there you see demographic decline right in front of you.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.540]   Now, here is the more shocking thing about demographic decline.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:28.060]   To use simplified numbers, let's assume that you have a general population of 100,000 people.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:37.120]   And let's assume on the average that the population that you have of 100,000 people, that on average,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.720]   instead of having two children per woman and maintaining a stable population size, you
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:49.360]   have a generation that has one child per woman within that generation.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:58.640]   In the second generation, your population size would drop from 100,000 to 50,000.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:05.140]   Just one generation of an average of one child per woman continued down through it would
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.320]   guarantee the having of your population.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.960]   Now let's assume that you wanted to grow back from that 50,000 population size back up to
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.760]   100,000.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.880]   How many children would each woman in that population have to have in order for a population
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.980]   to grow from 50,000 to 100,000 people?
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.080]   The answer is four, four children per woman.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.280]   And so what is happening around the world is that there are many countries that have
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:41.160]   gone from a total fertility rate of certainly way below 2.1.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.000]   Average fertility rate in the United States I think is something like 1.6, 1.7.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.080]   You can check all these numbers out, I'm just speaking off the top of my head here, but
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   this is directionally right.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.240]   Some of the lowest fertility rates in the world are in Japan, South Korea is especially
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.520]   bad right now.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.720]   The average fertility, the total fertility rate in South Korea is something like 0.71
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.140]   or 0.7 children per woman as far as the total fertility rate.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:13.160]   That basically over the fullness of time leads to a collapse in a society's numbers fairly
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:19.600]   quickly because once you miss a generation of children, you don't even have enough children
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.640]   to repopulate the generation, let alone maintain it.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:30.560]   And so what is happening is we're actually far into the demographic crisis and it's unsolvable
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.360]   in many countries of the world.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   Why?
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.120]   Well, because we still have lots of older generations, so we still have lots of people,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:43.200]   but what we don't have enough of is we don't have enough 20-year-olds, 30-year-old women
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.080]   who are able to have children or even who want to have children.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.960]   We don't physically have enough.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.140]   Let's say that you could snap your fingers and you could convince all Italian women that
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.920]   for whatever reason they wanted to have lots of babies, and you could convince all South
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.040]   Korean women and all Japanese women and all Russian women that for whatever reason they
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.440]   want to have lots of babies, and it's a voluntary thing, I'm not into Chinese women, I'm not
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.920]   into forcing anybody to do anything, but let's assume that you could just magically do that.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.680]   These populations can't even replace themselves at this point in time because there's not
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.960]   enough women of childbearing age and the younger cohorts are even smaller.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.320]   That's what's happening, but not many people are paying attention to it.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.680]   So mark my words, what I tell people privately, over the next two or three decades, the most
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.960]   talked about crisis that we're going to be discussing is going to be population collapse.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.080]   Now is it going to be the end of the world as we know it?
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   I hope not.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   I don't think so.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.320]   I think we'll figure out some new solutions to it, but it doesn't lead to a very exciting
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.480]   future.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.840]   Having an old gray society is not good for innovation.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.000]   It's not good for any sense of excitement.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.440]   You just have a population of people that just want to bicker with each other constantly.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   There's not enough resources to go around and there's no sense of expansion.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:06.920]   Children are the ultimate resource and all of the problems that we face and that we have
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.340]   are going to be solved by children.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.160]   That's why societies that are rich in children, although they come with a whole other set
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.600]   of problems, they have a very different experience.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.440]   I have five young children.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.840]   My house is loud.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.980]   It's chaotic.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.920]   That's been the biggest surprise to me, having children, is how loud it is.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.840]   I work hard at it every day, quiet down.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.440]   It's a constant challenge.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.080]   But it is not boring.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.760]   It is filled with enthusiasm.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.920]   It is filled with a sense of the future.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.360]   My house is fun.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.040]   It's exciting.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.200]   It's a decent metaphor for societies.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.320]   Let's talk now in detail about the money.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.000]   The money matters and we need to properly consider how it matters.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.480]   Here's the general rule of money and children.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.200]   Children will cost you as much money as you have.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.120]   The general rule of children is they will always cost you as much money as you have.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.940]   If you have a little bit of money, you'll spend out that and your children will probably
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.600]   turn out fine.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.720]   If you have a lot of money, then you'll spend a lot of money and guess what?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.800]   Your children will probably turn out fine.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.780]   As best I can find, the amount of money that you spend on your child does not have any
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.720]   kind of measurably direct correlation to long-term success in life.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.920]   I think it probably helps.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.800]   I spend quite a lot of money on my children, more than many people, but on the whole, it
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:44.040]   just seems like it's one factor among so many that it's not particularly measurable.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:52.020]   One of the great challenges in some cultures as to why the society has so few children
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:58.820]   is that the social expectations around how much money you have to spend on children are
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.820]   so high.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.540]   But I want to point out that these are all social expectations.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.020]   These are rules that if you have the courage and the determination and the vision, you
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.020]   could just break them.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:12.360]   They're just social norms and you probably need to break some of them.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.060]   Most of us, let's say you don't have a lot of money, most of us live in societies that
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:24.100]   have developed systems for identifying talent and bringing it up and nourishing it, regardless
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.060]   of the financial capacity of a family.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.980]   In the United States, which is the country I know best, if you do well in school, you
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.940]   do well on your exams, you study, you're going to be found.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:42.900]   You're found by your PSAT scores and your SAT scores and your National Merit Scholar
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   stuff.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.180]   You're found and you're going to be coached and you're going to be provided for and you're
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.300]   going to be given an all expenses paid shot at college and ultimately that's going to
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.540]   be your ticket to high society.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.940]   You can break into the higher social class purely based upon your basic academic ability
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.240]   or other natural talents that you have been developing.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.260]   In addition though, even if we're not talking about purely academics, most of us live in
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.940]   societies in which most of the things that you need for a child, if you don't have a
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.660]   lot of money yourself and aren't sure if you can afford it, most of the things that you
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.700]   need for your child is provided with taxpayer money.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.980]   There's food and food support that helps you buy groceries.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.180]   There's housing money that's given to you.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:35.340]   Some countries have direct cash payments that are given to you if you live there, Kindergarten,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.060]   Germany and other variations in many societies.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.540]   If you need help with education, there's free government schools that you can send your
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.380]   children to and they can get a great education.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.780]   There's libraries available to you that have all of the resources of the world.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.860]   They have free computers.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.120]   The libraries have lending libraries of video cameras and video editing suites and podcast
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.140]   recording suites and that's to say nothing of even just the general equity in society
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.700]   filled with people who want to support children.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.460]   Most wealthy people who want to make an impact on the world, they start a scholarship fund
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.500]   or start some kind of support.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:17.220]   Most physicians that I work with spend and donate and invest days of their very valuable
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.500]   work to help the poor and indigent.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.220]   We live in societies in which we have lots of support.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.940]   You're not on your own.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.460]   So recognize that as a foundational thing, that your children are going to cost you what
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.460]   you have.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.300]   If you have a lot, you'll spend all that and if you have a little, you'll spend what you
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   have.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.140]   So on the whole, your children are probably going to turn out fine.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:41.340]   If you're present with them and you love them and you don't abuse them and you spend time
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.900]   with them and you encourage them, it'll all work out in the long run.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.940]   Now, let's say you're waiting to have children until you can afford it.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.660]   What is the specific monetary goal that you're waiting for?
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.220]   Here are some examples.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:02.300]   You might be waiting until you can get a job so that you have income.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.540]   That seems wise to me.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.860]   I think that's a really good idea.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:12.340]   If you are unemployed and you're not currently expecting a baby, then I think that you should
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.400]   go and get a job and have a source of income.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.020]   Being unemployed and having responsibility for other human beings isn't fun.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.620]   Now, the cool thing about it, remember what I said earlier, give it a year, you can probably
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.460]   find a job fairly quickly.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:32.620]   Even if today you found out that your wife or your girlfriend or yourself that you're
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:40.100]   expecting a baby, then usually you have six months, eight months to prepare for that.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.060]   Usually that's enough time to get a job and have a source of income.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.140]   But on the whole, if you're planning to have children, I would encourage you get a job
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.540]   before you have children.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.280]   Have a source of income.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.600]   Being unemployed and having responsibility for other humans isn't fun.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.820]   Now, maybe you have a goal such as making more money at your job.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.240]   Is that an appropriate reason to wait to have children?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.780]   I'd say maybe, but you should be really careful here.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:14.280]   Again, recognize that most of us live in a society where there's some social support,
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.240]   some form of social safety network.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.280]   That social safety network, it won't provide you with everything.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:28.380]   You can't just be a professional birther or a professional parent in any society.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.800]   But there's enough there to make up the difference in most societies.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.280]   So if you have some source of income, and that source of income is paired with government
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.440]   benefits and welfare programs and cash payments or whatever it happens to be in a society
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.840]   that you live in, then that's probably enough for you to make it.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:52.000]   Ironically though, in many societies, as your income increases, you may start to lose some
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.040]   of those benefits.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.720]   And so in some cases, making more money, just a little bit more money, can actually cost
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   you more.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.880]   I've worked with people who were teachers in this situation.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.640]   And if you're a teacher, at least in the United States where I have the most experience, you
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.840]   often make a very modest income.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.760]   But it's a steady income, but it's often a modest income.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.200]   And then if you have babies, then you probably qualify for government benefits.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.040]   And those things can make a difference.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.320]   But if you go and you make a little bit more money than a standard, say, government school
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.660]   teacher, you probably will lose the benefits, and now you actually have no more net income.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:34.600]   So you need to make not just a little bit more money, you need to make a big jump in
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   money.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.160]   And so if your goal is to make more money at your job, you need to start by saying,
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.320]   "How much more money do I need?
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.320]   And what do I need it for?"
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.720]   And as we talk about expenses, the nice thing about babies is they're not so expensive in
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.800]   the beginning.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.120]   Their expenses tend to rise, and then they tend to taper off.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.520]   So making more money is a good idea, and you should be careful of just making a little
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.140]   bit more money if you're losing out on some kind of social support network that is part
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.600]   of the government system where you live.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:15.200]   But also, you probably should be careful about waiting for that reason alone.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.880]   Are you trying to make more money to be able to afford the costs of birth, the costs of
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.120]   having a baby?
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:27.280]   And here I mean to the physical childbirth, prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.280]   care.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.120]   Well, this is valid.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.520]   And if you don't have the money, then you probably should work really hard and save
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.100]   the money for this.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:42.640]   In my experience, babies cost about $5,000 each in terms of the general costs.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.080]   That number will vary based upon various countries.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:52.880]   Right now, because of the demographic trends that I mentioned earlier, there's a big move
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.800]   in many countries to support mothers in the costs of birthing babies as well as to support
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.100]   parents in the costs of raising children.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.680]   We don't know if any of these programs are actually going to have an impact, but as we
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.560]   are wont to do in many problems, if we have a problem, let's throw some money at it and
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   see what happens.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.040]   And since governments have lots of taxpayer money to throw around, that's what's happening.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:22.100]   And so your costs of having a baby may be substantially less than $5,000, but that's
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.840]   been my experience is that babies often cost about $5,000.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.280]   A natural birth with a midwife seems to me that rates are about $5,000.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:39.120]   That includes, of course, prenatal care and birthing and postpartum care as well.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.600]   It could be less, it could be more.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:46.000]   Most midwives that I've spoken to, they really care about making sure that mothers receive
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.880]   proper medical care.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:55.280]   And if you don't have the money, I've known a lot of midwives that will just simply help
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.160]   you and serve you and provide the care because they want you to be healthy.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.320]   Midwives have a real passion for taking care of mothers and we should respect them for
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.320]   that.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.480]   So if you have the money, pay them.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.600]   But if you don't have the money, you can often receive that kind of care.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.680]   If you're going to have a hospital birth and working with an obstetrician, gynecologist,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.640]   I think the cost is often similar barring complications.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.120]   And you should go and investigate that, but similar barring complications.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.720]   In many cases, most people will have health insurance of some kind.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.360]   At least for me, health insurance, I've always had something like a $5,000 deductible.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:37.520]   And so basically, baby costs me $5,000 with health insurance and $5,000 without health
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   insurance and it's just the cost of a baby.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.600]   The good thing is that if you have health insurance, that if there are complications
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.880]   or extra expenses, then you're protected.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.640]   And so if there's a C-section, if there's a stay in something like the neonatal intensive
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.680]   care unit, then you're covered with protection for those costs.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.960]   And so you still have your deductible and other expenses, but it's probably not a catastrophic
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   expense.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.000]   In addition, if you don't have health insurance, but you don't have a lot of money, which again,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   I'm trying to help you afford babies, if you don't have a lot of money, then there's often
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.400]   some kind of government option for health insurance.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:22.480]   Most welfare programs have some form of pregnant mother and baby benefits.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.000]   So even if there's not benefits for your entire family, if you find yourself as an expecting
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.160]   mother and you need additional help, there's almost certainly some kind of government benefits
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.600]   to help pay for the cost of healthcare.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.440]   On the other hand, I would say you don't need to have health insurance to have a baby.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.080]   One of the things that bugs me, and I have to give my disclaimers, I hate giving disclaimers,
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.800]   I'm done with them, but I feel like I need to, I'm not saying don't have health insurance.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   I'm not saying to be stupid.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:57.960]   But what angers me enormously in our modern era is that responsible people have adapted
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:04.400]   or adopted, excuse me, have adopted for themselves a standard of responsibility that is historically
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.600]   unlike anything that has ever happened in human history.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:16.120]   Throughout human history, in every age, if you got sick, you got sick and you paid a
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.600]   doctor to provide you with care.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.800]   Now we live in a system in which we've developed elaborate systems of mutual insurance and
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.960]   all kinds of stuff, and so people feel like they're morally wrong if they don't have these
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.720]   kinds of programs.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.520]   Is it wise for you to have insurance?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.600]   100%, absolutely.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.320]   If you can afford it, should you have health insurance?
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.640]   100%, absolutely.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.280]   But the fact that the medical marketplace is as screwed up as it is, is not your fault.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.440]   It's the fault of the health insurance system.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.800]   And at the end of the day, you're not fundamentally morally irresponsible if you don't have health
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   insurance.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.880]   So there are people out there who spend their lives caught in this kind of moral crisis.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.880]   If I have to be a responsible human being, and a responsible human being means I have
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.600]   to have health insurance and car insurance and all this stuff, hear me clearly, you should
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.700]   have those things if you can afford it.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.200]   But if you don't have them or you can't afford it, you're not morally wrong for not having
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.400]   those things.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.320]   It may be unwise, it may not be ideal, and you want to change it when you're able to,
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.360]   but you're not morally wrong.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.200]   So if you don't have health insurance and you have a baby, guess what?
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.400]   Number one, we talked about government programs, let's say you don't qualify for those.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.520]   If you don't have health insurance, you'll go work out a plan with your doctor or your
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.760]   midwife or the hospital, and you'll just pay the bills.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.960]   And when they send you an enormous inflated bill of X bazillion thousands of dollars that
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.000]   you owe, you'll say to them, "I don't have the money.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.880]   I can't pay that," and you'll negotiate a payment that you can't afford.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.640]   Because after all, I don't have health insurance and you're charging me ridiculous absurd inflated
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.380]   health rates for this.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.920]   So you'll work out a plan.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.560]   If you don't have insurance and they give you an enormous bill, they're going to provide
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.120]   the care for you, and you're going to pay them what you can afford to pay them, and
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.960]   the rest of it goes away.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.840]   Remember that most hospitals in the United States began their life not as a commercial
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:21.960]   enterprise, as a money-making thing, but as a form of ministry, normally a Christian ministry.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.720]   We all want to help people who are sick, and that's the basic function of a hospital.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.840]   Now, it's proper and right that if you receive care and you receive services, that you should
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.080]   pay for those things.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.380]   That's your proper responsibility, if you can afford it.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:41.920]   If you don't have money, then we still want to care for you, and you should take the care
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.800]   and then pay what you're able to.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.480]   So if you go into a system where you go into a hospital, and the hospital says, "You owe
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:55.600]   us $100,000," and you don't have $100,000, it's morally appropriate for you to pay what
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.360]   you can afford to pay and not pay a ridiculous bill.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.040]   I hope I'm shooting up the middle on this stuff, because there's two extremes that are
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   unacceptable.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   Extreme number one is the extreme where you refuse to pay money that you can afford to
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.680]   pay for services and care that are rendered unto you.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.680]   That is wrong.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.720]   It's unethical, and you must not do it.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.000]   You don't want that in your character.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.320]   You don't want that on your conscience.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.800]   You don't want to be the kind of person who is a taker and not a giver.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   But on the flip side, a system has been developed that makes it impossible for a normal person
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.160]   to pay for his bills, and you're not responsible for that either.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.720]   So you pay what you can afford to pay, and you work it out, and you negotiate a settlement
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.280]   or whatever you need to do with the healthcare provider.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.040]   And if it takes you a few years to pay off your bills because you didn't have health
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   insurance, fine.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.440]   And if you have to negotiate and they forgive 80% of the bill and you pay 20%, that is perfectly
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.980]   fine, perfectly just, perfectly ethical.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:01.160]   This is one of the reasons I care so much about doing proper asset planning protection
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:10.800]   for people, because there's an enormous group of people who don't get good asset planning
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.880]   advice.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.280]   Rich people get good asset planning advice, and they go out and they put in place elaborate
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.880]   asset protection schemes.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.200]   Poor people don't have any assets to protect, but ordinary, normal people often get terrible
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   advice.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.440]   And a guy will go in and he lost his health insurance because of a screwed up health insurance
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:34.720]   marketplace and he winds up with a $50,000 hospital bill, and he'll go rate his 401(k)
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.960]   and take $50,000 out and pay it.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.040]   Don't do that.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.800]   Pay the money that you have and keep all of your asset protected assets alone and work
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.160]   it out with the hospital.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.040]   Pay it over time, take a negotiated settlement, declare bankruptcy, do whatever you've got
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.960]   to do, but protect yourself.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.920]   You are not living in a free market.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.400]   I used to sell health insurance.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.360]   When the Affordable Care Act was passed under President Obama, what we lovingly call Obamacare,
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.600]   I, at the time, was a health insurance agent.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.440]   I have a designation called registered health underwriter.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.400]   In theory, I should know something about health insurance.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.000]   I've forgotten most of it, but in theory, that's the idea.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.120]   I looked at the health insurance marketplace, and I could not come up with any way that
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.040]   the Affordable Care Act was going to keep a functional market.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:28.080]   I half-heartedly, most-heartedly adopted what sounds like a conspiracy theory, which is
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:33.680]   basically to say that the Affordable Care Act was designed to basically destroy health
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.960]   insurance so that the United States could finally transition to a single-payer government
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.640]   health care system.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.800]   It sure seems like that's about what has happened.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:49.180]   Now, the country hasn't yet transitioned to a single-payer health care system.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.880]   It's my general belief that that probably will happen.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.200]   I don't know of anyone that's happy with the current system.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   It's a nightmare.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   It's an absolute nightmare.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.560]   It has almost none of the benefits of a free market system and none of the benefits of
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.960]   a government system.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.120]   So you get the worst of both worlds.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:10.200]   Government systems have a whole set of benefits and a whole set of disadvantages, and free
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.400]   market systems have a whole set of benefits and a whole set of disadvantages, and we don't
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.500]   get either of them in the United States.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.200]   Now because I don't know anyone that's happy with the situation, and because there's no
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:26.520]   moral discussion seeking to overturn all of the government health insurance that exists
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.080]   right now, there's nobody that says, "Well, it's not right for government to take money
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.880]   from taxpayers and give it to other people in the form of welfare programs."
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.480]   That's not even a position at the table in the U.S. system.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:45.120]   Because of that, I assume that a single-payer government program is inevitable.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.900]   It's just we don't know when it's going to get there.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:51.180]   So in the meantime, we're left with an absolute nightmare of a system.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.180]   So who knows?
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.960]   My point is that you protect yourself, and if you don't have health insurance, you'll
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.620]   deal with it at the time with whatever way is appropriate.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:03.620]   If you don't have health insurance, quite literally, go to Mexico and have your baby
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.620]   there.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.620]   You can go to Mexico.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.620]   You can have your baby.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:07.620]   You can pay for the baby.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.620]   Your baby will get two passports.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.620]   You get yourself a Mexican residency.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:13.900]   Why don't you stay there for 18 months and get yourself a citizenship, another citizenship
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.920]   while you're at it, and have access to a functional health care system where you can actually
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.260]   afford to pay your doctors instead of the nightmare in the United States?
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:26.580]   So is making money to afford the birth a good reason to wait?
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.580]   Sure.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.080]   But it shouldn't take you that long to save $5,000.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.740]   Remember that when I said, "If you need something, make it about a year?"
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.740]   That's what I mean.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.740]   Is that, "Do you need a job?
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.740]   Sure.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.740]   You can get a job in a year.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.740]   Do you need to save five grand?
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.740]   You can get a job and have a baby."
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.680]   Do you need to make a little bit more money at a job?
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.700]   Focus on it for a year and see if you can get yourself a raise and a promotion, and
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.480]   you'll be in good shape.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.820]   What other expenses are associated with having a baby?
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:00.100]   Well, do you need to make more money so that you can get the baby stuff?
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.740]   You're going to spend as much money as you have on the baby stuff.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:08.620]   If you have a lot of money, you're going to go out and you're going to redecorate the
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:16.000]   nursery and you're going to spend $10,000 on all the fancy gear and this bazillion dollar
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.660]   crib and this, I forget the name of it, the multi-thousand dollar thing that jiggles your
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:26.520]   baby when your baby starts to wake up, and a camera system with 18 cameras and alerts
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.300]   and all the stuff.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   Great.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   Go for it.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.740]   If you don't have any money, you're going to have a baby.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.580]   You're going to stick the baby in a cardboard box or get a dresser drawer from a dresser
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:43.020]   on the side of the road and put a little bed in it and put it beside your bed, and guess
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.020]   what?
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.020]   The baby doesn't care.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:52.020]   The baby is not going to know whether he's in a $5,000 crib and the Rocky thingy that
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:56.300]   is pretty cool, or if he's sitting in a cardboard box.
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.300]   Nobody knows.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.300]   It's a baby.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.300]   They don't care.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   They don't have a clue.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.900]   At the end of the day, the amount of money that you spend on the crib and the nursery
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.980]   and all that stuff is not going to make any difference.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:12.580]   And what will happen is, number one, most of the stuff that you need for a baby, your
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.980]   friends will give you when you have a baby shower.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.300]   Why do we have baby showers?
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:22.260]   We have baby showers to give poor people money and stuff that they need to have a baby because
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:27.580]   we know that young couples who can have babies, they don't have money.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:32.420]   Recognize that there's these societal artifacts that exist in our society.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.980]   Things like a wedding shower, things like a baby shower, things like wedding gifts.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:43.500]   All of these are inherited ways that we've developed as a society to support young people
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.380]   on the pathway that leads to societal health, marriage and babies.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.740]   We want to support that.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:56.980]   So that's why we have these traditions of bridal showers, wedding gifts, and baby showers.
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:05.460]   What happens though is in our hyper-intensive individualistic system that we live in today,
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:12.340]   we have this thing that somehow in order for me to be responsible, I have to do it alone.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.940]   And I appreciate individualism, but you're never going to be able to do it alone.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.500]   And if you do that, you take it to the extreme and you say, "Well, I've got to be 35 years
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   old.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.100]   I've got to have $3 million in the bank so I'm financially independent so that if I can't
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.180]   go back to work after I have a baby, then I'm good."
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180]   And it's nonsense.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:33.420]   You don't even replace yourself and you don't even replace your family in society.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.380]   It doesn't work for the long term.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.900]   So if you want to be part of society and want to contribute, and again, have children for
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.860]   your own selfish reasons, great, go for it.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:49.060]   But also recognize that you're part of society and we want to support you.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.300]   I don't like going to baby showers for rich people because you just – I don't go to
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.300]   baby showers.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300]   My wife does.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   But you know what I mean.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.300]   It's like what's the point?
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.160]   You know, some couple – it's like the stupidity of a bridal shower for a couple that's been
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.620]   living together for 10 years and they're independently wealthy and they have two jobs
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.300]   and they're going to have a bridal shower to prepare for their wedding after they've
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.220]   been living together for 10 years.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.780]   Now, obviously, you do your best.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.820]   You want to support your friends and whatnot, but it's like you have this vestige of something
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:22.820]   that's completely silly.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.380]   Am I going to give you a crock pot when you've been living together for 10 years and you've
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.820]   got a $300,000 household income?
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.100]   You don't need that.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.460]   And so obviously, the wealthy people, they defray it and you just have a party for the
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.460]   fun.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.380]   I'm not unreasonable in what I'm saying.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:45.860]   What I'm saying is there's something beautiful about – I love to get a wedding invitation
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.060]   to a young couple who doesn't have a lot of money, who's getting married.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.900]   And even as I said in the previous podcast episode, maybe you're in college.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.460]   It would – I don't get these, but it would thrill my heart if in the coming years I got
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:07.900]   a wedding invitation from a 20-year-old engaged couple and they said, "You know what?
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.300]   We have a little tiny dorm.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.900]   We're living in on-campus housing or a little tiny apartment.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   We have a little bit of space.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.020]   What we really could use is wedding gifts to help us finish off our college tuition."
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:22.900]   I would be so thrilled to put a big stack of money in that couple's hand.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:27.660]   And because at its core, that's our responsibility as a society.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.140]   We have a responsibility to support young people who are building the future generation.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.780]   And the same thing with regard to babies.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.940]   My wife and I – this actually was the first baby shower I've ever gone to and I felt
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   miserable.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.580]   I don't like the idea of co-ed baby showers.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580]   But I went to it.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580]   I was a good sport.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.540]   And we went to a baby shower for some pretty poor people.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:52.100]   And they were having a baby, a young couple and not married but had a baby and we went
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.700]   to – and we wanted support.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.180]   And it was just such a blessing.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.140]   My wife is into cloth diapers and she had accumulated so many cloth diapers that she
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:05.300]   was able to give this young couple basically all the cloth diapers that they would ever
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:09.220]   need for this baby and however many other babies that they would need.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.660]   And it just felt like – it felt awesome, right?
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.940]   Here you are with a woman who could have killed her baby but instead she's a young woman,
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.300]   doesn't have a lot of money, she's going to care for the baby, love the baby and it
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:27.500]   felt great to be able to support her with a significant financially valuable donation.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.660]   And those are the kinds of things that I think we should take pleasure in as a society.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.660]   Now here's the other point about getting baby stuff.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:39.860]   Number one, you don't really need most of what you think you need and you really only
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.620]   need to get most of it once.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:47.420]   Once you have one set of baby stuff, it can last you for three, four, five, however many
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   babies generally.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:52.220]   If you have boys, they destroy the clothes and you got to buy more clothes for them.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.780]   But if you have girls, you can pass them on through five generations of girls and it works
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   fine.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.460]   So I'm being a little bit flippant but it's real is that each additional baby doesn't
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.340]   cost all that much more because you wind up having the stuff.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:12.740]   And as your skill grows, you wind up thinking, "What a pain to have all this extra stuff."
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:17.700]   I think most parents, even if you're not hyper minimalist, most parents, you look back on
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.740]   the stuff that you registered for at your first baby shower and you recognize, "I didn't
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.620]   need all that stuff and what a hassle to have this fancy baby trash can that dumps the diaper
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:31.140]   upside down and this thing sticking around in my house and I didn't need all this play
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.140]   equipment."
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:39.260]   With our most recent baby, usually you buy some things and you have walker things for
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.260]   the baby.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.740]   We had our fifth baby and we'd gotten rid of a lot of the baby toys.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.260]   We didn't have many of them.
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.060]   But we just never bothered to go out and get it because what we discovered is that the
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:55.140]   baby enjoys pushing a chair around when he's learning to walk just as much as pushing a
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:58.220]   special baby walking device.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.140]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:07.620]   My kids found on the side of the road an office chair and I let them bring home things like
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.860]   that when they enjoy it for time and I try to pass it along.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.500]   But it gives them a few days of taking stuff apart and putting it together and creating
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.920]   all the creations and it's creative.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.500]   So I left the chair around.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.220]   And anyway, the seat of the chair came off the base and he was left with the base of
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.220]   this office chair.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:30.260]   What turned into the perfect baby walking device is that my wife gave it to the baby
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:36.760]   and he trots around the house holding the office chair as his support mechanism.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.820]   And on the whole, does any of it matter?
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.820]   No.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:45.380]   And so that's my point is you don't need that much money for those things in the fullness
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.380]   of time.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.060]   Do you need to make more money or do you have a financial goal so that you can feed your
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.060]   children?
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.540]   Now, here's where we get into some of the real costs.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.820]   Feeding your children is indeed a real cost.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.660]   And there are some good things about it though.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:06.620]   First of all, if the mother is able to breastfeed, then generally speaking you don't need much
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.000]   extra food for the baby, at least for about a year.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.140]   So you have time to work it out.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.380]   And when the baby starts eating, usually it's not that much.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:21.340]   Most of your food just goes to support the mother in her pregnancy and in her postpartum
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.340]   recovery.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:26.700]   So you have a year to figure out the money stuff to feed your baby.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:32.340]   You definitely do spend more money on your food budget with babies, and the number can
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.500]   be significant, especially if you've got a house full of teenage boys.
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:41.820]   But I think, and I think we need to acknowledge that parents and families spend more on food
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:46.900]   than singles and dinks, but it's not a multiplicative more.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:55.900]   It's not like in my family I spend seven times more on my food than you do as a single man
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.940]   or single woman.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.260]   It's not the case.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.020]   It is more, but it's a marginal more, not a multiplicative more.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:10.040]   I think part of the reason for this is there tends to be some recharacterization of expenses.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.820]   Food is actually astonishingly cheap in our current society.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:20.380]   Maybe it won't always be cheap, but it is astonishingly cheap in our current society,
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:29.380]   and you can get a good nutritious diet from your local grocery store for a shockingly
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.060]   low amount of money.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:38.340]   What has happened is we don't think of that as being a normal diet anymore, and so we
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:45.380]   have upgraded our expectations, our tastes of what is normal based upon our affluence
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.940]   as a society.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:55.220]   So all people, singles, dinks, and families today spend a lot of money in ways that is
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.980]   historically astonishing because of our level of affluence.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:05.140]   When I was single, and even still, when I travel by myself, I just feel like I have
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.620]   the cheapest lifestyle in the world.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.860]   I go out to eat all my meals.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   I don't cook anything.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:15.420]   I just go out to eat, and I – look, I recently went – I was traveling and I went to a steak
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:20.620]   dinner and got a steak dinner and bought all the stuff, and I texted my wife.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:27.220]   I was like, "I just got an appetizer, and I got a meal, and I got two drinks, and I
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.220]   got dessert," and I sent her my receipt.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.580]   I said, "Look how cheap it is.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   This is amazing."
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.820]   So when you're a father and used to feeding seven people when you go out to restaurants
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.940]   and you go out as one, it just feels like the most amazing deal in the world.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.860]   It changes your perspective.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.540]   But single people go out to eat all the time.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540]   They eat in very inefficient ways.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.540]   They buy all the expensive food that's not necessary, and so their food budget tends
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.920]   to be a certain amount, similar with couples that have resources.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   They go out to eat all the time.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.500]   They spend lots of money on just lifestyle.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:02.740]   What happens when you are parents is you tend to change how you spend money.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:08.340]   You tend not to go out to restaurants, partly for the cost because the numbers just don't
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.440]   make sense.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:15.900]   I can feed my family an amazing steak dinner with all the sides, plenty of food, all the
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.700]   stuff, for about the cost of what a steak dinner with all the stuff at a restaurant
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.860]   costs for one or one and a half people.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.500]   And so it's like, "Why would I go out and spend seven times as much when I can create
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.440]   better food inside?"
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   Part of it is the cost.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.040]   Part of it also is the atmosphere, the environment, that restaurants are not generally fun places
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.340]   when you have young children.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.300]   The children often don't have a lot to do.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:45.760]   It's kind of a weird environment, and they're not as comfortable, and you feel the eyes
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.740]   of the world staring at you, and so you're constantly on your guard.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.420]   So most young families, going out to eat is just not as fun.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.860]   When the children are better trained and they're past the stage, and they're at the stage where
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:01.500]   they can be held accountable for their behavior, then at that point in time, going out to restaurants
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.420]   is more appropriate.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:09.100]   But parents spend more than singles and couples do, but they spend it differently.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.420]   And it's very common then that you learn how, if we're going on a trip, we're not just going
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:16.660]   to stop and eat fast food, but we'll prepare a picnic, we'll take our food with you.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.980]   And so you start to plan ahead a little bit more.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:24.440]   So your food bill will increase with children, but I would say you probably can afford it
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.860]   if you're willing to adjust how you spend your money.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.180]   And recognize that the way that you think you should spend your money is probably historically
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.180]   abnormal.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:37.380]   I grew up as the youngest of seven children.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:41.560]   My parents didn't have a lot of money, they didn't earn a ton of money.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.180]   We went out to a restaurant as a family, I would say, once every six months.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.220]   I mean, it just wasn't a thing.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:54.660]   And my family with children, my children have been in a hundred times more restaurants than
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.020]   I ever was as a child.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.100]   Does that make it better or worse?
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.620]   I don't see the difference.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.520]   It's just something different, it's just a different experience.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.260]   And so if you want to have more children and you can't afford them, but you actually want
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.300]   to have more children, just change how you spend it.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.260]   You will spend more, but change how you spend it.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.540]   By the way, one comment on the question I said about groceries, and I said groceries
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.660]   are shockingly cheap.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.260]   I'm not blind to the cost of food.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:28.460]   When I'm saying that, I'm saying it from a historical perspective that the amount of
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:33.940]   money that we spend on food is less of our labor than it ever has been in the history
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.220]   of mankind.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.900]   But again, back to the core elements.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:45.660]   If you wanted to have an amazingly healthy meal, a healthy diet for a few dollars a day,
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660]   what could you do?
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:51.500]   You could eat for a few dollars a day and have an unhealthy diet, but for breakfast,
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   go out and get eggs.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.620]   I don't know what the eggs cost where you are, but it's going to be a few dollars for
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.660]   a bunch of eggs.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:01.780]   My family, we eat eggs most mornings, I usually do about 25 eggs every morning.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:05.580]   So it doesn't cost that much to have 25 or 30 eggs.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.220]   It's some dollars.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.900]   For lunch, get yourself, and by the way, milk.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:14.220]   Milk is kind of your other normal thing.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:18.900]   So wherever you live in the world, you can buy a gallon of milk pretty inexpensively,
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.980]   and it's packed with calories, packed with nutrition, packed with vitamins.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.160]   Get raw milk if you can, but even if you can't, it's just relatively inexpensive.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.900]   Thanks for calling Toyota.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   This is Jan.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.900]   Hi, Jan.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.660]   My kids are really excited about spring break, so I'm looking for a new Toyota to help make
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.660]   it amazing.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.340]   Now until April 1st is a great time for a new Toyota.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   Imagine you and the kids in a tundra on your way to the lake to go speed boating.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.740]   Or even taking a RAV4 to an animal sanctuary to pick goats.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:50.780]   Sounds like your kids aren't the only ones excited about spring break.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   Ready, set, go get your Toyota today.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780]   Toyota.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   Let's Go Places.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   Dealer inventory may vary.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.460]   See your participating Toyota dealer for details.
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:00.300]   For lunch, make hamburgers.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.260]   Skip the bread, get a big thing of ground beef, make up some hamburger patties, add
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.260]   garlic and salt, add some tomatoes and lettuce and pickles.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:14.500]   Pretty inexpensive and you can have a calorie filled, vitamin, nutrient filled lunch.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.060]   For dinner, make pork butt.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.940]   Pork butt and potatoes or something.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.020]   Put it in the crock pot, steam it, instapot it, make shredded pork.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:28.060]   It just doesn't cost much to have a superfood diet of meat and filled with vitamins and
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.840]   protein and all the stuff that you need.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.740]   You can do it pretty inexpensively.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:39.140]   Where the money goes is on the organic pine nuts and on the, you know, the fresh salmon
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.880]   flown in from Tibet and all the stuff.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.700]   And that's the stuff that we now consider normal.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.220]   It's just part of our diet.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.180]   So if you can afford it, go for it.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:53.060]   But if you're trying to feed your children, you can do it on a very modest budget if you
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.180]   pay attention to the stuff that you buy.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:01.220]   And then at the poor end, if you genuinely don't have money and genuinely can't afford
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.540]   it, then there's government money and government systems that are there to provide for food
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:11.020]   costs for your children if you're genuinely poor.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.940]   Do you need to make more money in order to be able to afford to educate your children?
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.260]   This is a big one.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:26.160]   In this case, most of our pressure towards education is a cultural pressure that is probably
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.580]   largely unnecessary.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.420]   Just this week, I was reading an article, I forget the publication, but it's talking
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.420]   about South Korea.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.580]   South Korea, again, perhaps one of the world's lowest birth rates right now.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:43.540]   And evidently in South Korea, being the Asian tiger stereotype, there is a strong cultural
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:49.340]   pressure that in order for your children to succeed, not only do they have to do all of
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.060]   the standard schools, the government schools, but you have to spend huge amounts of money
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.940]   so they have tons of extra tutors to cause them to be absolute star students because
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:00.660]   you have this hyper-competitive society.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:08.200]   And this is almost a perfect storm of a sick society where you create enormous pressure
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.820]   on people in their school life, their work life, and the pressure winds up destroying
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.960]   the resource that you're trying to enhance.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.580]   You're doing all this work to try to help the educational pathway of your culture, and
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.060]   at the end of it, you're going to wind up with no culture because you have no people.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.500]   And this is unnecessary.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.260]   It's unnecessary.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:40.340]   First, all of us have access for free to all of the learning resources that any of us would
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   ever need.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:50.360]   And access to good resources coupled with benign neglect is probably sufficient and
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:59.220]   in many cases superior to a hyper-intensive tiger mom, tiger dad lifestyle.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:04.060]   I find the stories of the unschoolers really inspiring here.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:09.700]   I've always been inspired by the unschoolers who basically work really hard to expose their
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:16.900]   children to great resources and then to allow the child's curiosity to take him or her to
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:24.660]   where he wants to go, and in general, broadly speaking, the results that they get from this
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.500]   kind of benign neglect – it's not neglect, I'm not accusing – I mean, in some cases,
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.540]   some are neglectful, but I'm not accusing broadly the philosophy of unschooling as being
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.540]   neglectful.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:39.860]   What I'm saying is kind of a hands-off, figure-it-out-for-yourself-buddy kind of approach, and in many cases, this
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:49.360]   produces an outcome that is equivalent to going through the traditional program.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.540]   It's got a good argument for it.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.020]   I find it inspiring.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:17:01.260]   Never before in the history of humanity have we had access to more resources for free.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:07.460]   All of the greatest books that your child can read to be well-educated are all public
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460]   domain.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.620]   They're free.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.780]   All you need is some way to read them, so you can get yourself a digital e-reader device.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:18.780]   You can get a printer, a cheap printer, and print them out yourself.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.400]   There's plenty of access to them.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   You have a local library.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.260]   That local library has all the books in it, and what's more is there's free book sales.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.620]   They give away the good ones after a while, and they're all available to you for free
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.340]   in your local library.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.740]   In addition, you have all of the Internet resources that you need, and so there's everything
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:44.660]   from Khan Academy to all kinds of stuff, and you can access all that stuff for free.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.540]   If you don't have a computer, don't have Internet, go to your library and go on there for free
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.540]   and study there.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:58.180]   All of the educational resources that any boy, any girl, any adolescent, any man or
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:04.880]   woman needs to become well-educated are all available for free or practically for free
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.060]   in today's world, so you absolutely can afford it.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.220]   You already have a phone.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.420]   You already have a computer.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.340]   You already have Internet at your house.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.460]   You can afford it.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.420]   Is it nice to spend more money than that?
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.460]   I think so.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:23.060]   I spend a lot more money than that, so children will cost you what you have.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:26.500]   I spend as much money as I have on my children's education.
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.740]   It's important to me, and you'll do the same thing, but do I think my children are much
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.500]   better educated?
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.180]   I would say they're better educated than a lot of people, but some of the areas in which
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:43.140]   I spend the most money I wouldn't argue are that important.
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:47.940]   I mean, as an example, I spend all kinds of money shipping in foreign books in foreign
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.620]   language from all around the world.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.980]   I spend a bunch of money getting physical books that are free, that are public domain,
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.380]   that I could just put on a Kindle in the hand of a Kindle, but I am trying to cultivate
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:06.940]   the power of attention and deep focus and all these languages, and I spend—so is it
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940]   better?
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.020]   Yeah, but do I think that you genuinely need to speak seven languages to be successful?
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.020]   Of course not.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.340]   That's nonsense.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.260]   You don't need any of that, and is it going to pay off?
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.620]   I have no idea.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.940]   Ask me in 30 years.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.940]   We spend the amount of money that we have based upon our perceptions and our goals,
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:31.180]   but on the whole, it's one of those 80/20 analyses that 80% of the results, the educational
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:38.300]   results that your child is going to get come from interest and time and good resources.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:44.380]   20% may come from you having the world's best pedagogical approach and great coaching.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:48.500]   It's just not that significant on the whole.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.020]   Where you really start to spend money when it comes to educating your children is if
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.900]   you—so the big one is paying for private schools.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.300]   One reason I homeschool is clearly financial.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.040]   I have five children.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.660]   If I were paying private school tuition, it would be $100,000 a year.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:12.260]   I count the cost of spending $100,000 a year on private school tuition, I look around,
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:16.940]   and I say, "I can do a whole lot better and at least more interesting for them and
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.900]   for me with $100,000 a year."
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.380]   I am happy to spend money on it, but that only is if you have $100,000 a year.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.020]   If you don't have $100,000 a year, you wouldn't spend it.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.940]   There are private schools that are available that are cheaper and there are plenty of no-tuition
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.900]   government schools available.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.900]   You can homeschool with no tuition as well.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:41.700]   Khan Academy is available for anybody who needs it now in not any language, but at least
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.900]   a dozen languages and growing all the time.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.940]   In English, it's all available.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.420]   Private schools are certainly one thing.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.660]   If you have the money, you'll spend it.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.020]   If you don't have the money, you'll find another way around it.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:21:01.060]   Where a lot of the money comes in is on experiences, things like great trips and special classes
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.980]   and special tutors.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.820]   I say go for it if you have it.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.800]   I recently was talking with my friend Mikel Thorup from Expat Money, and he's amazing.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:15.740]   He has his children, and they've got a private art teacher who works with his children multiple
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:21.320]   days a week and a private piano teacher who teaches them piano and Russian and a competitive
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.620]   jiu-jitsu gym and karate and martial arts, and that's kind of normal.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:30.680]   When you have the money, you wind up buying all the stuff, and you've got gymnastics and
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.520]   parkour and ballet, and there's no limit to the amount of classes that you can do.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.800]   Those things are expensive.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:40.400]   When you start signing all your children up for all the activities, they're just crazy
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.120]   expensive, huge cost.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.520]   I spend it on travel.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:53.320]   Last year, I took my children to 16 countries, spent the equivalent of a new car on it, a
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.880]   modest new car.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.120]   Do my children care?
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   They care.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.480]   They enjoy it.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:07.720]   They sort of, but is it superior than if we just spent the same time together at a local
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.160]   park, local state park, camping in the woods, hanging out?
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.160]   I wouldn't argue it's that much superior.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.320]   It's probably more interesting.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.760]   It's more interesting than for me.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   I like it.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:24.640]   It's kind of fun to go into the fancy cathedral and to go to the museums.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.880]   It's kind of interesting, but on the whole, I wouldn't argue it's that much different.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.280]   It's just different.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.520]   What I mean is that much better.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.600]   It's just different.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.840]   One person grows up hanging out in the woods, and then he takes himself to Europe and tours
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.200]   the cathedral at 19.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.360]   I took my children when they're young.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   Is it worth it?
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:50.720]   Again, it comes down to you spend the money that you have, and beyond that, people work
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   it out.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:56.480]   There's plenty of people who have lived wonderful, successful lives, and they never left the
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.920]   city or county they were born in.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.000]   And so I don't think that it's just fundamentally better.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.080]   What happens is we have so few children in the modern world that we try to make up for
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.680]   it by spending a bazillion dollars on them.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:17.760]   So the classes and all of the stuff that we do and the gymnastics and the things, we spend
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.120]   the money on it because we think it's good for them.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120]   Is it actually good for them?
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.580]   I don't think we know.
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:29.720]   We know that it can be damaging, meaning that having a very harried childhood where you're
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.440]   just trundled from one thing to the next and you never have any time, I think that's harmful
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.440]   for children.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.800]   I think it's better to have time.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.760]   Is the actual class itself damaging?
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   No.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.420]   Wouldn't it be great if you developed gymnastic skills?
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.440]   But are you going to produce a world-class swimmer because you go to swimming five times
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.720]   a week?
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.680]   Only if eventually your child is interested, and then he or she will develop the skills
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.320]   and pursue the process.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.680]   But you're not neglectful if you don't.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.560]   You're not neglectful if you teach your child to swim in a pond at a friend's farm or at
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.640]   the local public pool versus having the private coach.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.240]   It's just that we spend the money on the things that we have the money for.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.880]   So on the whole, children cost money.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:19.160]   They can cost substantial amounts of money, but they'll basically cost all the money that
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.280]   you have.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.240]   And so if you have a lot, you'll spend a lot.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.460]   If you don't have a lot, you'll spend a little.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.760]   And so it all comes down to do you want to have children?
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.680]   What is the biggest cost of children?
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:38.320]   I think generally speaking, the biggest cost of children is the lost career earnings for
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.480]   a stay-at-home mom or a stay-at-home dad.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.940]   That's where the biggest cost is.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.280]   So I have five children.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.680]   My wife and I couldn't have five children if she had a job and I had a job.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.900]   There's a few people out there that can do it, I guess, but it just seems like an insane
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.320]   hairy lifestyle that most people wouldn't want.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:08.040]   And so what happens is you can have children if you have the resources to have children.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:13.960]   And so because I work from home, because my wife is a stay-at-home mom, then we have more
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.440]   resources, more ability, more time.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.320]   We have less money, but we have more time.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.120]   And so that makes it less daunting to have a bunch of children.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.660]   And I've made the choice that my children will be my status symbol instead of consumption
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:34.560]   status symbols of things that I pay money that are shiny and go fast and look shiny
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.880]   on the water, et cetera, then I've just chosen that I would rather have my children be my
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   status symbol.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.440]   I derive a significant amount of pleasure from their company.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.640]   I love to spend time helping them.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.560]   I enjoy helping people succeed and I love being with them.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.880]   And so I feel an enormous amount of pride in them.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.520]   It's a significant component of my life and I'm looking forward to my grandchildren and
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   my great-grandchildren.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.640]   I want to build a family dynasty.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.280]   And so I'm happy to spend the money on it.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:12.560]   But the biggest financial cost is the cost of my wife not having a job and also the cost
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:24.040]   of her career, meaning that young women face a real challenge in today's world.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:32.480]   What we have done in the world that we live in is traditionally we had a society in which
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:39.200]   it was expected that men would support their wives and that the wives would bear children
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.640]   and would raise children and there was a symbiosis and society supported that.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.480]   There's a lot of talk in the political space about the concept of a living wage.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.400]   That's important and it's always been important.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.720]   But in general a core component of that is to talk about a living family wage is in times
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.200]   past it was expected that a father would be able to earn enough money to support his family
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.880]   with one income.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:16.320]   What's happened though is as we trace all of the trends forward till today, number one
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:23.800]   we doubled the supply of workers in the marketplace and it became much more difficult for a family
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.420]   to live on one wage.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:29.400]   We talk about a living wage now, we don't talk about a living family wage and so it's
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.840]   much more challenging to make the numbers work.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:40.900]   Many families genuinely challenged to make it work on a single income, very difficult.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.140]   Not impossible, just difficult.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:52.020]   In addition we have created enormous insecurity in marriage and that insecurity has made it
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.340]   difficult for young men and women to trust each other.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:01.180]   In marriage men are suspicious of women, women are suspicious of men, and the law, while
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:09.260]   certainly there is divorce law, the divorce law, especially in the wake of no-fault divorce,
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.940]   has led to instability in families rather than stability.
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:17.800]   The idea was that marriage is a stable institution.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.220]   One man, one woman committed to each other for life, in good times and bad times, better
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:28.900]   for worse, in wealth and poverty, for richer, poorer, in sickness and in health, supporting
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.340]   one another.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:35.660]   But we've stripped that out and we've traded it in for a system of personal autonomy and
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.460]   pleasure and I think this is a system that ultimately collapses, it has to collapse.
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:44.200]   Let me give you just one example and we're getting philosophical here but it's important
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.700]   to understand it.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:54.680]   When people talk about marriage, or when I talk about marriage, many people have a vestige
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:01.160]   of what marriage meant in the past that they no longer believe in or are committed to.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.700]   The example I like to use where I think that people still understand the value of marriage
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:05.700]   is this.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:13.960]   I want you to imagine that I'm 50 years old, whatever, 50 years old is a good age.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:23.520]   And I've been married for 25 years and I want you to imagine that my wife got sick, developed
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.780]   some kind of sickness, the specifics don't matter, and she became a bedridden invalid.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:33.080]   And so now my wife can't do anything for me.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.760]   She can't cook for me, she can't clean for me, she can't make money for me, she can't
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.140]   spend time with me, imagine she's sick all the time, she can't talk to me, we can't have
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:51.760]   sexual relations, just assume that she can't do anything for me.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   So I want you to imagine that I look out and realize, listen, I'm not happy in this relationship.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:04.840]   This woman is just a leech in my life, why do I have to do all this stuff for her?
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:11.620]   And so I divorce her, and I go off and I marry someone else who's better.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:19.040]   Imagine that you heard about those circumstances, what would you think of me if I did that?
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.480]   I think you would despise me, and I would say rightfully so.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:32.040]   I would despise any man who did that to his wife.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:38.160]   And we should, there should be a social shame, a social opprobrium that is brought against
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.760]   a man who would do that to his wife.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:49.160]   It's one of the most selfish and arrogant things that ever could be done.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.640]   The sense of that feeling that you have when I describe those circumstances, that sense
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:31:01.800]   of shame, and that despising of me, if I did that, that's right.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:07.840]   Because we know that marriage is not just about happiness, it's about much more than
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   that.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.200]   It's a basic fundamental institution of human society.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.640]   And we're not in it just because we're happy, that's not it.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.160]   There's something larger than that.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:22.240]   So now, let's use a different circumstance.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:26.960]   Let's say that I'm 50 years old, and I'm married to my wife, but let's just assume
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.560]   that she's not physically sick.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.480]   But she's just grown distant, we've kind of grown apart, after all, we raised children,
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.400]   we didn't keep knowing each other through the years, we raised a bunch of children.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:42.200]   And she says, "You know what," or I say, "I'm just not really happy anymore.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.880]   Maybe our sex life isn't great, I'm just not really happy anymore."
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.720]   And I was like, "I'd just like to try something new."
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:57.040]   And so I divorced my wife, and I go and find someone else and marry someone else and start
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.680]   over again.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.840]   How would you feel towards me?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.900]   In our current society, most people wouldn't despise me.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:11.600]   They would just say, "Hey man, you do you, you've got to be happy, whatever your life
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.840]   is about happiness, you need to be happy, you deserve to be happy, Joshua, or you deserve
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.440]   to be happy, wife."
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.320]   What's the difference?
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.760]   Functionally speaking, and I'm not here to preach about marriage, but that's at the core
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.360]   of one of the things that's really difficult.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:35.160]   So what has happened is men and women have internalized this in today's world, and that
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.920]   we don't trust one another anymore.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:43.880]   I think, I know women have significant amounts of problems of trust.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.000]   Men, it seems to me, have been waking up to this over about the last 10 years, and a lot
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.080]   of men feel like they can't trust marriage anymore.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.600]   And so this is causing men and women not to marry, it's causing men and women not to have
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600]   children.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:01.100]   And this is an enormous problem for this financial perspective, because in the lack of trust,
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:08.160]   if my wife knows that I would divorce her just because I'm not happy anymore, then now
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.320]   she feels like she's got to defend herself, and she feels like she's got to go out and
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.200]   she's got to make her own money, and she's got to have her own backup accounts, and she's
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.400]   got to make sure that she has her own career, because after all, I can't trust that my husband's
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.400]   going to be around here.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:24.120]   And this is a fundamental problem that is destroying one of many things that's harming
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120]   our birthright.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.000]   It's not one thing, it's many things.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.840]   I don't have any solutions for those things legally, meaning I could propose some suggestions,
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.100]   but I have no confidence at the moment that there's any social support for those.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.800]   It seems like it's going to have to get a lot worse before it gets better, until we
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.000]   kind of wake up and realize what we've lost.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.440]   But at the moment, what is possible is simply that individuals can see the problems and
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.440]   you can work your way through.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.800]   And that's this enormous paradox that we live in.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.880]   We live in a paradox in which, from a cultural perspective, things have "never been worse."
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.320]   But on an individual perspective, things have never been better.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.680]   And I see this paradox at many levels.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:09.400]   Things about like freedom, for example.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.080]   People want to go on and on about, you know, "Big Brother, Big Brother is watching all
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.960]   my communications and I can't do anything and there's too many laws."
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.800]   Well, that's true on a cultural perspective.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:24.840]   Never before in the history of mankind have human beings ever lived under the authority
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.680]   of as many laws and regulations and statutes as govern your life.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.360]   That's true.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:35.360]   But on the flip side, individuals have never been more free to just chart their own course
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.720]   than today.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.320]   If you went back a millennium, a thousand years, and you were stuck into a society,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.840]   you probably couldn't just strike out across the countryside because the people over there
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.800]   want to kill you.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.500]   You couldn't just go off and do whatever you wanted because you needed the land, you needed
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:56.260]   the support structure to be able to eat.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.540]   You had very little personal freedom.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:02.780]   So maybe there were fewer laws, but you had very little personal freedom.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.080]   You were completely connected.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.520]   Today, there's a lot more laws, but you can go your own way.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.520]   You can go from one side of the world to another in 24 hours.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.960]   You can do it all.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.460]   And it's like this on so many levels.
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.300]   Never before have schools been worse.
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.520]   That's a hard one to make, but you can say, "Well, schools have never been worse."
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.400]   Okay, yeah, but never before have you had more options to have a great education for
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.480]   nothing, for free.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:29.960]   And on almost everything, we see this paradox.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:37.680]   And so similarly speaking, when it comes to children and families and relationships, we
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.160]   have this cultural paradox that never before have we had fewer children, never before have
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:48.200]   we had such a high divorce rate and dissolution of families and destruction of marriage and
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   all this stuff.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.200]   Okay, that's all true.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:54.800]   But on the other hand, to some degree, it's never been easier for you to break through.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:00.360]   It's never been easier for you to have children and raise them and build strong families and
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:03.640]   earn money and live where you want to live and all these things.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.040]   So I can't solve the big cultural stuff.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.320]   I've got solutions I'd love to hear heard, but it's not the time.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:18.120]   But what I can do is I can take action myself, and I can use the systems that exist in order
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.080]   to fix that.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.320]   And so I can take care of my wife, and I can build the confidence in her and in me and
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.560]   in our relationship so that she's willing to be a stay-at-home mom.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.560]   She doesn't feel defensive.
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.420]   She doesn't feel like she has to protect herself.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.680]   But she can trust me.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.680]   I can build that.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.160]   That's the biggest cost of children, and it weighs heavily on moms, and we need to take
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.160]   care of them.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.540]   What's the big benefit of children, though?
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.540]   Children are highly motivating.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:51.640]   I think you'll probably do and make more having children than not, and I'm going to close
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.960]   with this train of thought.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.200]   As with anything, when we see data, we ask ourselves, "Is this causation or correlation?"
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.320]   We're all stats experts now is the first thing.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.400]   "Is this causation or correlation?"
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:11.740]   We know that parents with children make more money than people who don't.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:17.520]   We know that people who are married and have children have more wealth than those who don't.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.360]   And we say, "Well, is this causation or correlation?
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.320]   Are the children causal in this result?
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:29.360]   Is the marriage causal, or is it just that people who are rich get married and have children?"
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.840]   I can't prove to you one or the other.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.760]   All I can tell you is from personal experience and observation, I think that children are
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:41.120]   a causal factor in doing more in life, in changing your perspective, and in causing
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.320]   you to desire to be more ambitious.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.480]   It's probably not universal.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.180]   It's really not.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:53.000]   But when I think about myself before I ever had children, and I think of myself as a father,
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.960]   I don't even recognize the man that I was.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.400]   I don't even recognize the boy that I was.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:08.640]   My children have caused me to grow in so many ways, and it's very subtle how it happens.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.280]   A lot of it happens just in terms of confidence in yourself.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:20.140]   When you have humans, even if they're little humans, that adore you and respect you and
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:28.520]   love you, it changes your psychology in a really compelling way.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:34.400]   And a couple of examples from today.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.120]   One of my children is prone to saying, "Daddy, you're the best daddy in the world."
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.680]   I know that I'm not the best daddy in the world.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.100]   I do my best, but I'm not the best.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.840]   Obviously not, even if I could define that.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.040]   But when somebody says to you practically every day, "Daddy, you're the best daddy in
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.040]   the world.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:00.040]   I'm so grateful," you have this desire to be the best, and it causes you to do something
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   differently.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.720]   I've got a toddler in my house right now, and generally speaking, toddlers are a hassle.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.920]   But my toddler is right at that phase where when I walk in the door, wherever he is, if
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:17.760]   he hears that daddy's coming, comes running across the floor, arms up, "Daddy, pick me
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.080]   up."
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.040]   And you do that, and it changes you.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.160]   Men are transformed.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.480]   I guess probably women, too, but I'm not a woman, so I can't tell you.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.680]   But I know that men are transformed by bearing responsibility.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.000]   And when you have children, you have responsibility.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.880]   And authority and responsibility come together.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:46.240]   And my experience has been that as the burden of children has come more heavily onto me,
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.960]   and I bear that responsibility, recognizing that truly if it's to be, it's up to me.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.640]   I've got to keep this human alive.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.320]   I can't be lazy.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320]   I can't be...
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.320]   I got to take...
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320]   It's me.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.960]   It's my job.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:09.740]   As that responsibility rests heavily on my shoulders, what winds up happening is I sense
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:13.440]   it develops me, and that responsibility rests on me, and it develops me, and it causes me
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.480]   to be more confident in other circumstances.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.560]   Because when you know you have to, because this human is on me, and you just receive
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:26.720]   love and adoration of your wife and your children, then now you go into the workplace and you
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.880]   don't feel like less of a man.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.160]   You don't feel immature.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.160]   You feel stronger.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.960]   And so I think there's a direct causal influence that men with children tend to do more, be
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.400]   more effective than those who don't.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.480]   So children... and then you have a reason for it.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.380]   And your reasons change.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:49.360]   I can track in my own thinking.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:57.080]   I can track the change from being a single man versus being a married father of many.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.880]   And you look at the world differently.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:05.060]   Most of the people that I used to look to for advice when I was single, I don't have
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:07.840]   any interest really in what they have to say anymore.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.160]   It doesn't appeal to me.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.240]   It sounds hollow.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:16.320]   It sounds self-centered often, and it sounds just not particularly useful.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.440]   And a lot of it, and in some cases, it's just flat-out laughable, the stuff that I used
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.440]   to think was effective.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.440]   And I'm not...
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.840]   I don't want to be critical of it.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.540]   After all, probably the advice I gave 10 years ago, probably laughable.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:36.960]   We all are on a process of development and self-improvement, and we all grow in maturity
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.960]   over time.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.280]   And we can't be ashamed of who we were.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.920]   We do the best we know at this point in time.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.300]   We give the best answers, do the best job.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.300]   We can't change that.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.000]   It's just a natural part of life.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.920]   I'm just observing that the advice that I just thought was so wonderful, I no longer
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920]   think that.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.160]   And the causal change has to do with having children, and it changes how you think as
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160]   well.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.760]   I've observed that I'm more conservative than I once was.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:10.560]   I previously was very libertarian, and now I look at many libertarians, not the concept
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.520]   of liberty, but I just look at libertarians, and libertarians tend to turn into goofballs.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.520]   They tend to become libertines and turn into goofballs.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.760]   And the stuff that they do, it's just, "This is not healthy.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.480]   This is not good."
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   And so it's been interesting to watch my political inclinations.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.560]   I've abandoned some of the things that I used to think were true and become more conservative.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.560]   I don't like...
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.560]   I'm not a Republican.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.560]   I guess...
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.560]   I don't know.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.560]   Who knows?
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:37.560]   I don't even...
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.560]   I don't get involved in that stuff.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.480]   But I reflect more conservative values than I once did because I'm a different man than
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:45.360]   I was, and I can see this in many areas.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.560]   So children are motivating.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:52.960]   There's a lot of guys that never even start until they got a reason to, and when you've
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.280]   got children, you often have a reason to.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.000]   And I think that this is something that needs to be countered, kind of brought into the
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.640]   picture.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.440]   I have an ambition to live a more upright life.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.600]   I want to have, when I'm old, I want to have the respect of my children.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.480]   And that changes you as a father.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.960]   If I'm going to have the respect of my children, it means I need to live an authentic, congruous
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   life.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.800]   I can't say one thing and do another because I can't hide anything from them.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.740]   I have to be that person.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:31.800]   And I find myself giving instructions to them, and then I look at my own life and I say,
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.600]   "Joshua, are you doing that?
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   You better do it."
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:40.800]   Otherwise, you better do it, otherwise it ain't going to work.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.840]   And so that's the big benefit.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:50.080]   On the whole, again, I want to be charitable and not pry into your life in any way, but
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:57.880]   I want you to recognize that while children come with costs, those costs are often less
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:05.600]   than you might think, and most of the costs that are real can be adapted to, but they
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.880]   also come with enormous benefits.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:18.660]   And at the end of your life, you are likely to enjoy and appreciate more some of the benefits
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:23.240]   than you will be worried too much about the costs.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240]   I want to close.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.920]   I was going to save this for another podcast, and I may still do that.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:37.200]   But there's this really fascinating passage in the book that I read, and it kind of illustrates
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.080]   something of what I wanted to say.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:50.520]   The book is called Fortune's Children, and it's about Cornelius Vanderbilt and his children.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.480]   And this is a passage without getting too deep into it.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.600]   It's kind of a crazy story because the Vanderbilt fortune was enormous, and then it all fell
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.720]   apart.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.280]   So when old man Vanderbilt died, he left most of his fortune to his son, William.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:15.040]   And at his son's end of his life, this was what he had to say, and I'll just read a short
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.040]   passage here.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:20.160]   "The Commodore had died" – the Commodore was Cornelius Vanderbilt, the founder of the
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:26.440]   fortune – "The Commodore had died, believing that through the occult he would know what
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:37.640]   his heirs were doing.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:41.000]   Perhaps between playing the harp and singing hymns, the activities that he hoped would
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.400]   occupy his time in heaven, or maybe while trying to figure out how a camel might pass
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:50.520]   through the eye of a needle if he was elsewhere, the Commodore noticed what his son had accomplished.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.280]   Not bad for a blatherous kite, he might have said.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.280]   There's something to that boy Bill, after all.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.160]   What did it mean to be the richest man in the world?
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.640]   To William Vanderbilt, it meant very little.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.520]   He was constantly concerned about preserving his wealth and was obsessed with scrutinizing
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.720]   his smallest expense.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.680]   Just after he had invested $50 million in government bonds and was sorting them into
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.880]   stacks on his desk, he called for his private secretary, Isaac Chambers, to come into his
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:18.880]   office.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.080]   "Was I here last Thursday, Mr. Chambers?" he asked.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.640]   "No, for I remember having been up to your house that day."
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.200]   William Vanderbilt picked up a bill from the janitor who supplied him with lunches for
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.200]   $0.40 a day.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:34.640]   "Well, do you know that the janitor has charged me with a lunch on Thursday?"
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:38.380]   He took his pen and made a correction on the bill, eliminating the $0.40 for the lunch
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.680]   he had never eaten, and handed the corrected bill to Mr. Chambers to be paid.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.240]   The sheer magnitude of his fortune, he told Chauncey DePue, gave him no advantages over
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.560]   men of moderate wealth.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.440]   "I have my house, my pictures, and my horses, and so do they.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.840]   I can have a steam yacht if I want to, but it would give me no pleasure, and I don't
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.140]   care for it."
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:00.740]   On another occasion, he spoke of a neighbor, saying, "He isn't worth a hundredth part
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:04.880]   as much as I am, but he has more of the real pleasures of life than I have.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.520]   His house is as comfortable as mine, even if it didn't cost so much.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.800]   His team is about as good as mine, his opera box is next to mine, his health is better
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.440]   than mine, and he will probably outlive me, and he can trust his friends."
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:23.840]   Being the richest person in the world brought him, he said, nothing but anxiety.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:29.120]   He enjoyed having some fine horses that grazed in a pasture he could see from his office
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.160]   in the Grand Central Depot.
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.160]   One friend noted that he was so fond of horses that he "probably would have slept with
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:41.220]   them" and did not, only through fear of the newspapers criticizing his eccentricity.
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.960]   And he was beginning to collect works of art.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.680]   Other than that, there was nothing he wanted.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.060]   His fortune was really nothing but a source of headaches.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:54.000]   He believed that his health had been broken by the burden of managing his father's empire.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.840]   "I feel pretty well," he would tell his doctors, "but can't depend upon myself."
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:03.400]   "What's the use, Sam, of having all this money," he said to his nephew, "if you cannot enjoy
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.400]   it?
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.840]   My wealth is no comfort to me if I have not good health behind it."
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.400]   He asked his nephew if he thought he looked old, as old as the Commodore right before
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.860]   he died.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:17.360]   That was just how he felt, like an 83-year-old.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.800]   By his early 60s, he was tired and worn out.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.360]   "The care of $200 million is too great a load for my brain or back to bear," he confessed
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.360]   to his family.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.400]   "It is enough to kill a man.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.960]   I have no son whom I am willing to afflict with a terrible burden.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:38.680]   There is no pleasure to be got out of it as an offset, no good of any kind.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.240]   I have no real gratification or enjoyment of any sort, more than my neighbor on the
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.120]   next block who is worth only half a million.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.320]   So when I lay down this heavy responsibility, I want my sons to divide it and share the
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.160]   worry which it will cost to keep it."
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:49:00.000]   That was written by a man who was astonishingly wealthy.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.280]   Just recognize children cost money, and they're an investment, but they're not an investment
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.720]   without benefit.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.480]   I don't know what's motivating for you, but having spent a long time doing financial planning,
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.520]   I've always found it a little bit sad when a man arrives at the end of his life and he
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.760]   has lots of money, and he doesn't have children and grandchildren to share it with.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.340]   And again, I want to be clear, many people will not have children.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:32.560]   Throughout society, actually, the percentage of people who don't have children has dropped
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.800]   a little bit, but it's always been lots of people who don't have children, couldn't have
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.320]   children, won't have children.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.640]   That's fine.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.160]   We all live our own life, and they can find other ways of connecting with human beings
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.280]   and being warm and generous and building relationships around them.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:58.000]   But the natural normal pathway is that your family forms the core nucleus of your relationships.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:08.820]   And if you have to choose between two things, being old and rich, really rich and alone,
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:14.360]   as compared to being old and somewhat rich and having, I don't know, two children and
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:23.480]   four grandchildren, or being old and just okay and having four children and 15 grandchildren
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:32.800]   or, you know, seven children and 20 grandchildren, which is more attractive to you?
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.800]   We all choose.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:42.320]   But to me, it seems obvious that children are a form of wealth.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:48.520]   They cost you money to maintain them, bring them up, but on the whole, the benefit is
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.320]   much greater than the cost.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:57.080]   And that's something that has generally only rarely ever been questioned.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:03.200]   I couldn't account for—it's such an obvious thing that in most societies, it's always
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.640]   been accounted for.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:07.280]   It's always been obvious and normal.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:12.560]   Most men in societies that have wealth and power have or want lots of children.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:20.080]   It's only in the last 75 years, I guess, where that's been completely transformed.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:27.160]   And it's been completely transformed by Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and her racist
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:32.760]   plans to take children away from those who were not worthy.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:38.200]   It's been confirmed—it's been the whole like anti-child movement of the predictions
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:43.040]   about global famine and all the stuff, and all of that stuff is so thoroughly debunked.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.120]   And now we're going to face probably the opposite problems, and it's probably not
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:51.380]   going to be as bad as, you know, Malthus—it's probably not going to be as bad and the opposite
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:55.880]   as Malthus predicted it would be if we had too many people.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.720]   But the point is it's a challenge.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.240]   So you have a choice to make in life.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.400]   And all I want to do is to say that if you desire to have children, don't let money
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400]   be the impediment.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.240]   The money can work out.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.000]   You should prepare yourselves.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.400]   Again, I'm not encouraging reckless fecundity.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.240]   I want you to be responsible.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:20.680]   But if you're listening at this point in a podcast, there's not a doubt in my mind
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.800]   that you've already done that.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:28.600]   Nobody who's irresponsible would ever get an hour and 50 minutes deep into this podcast
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.200]   and still be here.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:33.640]   So if you desire to have children, have a baby.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.840]   And if you already have children, I think what makes sense in today's world is maybe
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.680]   have one more.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:45.120]   What I mean by that is there's a big difference between having, I don't know, two children
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.120]   and ten children.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.760]   I don't think everyone should just go through life and have as many babies as they can.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:51.760]   That's not what I'm advocating for.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:59.200]   But in general, if you are the kind of person who has children and you are not sure do we
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.780]   want to have another baby or not, have one more.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.920]   Have one more and then stop.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.720]   And I can't imagine you would regret it.
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720]   I really can't.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.240]   And there's two comments on this that are important.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:17.120]   Comment number one is that historically this is where the growth of society has come from.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:23.760]   With my recent interest in demography, I've learned that in general, again, our reproductive
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.280]   rates are very similar to what they've always been.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:30.960]   A percentage of people that never reproduce, a percentage of people that reproduce with
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:35.720]   one or two children, it's very similar as to historical rates.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:41.840]   What is different and why our populations are declining now is the percentage of people
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:47.240]   who don't have four, five, six, seven children.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:54.280]   That basically people who in days past would have had six today have three.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:59.120]   People who in days past would have had eight today have four and stop.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:03.160]   And that's the difference in the population decline because instead of the family with
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:10.200]   eight, the woman that bears eight offsetting the two women who don't bear any, today the
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:17.720]   woman who in times past might have had eight today has three or four.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.920]   And so there's not the offset to the woman who never has children.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.400]   And that's basically the demographic change.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.640]   Now, I don't think we should try to build our lifestyle upon demography.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:34.720]   You're not going to single-handedly save the world by having 19 children, that's silly.
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:38.600]   But on the whole, we want to build cultures that have more children.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:43.520]   And the big point I would say as a father of five is that the first baby is the hardest,
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.280]   the second baby is hard, and the third and following are not so hard.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:53.920]   And people, they're pretty easy and they bring multiplying fun and joy to your life and they
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.200]   only have marginal costs.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.640]   That your parenting style is different after you have two children because you're no longer
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.120]   evenly matched with two parents, two children, so your parenting style is different.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.680]   The children have playmates, they actually take less time from you.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.440]   Having five children is, once they get past toddler stages, because toddlers are still
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:18.520]   demanding, having five children is, I would say probably in some ways less demanding than
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.160]   having one or two because I don't play with them as much, my wife doesn't play with them
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.160]   as much.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:27.080]   I don't think that makes for a worse childhood.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.920]   We still are very involved and active.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.800]   I don't think that's something that I would need to feel guilty about, it's just different.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.720]   And you have a lot more help.
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.320]   And so now with a toddler and times past with a toddler, it was either me or my wife following
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.720]   the toddler around and keeping the toddler safe, now I have children follow the toddler
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.100]   around and keep the toddler safe.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:50.600]   Not in all circumstances, but if it's five o'clock and we're making dinner and getting
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.120]   everything ready, then I can have the children, say, take turns, watch the toddler, keep the
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.720]   toddler alive.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:59.160]   And with a little bit of supervision from me, it's easier.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:03.840]   And so I think that it seems to me that people who know they don't want to have children,
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.640]   they're pretty clear on that.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:08.660]   People who know they want to have children are also pretty clear on that.
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:14.840]   But it seems to me there's an enormous population of people who appreciate having children,
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.440]   but they feel like they can't responsibly have one more.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.640]   They have two and three would be too much, or we have three, but five would be too much.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.040]   And I don't think that that is something that you should feel.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.280]   I think that you'll be happier at the end of your life with three instead of one, if
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.680]   you were the kind that knows that I value children.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.160]   I think you'd be better off with five instead of three.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.920]   And slightly marginal cost, and a lot more benefit.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:54.440]   Good friend of mine, I have a couple of friends whose children have committed suicide.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:03.120]   And I've often reflected on it since I had a sister that died when she was a teenager.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:04.120]   Not by suicide.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:05.120]   She was sick.
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:06.120]   She had a seizure.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.680]   I've always expected, I kind of still expect, I've always expected that one of my children
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.980]   will die, be due to this.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:18.740]   But there are a few deaths more painful than suicide.
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:26.360]   And I have one friend who had one child, and he committed suicide when he was about 20.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:31.840]   And my friend had poured his life into him.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:37.360]   And when his son committed suicide, it was obviously quite disruptive.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.320]   And he and his wife, they had one son.
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.480]   And I don't know whether they wanted more, I don't know.
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:51.400]   But it just struck me as particularly catastrophic when they had one child who died.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:57.880]   I have another friend who has had eight children, and one child committed suicide.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:06.880]   And I was struck by what a comfort it is to, as you grieve the loss of one child, to have
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.280]   other children.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.080]   And that it's just a different experience.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.840]   Why am I saying this?
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:18.400]   It's probably an obvious point, but we don't plan for death in today's world.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.000]   We just kind of assume that everything is going to work out great.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:28.920]   And I think about, you know, there was a tragic story from Florida recently of parents were
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.720]   down on the beach with their two children, a boy and a girl, and they were digging a
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:38.320]   hole on the beach, and the hole caved in, and I believe their boy was killed, suffocated
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:41.240]   underneath the sand just very quickly.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.240]   Tragic story.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.600]   And I just thought, what a tragedy, how terrible.
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:51.400]   And as a parent, I think we should talk about those things, because it's always going to
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.040]   be tragic.
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.760]   But I just think of my parents.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.020]   My parents had seven children, one died.
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:58:59.020]   That was difficult.
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:01.560]   It was tragic.
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:09.240]   But they continued to enjoy all of the benefits of having six children and 16 grandchildren,
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:13.160]   and what a blessing.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.520]   And it may be the same for you and for me.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:23.520]   So I guess what I'm driving at is, I think if you want to have children and you like
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.460]   children, and you're thinking, "Can I afford it?", just have one more.
[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.980]   One more and see.
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.580]   And you'll know when it's enough, too much.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:38.040]   But if you're just on the fence, let the scale tilt in the favor of one more baby, and recognize
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:43.160]   that to the extent that there is a heavier cost, you'll probably be grateful at the end
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.440]   of your life.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:47.080]   Challenges, we can't know.
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.840]   You got to have your babies when you're young.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.320]   There's a time in life in which you can have babies, and there's a time in life in which
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:55.160]   you can't have babies, and the decisions that you make go far.
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.920]   So I hope that I've struck a proper tone.
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:00.880]   Just to be clear, I don't judge anybody for not having children.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.840]   I don't judge anybody for having few children.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.880]   I don't know any of the reasons why.
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:10.200]   That's between you and your spouse, and God, and your plans.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.200]   That's up to you.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.200]   I don't do that.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:18.120]   But I just wanted to encourage in today's podcast that money is important in having
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:24.720]   children, but it needs to be clearly specified what specifically is important about it.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.000]   What do you need to do?
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.760]   If your financial goals that are keeping you from having babies that you want to have are
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.960]   things that are going to take you more than a year or two to reach, I think you're probably
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:39.600]   better off setting those aside and working your way through with the burden and responsibility
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.080]   of children as compared to not.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.480]   And if you've been trying to think about how to be responsible and not have too many babies,
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:52.080]   I think that you can release yourself from that, and my encouragement would be have one
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.080]   more.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:01:19.320]   Thank you for listening to today's podcast.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:26.600]   I'll see you next time.
