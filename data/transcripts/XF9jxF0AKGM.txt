[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Verse 12 and 13 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, "But as many
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.400]   the will of men, but of God." Now we are looking at this great statement from the angle of
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.880]   what it tells us about ourselves. It reminds us that the Son of God came into this world,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.320]   the Word was made flesh, in order that those who believe on him might be made the children
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.280]   of the sons of God, that they might become the subjects of this new birth, which is not
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.040]   of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God. And that that
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.680]   is the essential truth about the Christian, that he is a new man, that he is a new creation,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.960]   that he is a child of God. And as I am trying to show, there is nothing therefore that is
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.000]   more important than that we should be certain of the fact that we are the children of God,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.240]   that we have undergone this new birth, that we have received this new life, that we have
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.640]   become partakers of the divine nature. And we are applying tests in order to discover
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.800]   that. We have been taking it along the line of the natural and obvious human analogy.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.480]   We have seen that it is essential that we should be clear about our relationship to
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   the Son. We are not only children of God and members of the family of God, but we therefore
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.400]   belong to the same family as the Son of God. So we must be clear about him to as many as
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.920]   we have received him, and we have considered all that that connotes.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.480]   And also then we have gone on to consider our relationship obviously to the Father,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.600]   and we have worked that out in detail. And now we have reached the point at which we
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.720]   are considering our relationship to the Holy Spirit, because the Christian becomes related
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.560]   immediately to the three persons in the Blessed Holy Trinity because the three are one. So
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.480]   we are in a relationship, in a very special relationship, to the Holy Spirit as well as
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.840]   to the Father and to the Son. And that is the matter that is before us immediately at
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.520]   this present time. Now we have already started considering this, and we are testing ourselves
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.760]   in terms of the New Testament teaching concerning the Holy Spirit and the relationship of the
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.680]   believer to him. There are many such tests suggested. You get them particularly in the
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.320]   first epistle of John, but they are scattered about freely in all the New Testament teaching.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   So we have discovered things like this, that we have an awareness of the Spirit within
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:33.360]   us, tested in a very wonderful way even by the experience of desertion, which in an odd
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.760]   way gives us a proof of the reality of the Spirit within us. We have also seen how the
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.520]   Spirit gives us an unction and an anointing which enables us to understand the essential
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.960]   teaching of this book and to detect the antichrists and the false teaching. It is a very good
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   test. You can test your growth in grace, I think, more accurately by the sense of discrimination
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.520]   that you have than perhaps by anything else whatsoever.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.760]   And then we moved on last Sunday morning to consider this great theme of the leading of
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.840]   the Spirit. In Romans 8.14, the apostle tells us that as many as are led by the Spirit of
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.240]   God, they are the children of God. Very well, what does it mean to be led by the Spirit?
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   We have divided it up into general and into particular. I am not going back to the general
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.280]   we dealt with last week, but we began also to consider the particular. And we saw that
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.400]   the Spirit in particular always leads us to this book and always leads us to a spiritual
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.040]   interest in it. Not an intellectual interest, but a spiritual interest. It makes us really
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.720]   know that it is the Word of God, the Word of life and the food of the soul, the heavenly
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   manner. We feel it speaking to us and building us up and establishing us so that we have
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.800]   not just a mechanical, superficial, glib acquaintance with the contents of the books of the Bible,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   but we have an increasing spiritual understanding of it and feel we cannot go on without it.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:27.520]   Then we saw that he likewise leads us to prayer and the various ways in which he teaches us
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.880]   to pray. Sometimes nothing more than groanings which cannot be uttered. But you can add to
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:44.680]   that, put this into your list to make it complete. Praying in the Spirit. When a man is taken
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.840]   hold of and taken out of himself and is amazed at himself and as it were watching himself
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.320]   and listening to himself as he is led out by the Spirit, praying in the Spirit. The
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.920]   thing that is experienced of course in such a remarkable manner during periods of revival
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.520]   and of reawakening. But thank God it is not confined to such periods. And one knows what
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.000]   it is to be taken hold of, as I say, and borne along by the Spirit in a great freedom in
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.720]   prayer which is astonishing to the person praying himself.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.480]   Very well. But now we must move on. I ended last Sunday morning by saying this. I said,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.680]   "Now then, there it is. We've got to leave it at that for this morning, this matter of
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:39.760]   prayer. But next Sunday," I said, "God willing, we will go on to yet another particular way
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.400]   in which the Holy Spirit leads us." And I said, "And that is in the matter of life and
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:55.240]   living and conduct and practice and behaviour." And it is to that that we come this morning.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.300]   Now this is a most important matter. And what perhaps is most important of all about it
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:10.780]   is that we realise its connection with everything that we've been saying hitherto.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:20.440]   We all like to think of and dwell in the realm of experience. We all like this idea of the
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.740]   Spirit dwelling within us and giving us experiences and feelings and sensations and so on. We
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.720]   all like to know something about the way in which the Spirit leads us and guides us and
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.440]   directs us. But the teaching of the New Testament about the leading of the Spirit doesn't stop
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:49.400]   at that. Having told us all that, it goes on to tell us that he equally leads us and
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.240]   guides us in the matter of our conduct and our behaviour, the way in which we actually
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.080]   live. Now here I want to emphasise this amazing
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:10.120]   balance which you always have in the Scripture. And our business is to follow the Scripture
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   and to allow it to lead us in all things. There is nothing more fatal than picking and
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.320]   choosing out of the Scripture. We are all prone to do that. But it's always fatal.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:31.720]   There is a balance in the Scripture. We all like to be able to say, "Lord, Lord." But
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.040]   we remember what our Lord himself has taught us about that, that it's no use saying, "Lord,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.400]   Lord," if you don't do what he tells you, if you don't keep his commandments. We all
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.120]   remember our Lord's picture of the two houses, the one on the rock and one on the sand. And
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.720]   it was uttered, you remember, in order to depict these two types of people, these people
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.280]   who say, "Of course we are Christians and we delight in this. We are always enjoying
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.680]   it, building their house quickly upon the sand, not taking trouble about a foundation.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.560]   But when the test comes, there's nothing left, entirely demolished."
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:19.760]   So, the teaching of the New Testament about the Holy Spirit leads us on to this most practical
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.920]   and ordinary matter. It says, yes, the Holy Spirit can give you wonderful experiences,
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:35.520]   so wonderful that you can scarcely put them into words, but what's your daily life like?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:43.160]   How are you actually living? It's all very well for you to recite your experiences, but
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.880]   what sort of a person are you to live with? What are you like in your ordinary dealings
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.160]   and in the mundane affairs of life?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:01.240]   Now, there I say is this extraordinary matter of the balance of the Scripture. It has both
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:08.000]   these things and it stresses the two with an equal force and with an equal emphasis.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.640]   And what I want to try to do this morning is to show you the all-importance of this
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:22.320]   balance. And in a most extraordinary way, we are provided with a perfect illustration
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.880]   of this very thing by something that's happening in the contemporary world and in the contemporary
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   scene.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:41.800]   I can illustrate perfectly the principle which is taught here in the New Testament by referring,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.960]   and I do so merely by way of illustration. It's not my practice, as I need not say from
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.600]   this pulpit, to preach topical sermons. But when something that's happening at the moment
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.440]   does help to illustrate the truth, well, I take advantage of it. And I trust that as
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.080]   I do so in passing, I may be of some little help and aid to those who may be in considerable
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.240]   perplexity with regard to what they've been reading recently. I refer to the whole question
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:18.200]   of the Quakers and this astonishing report that some of them have produced since last
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.240]   we met together with regard to the whole question of morals. They call it the Quaker approach
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   to sex.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:33.760]   Now, this has caused a great deal of surprise to many people. The things they've said,
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:42.120]   for instance, about sex, premarital, and in the marriage relationship, and the perversions,
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   and so on. The obvious way in which they condone these things and try to say that they're
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.640]   not of necessity wrong, and that if we had a true view of love, we'd take a very different
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   view of all this.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:04.520]   So, this report has caused a large number of people to be filled with surprise that
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.320]   it should come from such a source. I want to try to show you this morning that it shouldn't
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.600]   be surprising at all, that indeed it's just the very thing that you would expect from
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   such a source. And I want to show you the reason why. And it's just there, it becomes
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.760]   an illustration of this great teaching of the New Testament about the Holy Spirit in
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   this very practical manner.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:36.200]   Now, let us be clear about this. The surprise is due to the fact that the Quakers, the Society
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   of Friends, and its members have always been regarded as exceptionally good and moral people,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.960]   and so they are. So they are, so they have been. But there has been a tendency to regard
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.000]   them as the most spiritual people of all. They've encouraged that thought. They don't
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.720]   believe in preaching and teaching, you just sit and you wait for the movement of the Spirit,
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.120]   and so on. And the quietness and the severity of their buildings and everything else. There
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:16.440]   has been this idea that they are, of all people, the most spiritual and the most enlightened.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.520]   And as I say, in the realm of morals and ethics and behavior, they've always been exceptionally
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.720]   honest people, and so on. And that is why people have this week been surprised that
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.360]   a report like this should come from such people and from such a source.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.560]   Now, I want to try to show you, as I say, that we should not be a bit surprised at this,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:50.600]   that this kind of thing is really the inevitable result of their whole position and outlook.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.800]   Let me show you what I mean. What is the essence of their teaching? Well, you remember that
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:05.760]   Quakerism is something that began 300 years ago in the 17th century. Started by a man
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:13.200]   called George Fox, who was a most remarkable man. Undoubtedly a very fine, unusually fine
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:21.640]   Christian man, and a man I wouldn't hesitate to say was filled with the Spirit. But in
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:28.480]   his original teaching there were certain wrong tendencies, and they very soon became exaggerated
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:35.040]   and aggravated. And when you came to the next century, the thing became quite obvious, and
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   it's continued obvious ever since. Now, what was their teaching? Well, the teaching
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.520]   in its essence is this. They put their emphasis upon what is called the inner light, or if
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:55.080]   you prefer it, the Christ within you. That is where the Quakers differed from the other
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   Puritans of the 17th century. That is how they have differed from everybody else ever
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.480]   since. They didn't believe, as I say, in chapels and churches and preaching services
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.720]   and so on, and exposition of truth. They don't have sacraments, neither the Lord's Supper
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.560]   nor baptism. Why not? Well, they say, all this doesn't matter. Indeed, they say it
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.400]   can be very misleading. They say, look at all those people going to their churches and
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.800]   to their chapels. They're just traditionalists. They've been taught certain things and they
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   repeat them like parrots, but what do they mean to them? Has that thing entered into
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.760]   their life? Is it a power in their living? Of course it isn't, they said. Those people
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.000]   have got the letter and they've got nothing else, a dead letter. They know nothing about
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.040]   the life of the Spirit, but they said the essence of Christianity is that it's a life,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.160]   it's a spirit. And they said this is the thing that has been missed by the Church throughout
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   the centuries, and which they claimed that they'd rediscovered and recaptured. So they
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.960]   put all their emphasis upon this inner life, this inner witness, Christ within you. So
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.360]   you see, you don't speak in a meeting until you're moved to do so. You may gather together
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.000]   in a meeting and not a word may be said because nobody's been moved. They say, what right
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.560]   have you to speak unless you've had this definite moving and leading of the Spirit?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.400]   So you see, their teaching is really very, very germane to this matter that we are considering
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:37.840]   together. But, and this is the serious point, while a man like George Fox and some of the
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:48.040]   very originators still believed in the Bible and read it, the tendency soon came in, and
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.560]   I say it's their incipient, in George Fox himself, the tendency came in to say that
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:02.320]   the Bible, after all, really wasn't very necessary. If you've got this inner light,
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   this inner illumination, and if God through the Spirit speaks to you in that way, and
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:13.160]   the Christ within, well, what need is there of a Bible? You're getting a direct revelation.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.560]   You're getting a direct leading. You don't need this external, this objective treatment
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:26.080]   of the truth. So, more and more, they put less and less emphasis upon the Word of God
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.240]   and its teaching, and more and more upon this direct illumination. They would argue with
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.720]   people who expounded the Scriptures, they'd say, I don't care what you say, I know, it's
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   been revealed to me, it's come to me, the light has dawned upon me. So they put this
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:48.360]   inner experience over against the Word. And as I say, as the years pass, and by when you
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.000]   come to the next century, there were those of them who said that the Bible isn't necessary
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.280]   at all. But while all haven't gone to that extreme, their essential position by today
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:09.520]   is just this, that the Bible is not really necessary. Its chief value is that you have
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:16.920]   this portrait of Jesus, whom they would say had the inner light more than anybody else.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   And the result is that by today, the Quakers are in a position which we mustn't hesitate
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.280]   to say is far removed from that of the Christian position.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:39.480]   Now, let us see what this means, therefore. Well, it means this, you see, that the moment
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:48.040]   you separate the Spirit from the Word, the teaching of his own Word, you are courting
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:54.600]   disaster and you are certainly eventually going to land in trouble. That's precisely
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.480]   what they've done. They have emphasized the Spirit only and have discounted the Word.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.360]   I know that on the other hand there are people who put all their emphasis upon the Word and
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.520]   don't like any talk about the Spirit. They are equally wrong. But we are dealing at the
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:19.400]   moment with this particular error that characterizes the Quakers in and of themselves.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:26.760]   So you see, they have found themselves in this position, that they are not tied or governed
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:34.320]   by the Bible at all. It's by this inner light, this illumination, it's what they
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.560]   call the Christ within. It's the way that your mind is led out, so that more and more
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.080]   they have become increasingly philosophical.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.560]   Now what has this led to? Well, it's led to certain things which I say were quite inevitable.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.160]   One is that they have gone hopelessly astray in their doctrine. Most of them by now are
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   nothing but Unitarians. They no longer believe in the deity of Christ. He was just a great
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.880]   man, a great religious moral teacher, one who was exceptionally endowed with this inner
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.480]   light and illumination. And therefore we can benefit by reading about him and by trying
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.520]   to follow him.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.560]   They have gone wrong on the person of Christ. They have obviously gone wrong, therefore,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   upon his work, his atoning death upon the cross. They don't believe in it. They don't
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.080]   even see any need of it. Believing as they do that this inner light is in everybody,
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.600]   if they but realized it, there's no need for rebirth. There is no need for Christ to
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.160]   bear the punishment of my sins and to die upon the cross, because they don't recognize
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:48.520]   sin as such. God is love to them, and God has put this spark in everybody, and all that's
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.480]   needed is to kindle it into flame. And you do that by following the teaching and by becoming
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.960]   passive and just stopping all thought and listening. And the light will come and the
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.000]   voice, as it were, will begin to speak and you'll be led out into the truth. So they
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.960]   deny the doctrine of the atonement, and it's not surprising they don't have the sacrament
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.640]   of the Lord's Supper, therefore, and they don't have baptism. All that is entirely
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:22.160]   gone. All that is needed is to give this spark that is in us, this light that is already
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.520]   there, an opportunity to do its own work within us. So that when you come to judge them from
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:37.400]   the standpoint of the biblical teaching and orthodox Christianity, they are complete deniers
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   of the truth. Now that's what people don't realize, you see. In these evil days in which
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.600]   we find ourselves, the argument is, "But they're such good people. Look at the good
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.440]   works they do. Aren't they Christ-like? Look at the way they suffer. Look at the things
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   they've organized during wars, ambulance units, and the work they've done with refugees
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.000]   and with starvation. Look at their good works." Well, of course, the moment you say that,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.640]   you're saying that you are not a Christian either, because you're suggesting that what
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.400]   makes a man a Christian is his good works. And you have no atonement, and you don't
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.200]   need any new birth. That's the whole fantasy. But I'm trying to show you that the moment
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.000]   you say that the Spirit alone is enough, and you don't need the Word and its teaching,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.720]   inevitably you must go astray in your doctrine. And for years that has been the truth concerning
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:37.640]   them. They are nothing, I suggest, but sheer unitarians. But we must go further, and this
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:44.360]   is what now is becoming so interesting and so plain and so obvious. The next step is
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:52.480]   that you begin to go wrong in your practice. You can't separate these things. You cannot
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:01.920]   separate doctrine and practice. "Evil communications corrupt good manners," says the Apostle Paul.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.360]   That's why he was fighting with the Corinthians over the doctrine of the literal, physical
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.160]   resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. They were beginning to listen to these teachers
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.040]   who said, "It doesn't matter whether he arose literally from the grave or not. What's it
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.080]   matter? We've got his Spirit still. We've got his teaching. What's this matter?" It
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:26.040]   does matter, says Paul. If Christ be not risen from the dead, you are yet in your sins. Our
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   preaching has been vain. It's been wrong. It's been false. You are yet in your sins.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.200]   He says, "This is absolutely necessary." Don't you say that doctrine doesn't matter, says
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:45.280]   Paul? "Evil communications corrupt good manners." Ungodliness always leads to unrighteousness.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.000]   And the whole world is showing that at the present time. But, and this is what's most
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.760]   interesting, that these people who have always been praised for their ethical, moral living,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:01.280]   they at last are beginning to show that evil communications corrupt good manners. For now,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.880]   they are telling us in this teaching. I know that it isn't true of all of them, but these
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.680]   are considered some of their best leaders who have issued this report. They've gone
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:24.640]   wrong, I say, in their practice. They are definitely allowing and condoning premarital
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:36.760]   experiences of sex. They are trying to justify, in certain circumstances, adultery. And they
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.680]   are putting up a defense of homosexuality. I don't apologize for mentioning these things
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.320]   from the pulpit. You're reading them in your papers. You're hearing it on your televisions.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.760]   It's time the Christian church spoke about these matters. And this, to me, is the whole
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.920]   answer. "What's wrong with all this?" you say. Well, what is wrong in the first instance
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:10.080]   is this, that on the three points, they are plainly and blatantly and openly denying biblical
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:19.480]   teaching. The Bible is perfectly clear on these three points. It condemns the three,
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:25.360]   so that they don't hesitate to contradict the biblical teaching. Where does the biblical
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   teaching come from? It comes from God. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.680]   and is profitable for doctrine and reproof and instruction in righteousness, says the
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.400]   apostle Paul to Timothy in 2 Timothy 3.16, which we read at the beginning. And that is
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.600]   the view which all the apostles took of the Old Testament. It is the view our Lord himself
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.320]   took. He had believed it all. He describes it as the word of God, and he says it cannot
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:03.080]   be broken. And it is that very teaching which condemns fornication, condemns adultery, condemns
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:11.160]   these perversions. And as you know, adultery and the perversions were punished by death,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.320]   and by nothing short of death. But these people, they don't hesitate to say that all this is
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:23.360]   wrong, that all this is antiquated. We're behind the times with modern ideas and modern
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   thinking and modern understanding. This is wrong, they say. And we must deliver the people
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.200]   from it. It's legalism, they say. It's not love. It's putting chastity in the place of
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.600]   love, and so on. Well, now, the first answer is, as I'm trying to show you, that it's a
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:49.560]   blank, blatant denial of the plain, explicit, oft-repeated biblical teaching with respect
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.600]   to all these matters. But I do trust that you're following me in the principle. They've
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.560]   arrived in this position for this one reason, that they are going on what they call the
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:08.200]   inner light only, and not checking it by the word. They're putting all the emphasis on
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.400]   one and not keeping the balance and putting the equal emphasis upon the other. So, you
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.880]   see, you trust your own feeling, your own understanding, your own enlightenment, more
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.680]   than you do the objective word of God.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.640]   No, it's not our business this morning to go into any defense of the Bible and its teaching
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.440]   on these matters, although that wouldn't be at all difficult. Why does the Bible teach
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   these things are wrong? Well, it teaches them because it has a view of man, that man's not
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.880]   just an animal, that he's made in the image of God, that man has got a mind and he's meant
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   to govern and discipline and restrain himself, that he is not some creature living in the
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.720]   farmyard, still less in the jungle, that the thing that differentiates a man from an animal
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   is that a man can exercise control and restraint. It bases it upon the dignity of man's being.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.040]   It says that God ordained marriage, man and woman, these two angels be made one flesh.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.560]   God ordained marriage. It's the fundamental unit. It's the only thing that safeguards the
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:15.240]   sanctity of the family and the interests of children and so on.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:21.360]   And with regard to your perversion, surely no argument is necessary. Nature itself cries
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.760]   out in protest that the thing is wrong, that it's a violation of what you see right through
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:34.120]   the whole realm of nature. And yet these people are justifying it. But to us the serious matter
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.960]   is that they're brushing aside the word of God. There's no objective standard. A committee
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.560]   of enlightened people sit together and they wait for the leading. And there it is, and
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.840]   therefore it must be right. You can't check it by anything. They don't know that there
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.640]   are evil spirits and that you must prove and try and test the spirits, whether they be
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:03.520]   of God or whether they're not. That's nothing to them. Modern enlightenment, modern understanding.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:12.000]   So there we find them violating in this blatant and arrogant manner the plain and varnished
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.160]   teaching of the Scripture. But you see it doesn't stop at that. It leads to the fact
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:26.360]   that they have an entirely wrong view of love. It's put all in terms of love, of course,
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:33.400]   this wonderful thing that the ordinary person amongst us doesn't understand. You've got
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.560]   to be one of these perverts to understand love. You've got to be one of these esoteric
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:44.240]   literary people and then you'll have this beautiful notion of love which allows you
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.760]   to trample upon all the sanctities. And they put it all, I say, in terms of love, that
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.880]   we are not aware of the beauty of all this, of these relationships.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:04.560]   Well, now, there's a very simple answer to all this. The Bible talks about three kinds
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:12.200]   of love, if you like, putting love in inverted commas. One of them it calls Eros, which is
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:18.360]   animal, physical. It's in all of us, of course. God's put it there. There's nothing wrong
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:27.280]   in it in and of itself. But then there's another one which rises to a higher level,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:34.400]   the kind of love which we normally denote as friendship, filial love. You'll find all
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:42.000]   that in the last chapter of John's Gospel. You remember the questions put to Peter after
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.680]   his betrayal and when they were there by the lakeside. "Dost thou love me more than these?"
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.360]   And Peter replies, "I'm very fond of you." But the question was not was he fond,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.400]   did he really love. Well, now, there is that kind of love, that second one. It's not
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:03.240]   so physical and primitive and elemental, but it's a kind of soulish attachment and understanding
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.560]   of one another. But the New Testament goes on and it invents a new word to describe love
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:16.000]   in terms of God's love to men and the love that men become capable of in return to God.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.720]   And this is something that's in a different realm altogether. This isn't physical. This
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:31.960]   is the love of God himself, full of benignity, full of purity, full of holiness, God's holy
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:37.120]   love to men. Now, you see, the writers of the New Testament were in difficulties when
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.840]   they came to try to describe this. They hadn't a term. And so you will find that a man like
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.240]   the great apostle Paul, when he's dealing with this, has to write the whole of that
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   thirteenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians. He wanted to convey the notion
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.920]   to these people. He says, "Look here, when I talk about love, I'm not thinking of that
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:01.840]   Eros of yours, nor even of this other love. I'm telling you this great love of God which
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.880]   must be in your hearts, because if you haven't got this, it doesn't matter what you are.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.460]   You may speak with the tongue of men and of angels. You may do good works and you may
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:15.480]   have faith that you could remove mountains. It's all of no value unless you have this."
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.400]   So what is this? Well, it isn't like that, he says. It doesn't vaunt itself. It doesn't
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.080]   boast. It isn't self-centered, and so on. What is it like? Then he begins to tell you
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:32.920]   something about it. But he has to do all that because of the inadequacy of language. And
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.440]   it's just there, it seems to me, that we have the whole tragedy of these people at
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:45.920]   the present time. They are trying to take that lowest form, that Eros, and elevating
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.360]   it into the supreme position. They really, I say, don't understand the biblical teaching
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.320]   about love. That's another consequence of turning your back upon the Bible and trusting
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.840]   to some inner illumination. You are now trying to justify everything in terms of your own
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:07.200]   understanding instead of bringing it into the light of this great and glorious teaching
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:16.800]   about love. And so, you see, in the end they become wrong even about chastity. It is not
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.720]   true to say that the Christian church has put chastity before love. I know that there
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.400]   may have been people who have done that. There have been legalistic people in the Christian
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:31.880]   church, falsely imagining themselves to be true Puritans, and there have been sheer legalists.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.000]   I don't think they were Christians at all. They were just moralists. But speaking generally,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   the church has never done this. The church has emphasized chastity. Why? Well, for this
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:51.960]   reason, that it is a test of love. You tell the difference between Eros and Agape ultimately
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:59.360]   by the test of chastity. But you see, these foolish people put them as opposites. They
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.920]   contrast law and love. They say they are opposites. I mustn't go back over this. We dealt with
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:10.640]   it at great length before Christmas in dealing with verse 17. The law was given by Moses,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.600]   but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. But the most fatal thing of all, as I tried
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.400]   to show, was to put them as opposites. They are not. They go together. And what the New
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:27.880]   Testament says is this, that if the love that you talk about is not chaste, well, then it
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:33.720]   isn't love. It's Eros. Now let me give you my authority for saying
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:40.800]   this. The Apostle Paul has put it in the epistle to the Romans in chapter 13 and in verse 10,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.560]   where he deals with this whole matter. He has been handling high doctrine. He has now
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:51.880]   come down to the practicalities of daily life and living. And listen to him. This is how
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.840]   he puts it. He is telling these people to obey the powers that be. He says we need to
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:03.680]   be subject not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For this cause pay ye tribute
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.400]   also. He says you mustn't say we are enlightened people, we are Christians, we are no longer
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.600]   subject to the law of the land, we needn't pay our taxes, we needn't be subservient to
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.920]   the powers that be. That's quite wrong, he says. Christianity isn't lawlessness. Christianity
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.160]   is not every man a law unto himself. Well, what is it? Well, listen. For this cause pay
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.600]   ye tribute also. Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:38.080]   to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour. O no man anything but to love
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:47.040]   one another. For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. Don't put law and love
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   as contrasts. You mustn't talk about love unless you are keeping the law. He that loveth
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.880]   another hath fulfilled the law. For this thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.920]   kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.320]   and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:21.440]   thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour. Therefore
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:29.080]   love is the fulfilment of the law. And yet these people come up and say, "Oh, you mustn't
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.440]   put chastity in the supreme position. Love must go there." Love and chastity are opposites,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:41.920]   you see. Love and law have become opposites by now. The answer is that love is the fulfilling
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:49.200]   of the law. And if what people call love today doesn't fulfil the law, it is not love. It
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:58.520]   is lust. It is eros. And they have lost the distinction between eros and agape. And of
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:07.240]   course this becomes perfectly obvious the moment that you work it out in practice. Love
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:16.000]   willeth no ill to its neighbour. Never, it never does that. It is always concerned about
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.720]   the good of the neighbour. And that is something that has got to be worked out in detail.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   When we have this true love of which the Bible speaks in our hearts, when the love of God
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:40.520]   is shed abroad in our hearts, this is what happens. We love ourselves truly, and we love
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:46.280]   others truly. The first and the greatest commandment is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.840]   all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength." The second is
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:58.400]   likened to it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." That's a good guess. That's
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:06.480]   the way. You love yourself. You love yourself as a creature of God, not as what you are,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.120]   but as a child of God. And you love your neighbour as yourself. You never work any ill to your
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.280]   neighbour therefore. You are always considering your neighbour. You are not considering your
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:23.120]   own desire only. You are not considering your own lust only, and the gratification. You
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.760]   consider the consequences to your neighbour. You respect your neighbour. And whatever you
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.800]   may desire, you will curb it and crush it, rather than do any harm to your neighbour.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:41.640]   But that's the very thing that seems to me to be denied at the present time. And it's
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.160]   all being denied in the name of love.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.880]   Well now, you see, my friends, I've taken you through all this, much as I dislike doing
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:57.600]   so, in order that I might illustrate this great theme that is here before us. There
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:06.640]   is nothing which is more fatal than to separate the spirit from the word. That's been the
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:12.680]   whole tragedy of the Quakers from beginning to end. It led to certain excesses at the
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.480]   very beginning. It has continued to do so. And now we've got it in this most refined,
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:23.920]   intellectual, sophisticated manner, but it's revealed the cloven hoof. Their position,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.960]   I say, is nothing but the logical and the inevitable outcome of this fatal dichotomy
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   which they've introduced between the spirit and the word. Where has the word come from?
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.520]   It is the spirit who has indicted it.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:46.000]   "Prophecy," says Peter in his second epistle in chapter one, "no word of prophecy in ancient
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.120]   time came by the will of men." It's not of any private interpretation. It isn't what
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.480]   a man thinks. That's his whole definition of scripture. Scripture is not what a man
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:03.560]   thinks. It's not a man allowing his mind to be led somehow vaguely. Not at all. Holy
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost gave them the revelation,
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.160]   he guided them in the recording and in the writing of it. And here we have it in an objective
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   manner before our eyes. So the apostle says to Timothy, "Pay great attention to this.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   Check everything he says by it. The scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   All scripture is given by inspiration of God, God breathed. Profitable for doctrine, for
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.360]   reproof. You won't know your doctrine anywhere else. You can't work out your doctrine. It
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   isn't what you and I think about the Lord Jesus Christ that matters. It's what's been
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:54.440]   revealed about him. But silly people today are saying, "I admire Jesus. I like his teaching.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.840]   I'm going to follow him and that makes me a Christian." Well, all right, let them say
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.680]   so, but that isn't what the Bible says about him. You'll never get hold of doctrine unless
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.040]   you submit yourself to this book. Here is the repository of doctrine. We know nothing
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.960]   about doctrine apart from this. Here alone are we given the truth. I may get wonderful
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.760]   ideas. Yes, but I know something of church history. I see how the heretics have gone
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   astray. I see how men have fallen into error, even good men, because they began to listen
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.400]   to some inner light instead of checking it by the word of God. Why did God ever give
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:33.080]   us the scriptures? It was in order that we might be safeguarded against the wiles of
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:39.520]   the devil, that we might be safeguarded against our own beautiful thoughts. Oh, the whole
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:46.640]   of church history is strewn with the tragedies which have followed when men have divided
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.920]   the word from the spirit and have ignored the word and said, "It doesn't matter. I've
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:58.480]   had this light. I've had this illumination." I think I have referred before from this pulpit
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:06.080]   to a book written back about twenty-five years ago on this whole theme. Its original title
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:15.160]   was Group Movements and Experiments in Guidance by Ray Strachey, who incidentally was one
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:23.920]   of the family of Mrs. Hannah Whittle Smith and her husband who started the Keswick movement.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.720]   In this book she just gives an account of what you may call freak religious movements
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:37.280]   in America in the nineteenth century. They are all factual, they are all strictly historical.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.320]   Various communities arose. How? Well, a man stood up and said that he had been given some
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:49.000]   extraordinary light. Now I want to show you the ridiculous extremes to which these things
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.560]   can go. This is a literal, solemn, actual fact. There was a community known as the Oneida
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:05.920]   community, founded and run by a certain man. He had quite a considerable following. It
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:13.560]   was quite a considerable community. But this is the point which they reached. This man
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   eventually claimed that he was so filled with this light and with the spirit that it actually
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:26.640]   radiated from his body. And the end of the teaching was that if you found difficulties
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.960]   in obtaining this blessing and entering into the same experience, you could get your experience
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:43.600]   by making physical contact with him. And the end was that men and women would lie in the
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:51.440]   same bed with this man to receive the blessing that emanated and came out and radiated in
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:57.160]   this way from his literal physical body. Well, you may say that is fantastic. Yes, but you
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:05.320]   know that man started as quite an orthodox believer, as the Quakers did. But more and
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.360]   more, you see, he departed from the Word. He was not to be led by the Word. He was having
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.680]   this direct illumination. And so you land in a position which is obvious to anybody
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:23.040]   who knows the elements of the Bible, is patently not only wrong and sinful but even ridiculous
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.960]   in addition. Now that is only one example I have given you. There have been many others.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.840]   There have been movements like this throughout the centuries. All these movements arise and
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:42.680]   flourish and end in disaster and scandal simply because they put the whole of their emphasis
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:52.040]   upon some inner experience and ignore the Word. If you keep true to the Word, you cannot
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:57.360]   follow cults like that. All the cults do the same thing. But you cannot if you keep true
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.240]   to the Word. The Word will pull you up. It will condemn you. It will say, "Look here,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.520]   the Word says thou shalt not this, thou shalt not that." Therefore, whatever light you
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:13.400]   claim to have, it is not of God, it is of the devil. And so you have this most intellectual
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:22.960]   and ethical and moral society now at long last, showing the inevitable end at which
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:29.640]   you arrive when you make this artificial division. And we have them in this appalling position
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:45.680]   of encouraging people today to disobey the Word of God, to break God's holy commandments.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:52.800]   And the end of all that will be not only the demoralization of society, it will be the
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:01.600]   collapse of society, even politically, and in every other respect. Now, my friends, this
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.520]   is not meant to have been an attack upon the Quakers. They are only an illustration. They
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:11.240]   have said it themselves in public, so I am entitled to reply in public, but I am not
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:18.760]   interested in Quakerism. What I am interested in is this, that anybody should have put all
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.240]   the emphasis on what I have been saying up until this Sunday about the leading of the
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:30.600]   Spirit, and should begin to object and to retract and dislike it when I am going on
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:41.240]   to say that the Spirit also guides us in our morals, in our practical daily life and living,
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.880]   and that the Scriptures teach us that it does not matter how much you may say you know your
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.280]   Scriptures, nor what wonderful light you have got if you are living a life of sin. "He
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   that saith, I know him, and walketh in darkness, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:11.680]   Thank God for the balance of the Scriptures, the Spirit and the Word, the Spirit on the
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:21.080]   Word, the Spirit through the Word. And let us keep our minds and hearts open to it as
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:26.920]   a whole, omitting nothing. Amen.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.040]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
