[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.880]   talk about one of my favorite favorite subjects and that's paying for our
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.520]   children's college education through a 529 plan. Now the 529 plan is an
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.360]   excellent idea because you contribute after-tax money and it gets to compound
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.880]   tax-free and when you withdraw the money for qualified educational expenses you
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.400]   don't have to pay any tax or penalty or anything whatsoever. So when you're saving
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.920]   and investing your money you might as well take advantage of every single plan
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.120]   out there that reduces your potential tax liability. 401k and IRA and Roth IRA
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   for your retirement, 529 plan for your kids college education. Sounds simple
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.560]   enough. And one of the greatest things to come out of the coronavirus induced
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.720]   market meltdown is our ability to contribute more to our retirement
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.400]   accounts and to our 529 plans. So I personally was able to contribute an
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.000]   extra $30,000 in March 2020 when the market was melting down because I
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.360]   figured you know what it's gonna be for the next 18 years for my daughter so I
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.160]   have no problems investing with that real time frame. Whereas investing my
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.960]   hard-earned precious cash into a taxable account that was a much much dicier
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.440]   proposition and I still went through I still invested a decent chunk of change
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.200]   but I'm out I'm out at $2,850, $2,900, $2,930 on the S&P 500. I couldn't hold on to
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.040]   that money that I inputted into the market in March because I'm just afraid
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.520]   of a relapse. But with a 529 plan it's like 18 years come on 18 years I think
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.220]   things will be okay. But what I realized is that I ended up super funding my
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.040]   daughter's 529 plan. I didn't plan to do that before the pandemic hit. I was like
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   okay I'm gonna contribute $15,000 a year and then just keep it that way because
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.200]   we have just gone through a 10-year bull market and things were dicey. So if you
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.240]   look at all my previous posts, a lot of my previous podcasts, I'm just kind of a
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.160]   more conservative guy when it comes to the stock market and I have been for the
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.240]   past couple years. Now once the markets started melting down I was like alright
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.760]   let's start contributing so I super funded it with $75,000 and that's when I
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.920]   realized hmm maybe I contributed too much to my daughter's 529 plan because
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.600]   my son is three times older than my daughter but he only has about 90% more.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   So let's talk about what is the appropriate amount to contribute to your
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.280]   529 plan by age. And to get to this answer we need to figure out what the
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   endgame is. What is the cost of college going to be like in the future? Well right
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.240]   now for the average tuition and fees for 2020, public in-state is about $10,116.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.400]   Public out-of-state is about $22,600 and for private schools the cost is about
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   $37,000. That's a lot of money folks and the one thing we should all recognize is
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.200]   that the value of a college education has taken a step down. It has devalued
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.120]   post the pandemic, post the lockdowns because everything is being done online
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.400]   right now you know through Zoom, WebEx or whatever and everything online is
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.840]   already free. So if we're doing everything online with college education
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   and everything online is already free what the heck is a parent supposed to do?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   Still spend the same amount of money for that college degree? No I don't
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.400]   think so because most of college I would say 60 to 70 to 80 percent of college
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   okay 80% of college is about the experience. It's about getting to know
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.400]   great connections and friends and going out to party and doing stupid things and
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   learning from your mistakes. It's that whole experience that you're going to
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.080]   college for. The educational component of college is you know it's probably like
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.440]   20%. You know you're going there to learn, listen, try to build on your degree so
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.040]   maybe you can get a master's maybe I don't know or you're just trying to
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   learn on the things that you want to become an expert in so that you can get
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.000]   a better job in a relevant field in the future. Let's be frank I think most of us
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.120]   do not remember more than 10% of what we learned in college. At least I don't and
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.920]   it also doesn't make sense to still spend four or five years getting your
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.960]   college degree because hello the internet, technology, you don't have to go
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.560]   into the Dewey Decimal System and you know research books and check them out
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.920]   and spend tens of hours writing a paper. You can do things at least twice as fast
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.680]   now versus before the internet. So think about the way things are. The price of
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.160]   college should be declining but it's probably not going to be because of you
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.360]   know old inertia and greed and so forth and the duration it takes to get a
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   college degree. Four to five years it's probably not going to decline either
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.520]   because it is against what colleges want and they so long as we demand going to
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.280]   college they're going to dictate terms. So I've gone ahead and created a
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.560]   recommended five to nine plan amounts by age and it's in a handy-dandy chart. Four
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.240]   columns. First column is your age. The second column is called low or alpha. The
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   third column is called medium or Bravo and the fourth column is called high or
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.120]   coca. Now these columns represent how much you should save by age depending on
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.720]   your circumstances and beliefs. For the low column or alpha column, alpha sounds
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   better doesn't it? Someone was saying oh I'm only in the low column I feel bad.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.600]   Well that's just not the point. The point is if you're on any of the columns for
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   sure that's pretty good because it hopefully is jiving with your beliefs
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.400]   about college education and your children. So let's look at the age 18
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.800]   amounts for each column. So at age 18 the low alpha column 95,000 to 100,000.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   Your goal is to accumulate about $100,000 by the time your son or
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   daughter turns 18. In the medium column, the Bravo column, you should try to
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.320]   accumulate about $500,000 and in the high-end column or the coca column a
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.720]   million dollars. A million dollars sounds crazy. You're creating five to nine plan
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.640]   millionaires. We talked about this before but let's be frank there are parents out
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.040]   there who are willing to spend $800,000 to over a million dollars for their
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.560]   child's education. Personally I would rather just maybe I don't know but I
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   think I would rather just set up a trust and create that fund for my child and
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.920]   have him or her go to public school and save a lot of money. And if I was a child
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.000]   and my parents said we will give you a million dollars if you go to public
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.720]   school for grade school and go to community college or a public school for
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.080]   college and I would say hell yeah give me the money give me the million dollars
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.880]   and I can start a business start a family do whatever I want awesome but
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   you know everybody has different opinions and that's totally fine. So
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.680]   let's talk about the low column the alpha column. It assumes that you just
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.120]   contribute $5,000 per year with 0% growth to account for several bear
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.160]   markets during the initial 18 years. The goal is to have saved right $100,000 by
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.800]   18 and I think that should be decent. Here are some bullet points for those
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.320]   who might want to follow the low column. Parents who have older children already
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   you know they're 10 plus and you know you just can't save as much. Look I don't
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.920]   want to have you feel bad because you don't have the right amount based on
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.880]   what I'm recommending. I'm just saying like if you have a 15 year old and you
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   didn't continuously save since he or she was zero well you're gonna be kind of
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.320]   behind. So here at the low column you have older children. To parents who don't
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.240]   strongly believe in the value of a college education you believe that the
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.840]   college education is declining in value might be free one day and you won't have
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.220]   to pay such a crazy crazy amount. Your child will go to a public university or
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.240]   community college to your college or potentially no college. Most of Americans
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.760]   don't have a college education and this is important to realize for those who
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.960]   have just been thinking about college all their lives you're not the majority.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.120]   Fourth point maybe your child is a genius or a talented athlete and will
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   get tuition subsidies from universities. The next point maybe you have a family
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.640]   business and the child likes your family business and you can just easily hire
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.280]   him or her into the family business. And then finally you as parents may have
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.200]   many children and you simply cannot fully fund all their five to nine plans
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.240]   but you want to fund them enough so that they don't graduate with massive massive
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.520]   amounts of debt and feel bitter at life. Let's move on to the next column the
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.440]   medium column or the Bravo column. The Bravo column assumes a 15,000 annual
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.560]   contribution every year until 18 with a 6.2% compound annual return. I came up
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   with 15,000 because that is the gift tax exemption amount per person so hopefully
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.240]   one of you guys can give 15,000 every year. And how did I get to 6.2%?
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.040]   Well it's kind of back of the envelope calculation because I want the medium
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.680]   column to get to about 500,000 for college by the time your son or daughter
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.560]   turns 18. So to get to $500,000 with a $15,000 annual contribution you've got to
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.280]   earn 6.2% a year and that's reasonable. Think about how much stocks have
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.120]   returned since 1926 it's about 8 to 10 percent. Think about how much bonds
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.840]   returned since then it's about 4 to 6 percent and the returns are going to get
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.160]   smaller and smaller as you get to 18 hopefully because you want to spend that
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.200]   money and not lose that money. So 6.2% I think it's reasonable. It's up to you to
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.400]   make the assumptions but I think it's reasonable. So who should follow the
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.800]   Bravo column? Well parents who have a newborn or children under three seems
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:21.280]   decent. You've got 18 years, 15 to 18 years to save and invest. Parents who
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.320]   only plan to have one or two children so not that many children. Parents who
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.680]   believe a college education is still valuable although you know you might
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.040]   realize it's not as valuable as it once was. Your child is of average
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.400]   intelligence and average athletic ability therefore your child is probably
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.440]   not going to get any grants or scholarships. How about parents who want
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.480]   to hedge against a continued rapid increase in college tuition? College
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.400]   tuition has been rising by about say 4 to 5 percent a year. Some higher, some
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.960]   lower but around 4 to 5 percent. You would think that the majority of schools
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:04.440]   would freeze their tuition for the 2021 school year but so far I've only heard
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   my alma mater the College of William & Mary freeze their tuition. Good for them
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   and I hope other colleges and universities do the same especially
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.440]   those with massive massive endowments. Next, parents also have a family
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.080]   business. Why not hire your kid especially if he or she likes the family
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.160]   business? And finally parents who tend to be more financially conservative. In
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.040]   general it's a good idea to end up with a little bit too much money rather than
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.280]   a little bit too little but either way a little bit a little bit on each side is
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   not bad so it's better to have too much money rather than too little money.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.760]   Moving on to the final column, the high column, the COCA column. This assumes a
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.040]   30,000 annual contribution every year until 18 with a 7% compound annual
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.960]   return. So you get a double whammy here. Two people contributing $15,000 and a
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   higher rate of return. 7% it feels a little bit aggressive nowadays
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.720]   especially after a long bull market and especially we saw a loss decade from the
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.360]   year 2000 to 2010 but these are my assumptions so that parents can get to
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.480]   1 million dollars by the time the child is 18. So again a little bit back of the
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   envelope to get to that 7% but a million dollars is that target amount and it
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.120]   sounds crazy but you know from reading my previous posts and perhaps listening
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   to my previous podcast that one can easily spend $800,000 on grade school
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.320]   education from kindergarten through 12th grade and then for private school and
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   everything and then you add on inflation and rising costs and the opportunity
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.760]   costs of not investing your funds in profitable investments and yeah $1
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.820]   million doesn't sound too unreasonable and you can't blame parents for wanting
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.280]   to give their kids the best if they can afford it or if they want to do it but
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.640]   if you want to do it you got to try to get to a million dollars so who should
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.520]   follow the high column the coca column well parents who have a newborn or child
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.240]   who has yet to be born because you can open up a 529 account under your name
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.000]   and then transfer it to your child's name I know one reader told me he opened
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.480]   up a 529 plan account in 2008 12 years ago and they don't have children yet and
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.440]   I think they probably want to have children a little bit sooner than that
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.040]   but you know good for him for planning ahead and I think once the kid is born
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.080]   the kid will have a pretty good 529 plan okay second parents who plan on only
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.920]   having one or two children a child is of below average intelligence and athletic
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.160]   ability so below it's not just average but below it's kind of ironic but look
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.600]   that's just the way it is it's a very competitive world out there getting
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.120]   scholarships is tough and you know not everybody is going to be average or
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.480]   above average please don't take offense the child insists on going to the most
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.560]   expensive private school whether that's grade school and college I don't know
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.760]   some some kids I hear they just don't care they want to go to the most
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.800]   expensive school and it doesn't matter if it's not their money or not parents
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.920]   who are very wealthy and are willing to make their children five to nine plan
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.200]   millionaires and are okay with with taking that risk because I think a lot
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.680]   of parents worry what if what if we give our children everything best private
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   schools huge five to nine plan you know we're driving around in nice cars we
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.320]   have a huge house are they gonna are they gonna want to work hard themselves
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.060]   and identify and build their own identity I think that's it's hard who
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.480]   knows next parents who believe college tuition will inflate much faster than
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   three to five percent a year it's possible it's been doing that for
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.840]   decades now and then finally grandparents who have enough money to
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.640]   superfund their grandchildren's five to nine plans to help reduce their estate
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.280]   super funding just in case you don't know is the ability to contribute five
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:11.120]   years worth of $15,000 a year in the first year so that is $75,000 per person
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.440]   and once you do that you can contribute for the next five years so if you've got
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.600]   a lot of cash or your grandparents want to reduce their taxable estate because
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.480]   it's above the taxable amount in 2020 that's eleven point five eight million
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.560]   per person you can do that you can superfund you you might be able to even
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.280]   fully fund the five to nine plan and go to the max but of course check with your
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.720]   lawyer and check with your estate planner and so forth I do want to
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.320]   reiterate that there is no precise and right amount you shouldn't contribute by
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:49.200]   age the goals are $100,000 $500,000 and 1 million dollars by the age of 18 or
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.800]   whenever your child wants to go to college and this is really dependent on
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.680]   your income your beliefs where you live and the future not everybody knows the
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.600]   future I don't but we can have some guesses all columns are fine if the
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.160]   amounts are aligned with your goals and beliefs if you're behind contribute more
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.600]   or convince a grandparent or loved one to contribute more if you're ahead you
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.320]   can throttle your contributions and use your money for other purposes it would
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   be irrational if you save based on the low column but of a child who is one
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.520]   year old and you want him to go to the most expensive private university in 18
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.380]   years without any grants conversely it would be irrational to follow the high
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.900]   column if your child is already 14 years old is brilliant and will likely get a
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:41.440]   free ride to any school she chooses whichever column you do choose to follow
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.640]   make sure the numbers align with your current financial situation your child's
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.720]   intelligence and work ethic and your beliefs about higher education as for my
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.920]   family we're probably going to follow the medium column the Bravo column and
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.040]   try to shoot for 500,000 per child because my kids are only three years old
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:07.000]   and almost five months old now so that's 15 to 18 years to go maybe longer if
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.280]   they decide to take a gap year who knows I've done the math and $500,000 looks
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.920]   like the realistic quote worst-case scenario in terms of cost and I'm
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.720]   generally a conservative person so I would love to build enough money in the
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:29.280]   account that it can cover 100% of the cost if necessary now I don't know
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.460]   whether I want to cover the entire tuition room and board expenses for my
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.960]   children it's always good to have some skim in the game you know working at
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.400]   McDonald's in high school really made me appreciate the value of the dollar
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.280]   because making $4 an hour while flipping burgers and cracking eggs really really
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.880]   kind of stung so I really appreciated the value of the dollar and it made me
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   work harder so this is something you got to figure out for yourself I have no
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.720]   idea exactly how my children will turn out in terms of work ethic work ethic I
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.440]   really think is the number one thing that'll help people get farther in life
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.080]   and I hope to instill that into my children by demonstrating you know dad
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.480]   waking up at 4 a.m. 5 a.m. and working or pulling the weeds or whatever but
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.160]   there's just no guarantee ideally I think it's good to save just the right
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.660]   amount in each five to nine plan but if you end up saving too much you can
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.880]   always just reassign the beneficiary to your grandchildren or someone else
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.480]   thanks so much everyone and if you like this episode I'd love a positive review
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.320]   and share with your friends gosh it took a long time to create that chart and to
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.680]   think about this but this is important we got to think about these things as
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.480]   parents and I hope every single one of you have brilliant children who won't
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.580]   need that five to nine plan at all oh there actually might be a problem you
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.840]   save too much in your five to nine plan and you didn't live as good of a life as
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.120]   you could have but let's just talk about that in a different episode thanks so
