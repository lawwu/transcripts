[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Today, we jump feet first into a boiling debate over whether female church leaders should
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.720]   be called pastors.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.240]   The question comes to us from a listener named Nick.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.260]   "Hello Pastor John, my church is changing its view on the use of the word pastor to
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.240]   include women, saying Ephesians 4.11 is the only place in the Bible where the Greek word
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.000]   for pastor is ever used and there it doesn't have any specific qualifications.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.280]   Women could fill this role and still be under male headship and a male elder board, almost
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.000]   more like a deacon or deaconess who leads specific ministries in the church, like a
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.600]   pastor over worship or a pastor over women's ministry.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.960]   But would this change in title be in line with other parts of Scripture?"
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.680]   Pastor John, what do you have to say to Nick?
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.200]   Well, let's clarify first that this is a kind of intra-complementarian debate, that is a
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.800]   debate among complementarians, a debate among those who agree that the New Testament calls
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   for spiritual, mature, gifted, qualified men to bear the official responsibility in the
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.000]   local church for governing and teaching leadership.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.920]   Complementarianism means more than that, more than just those qualifications for church
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.440]   leadership, for example, in the home and in society, but that's the relevant part for
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   this debate.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.280]   It's a debate among those who agree on that point, and the question is whether it's biblical
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.080]   or wise or misleading to use the word pastor for various roles that women can play, various
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.400]   appropriate roles that women play.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.160]   That's the issue that I'm addressing and that I've been reading about recently.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:04.040]   My answer to the question is that it is misleading and unwise to use the English word pastor
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:14.480]   for women in ministry, and that the attempt to say that it is more biblical to use it
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.720]   is built on a misunderstanding of how language works as well as the supposed use of the word
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.520]   pastor in the New Testament.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   And I'll give four reasons for why I think it's misleading and unwise and ill-founded.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   So here's number one.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:46.200]   The English word pastor in the English-speaking world today is taken to mean by almost everyone,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   everyone who knows the word, to refer to a person with official leadership in the local
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   church that ordinarily involves preaching and governing and would be roughly the same
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800]   as lead elders or overseers.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.080]   That's the ordinary meaning of the word in English.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.780]   So the question becomes, should a word with that ordinary meaning in English be used to
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.920]   refer to laypeople in the church, men or women, who do not have that kind of official leadership
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.680]   role of preaching and teaching and governing as elders and overseers?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:35.520]   And the answer of some is yes, we should use that word because the New Testament uses the
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.880]   term pastor for non-authoritative roles of shepherding.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.320]   That's the argument they would give.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.440]   So my second reason for thinking it's misleading and unwise and ill-founded to use the word
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:58.080]   pastor for those who are not elders or overseers in the church is that this argument that I
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.040]   just mentioned doesn't work, namely that the New Testament uses the term pastor for non-authoritative
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.520]   roles of shepherding.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.760]   So let me state the obvious.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.380]   The New Testament was written in Greek and, of course, doesn't use the English word pastor
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.760]   at all.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   That may seem silly to even observe that, but it's significant.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   It has a word in Greek, poimen, for shepherd.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   That word is used 18 times, that noun is used 18 times in the New Testament, one of which
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.040]   is sometimes translated pastor, namely Ephesians 4.11, where Christ has appointed pastors and
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.240]   teachers in the church.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.680]   But the ESV, for example, translates this "shepherds and teachers," and if we do that,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.240]   then the word pastor never occurs in the entire English Bible.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.600]   The other translations only have it there at Ephesians 4.11.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.400]   The ESV doesn't even translate it there as pastors, but simply shepherds.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.160]   That's the way it's translated throughout.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.760]   The noun poimen means a shepherd, and most of its uses are literally those who tend the
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.000]   flocks, like in Luke 2.8.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.720]   There were shepherds out in the fields tending their flocks by night at Christmas.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   Then comes—it comes to mean Jesus as the good shepherd or the great shepherd, as in
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.920]   John 10.11 or in Hebrews 13, and it refers once to those who shepherd and teach God's
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.840]   people, namely Ephesians 4.11.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.480]   And it also, of course, refers in Revelation and once in Luke to the ruler of God's
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   people, as in Matthew 2.6.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.720]   Here's the catch in translation.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.960]   In English, we have two words—shepherd and pastor.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.080]   Two words in English—shepherd and pastor.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   In Greek, there are not two words—shepherd and pastor.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.480]   It's just poimen.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.000]   There's one word, and it means shepherd.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.640]   There was no other word that carries the meaning of the English word pastor.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.080]   So if you really want to recover something like New Testament language, which is the
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.560]   claim being made that that's what we want to do, get back to New Testament language,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.920]   you would make a case for calling church leaders shepherds, not pastors.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.840]   That's the real claim, if you want to get back to originality of usage in the New Testament.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:50.120]   It's highly misleading to claim that in applying the word pastor to laypeople, we are recovering
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.880]   New Testament usage.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.520]   That's highly misleading, when the word pastor does not even occur in the ESV, and
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   only once does it occur in other versions.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:11.640]   So my third argument now for why it is unwise and misleading and ill-founded to call laypeople
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.360]   pastors is the observation that when the New Testament does describe its church leaders
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   as doing the work of a shepherd, with the verb poimenēn, built on that noun poimenēn,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.600]   when it does describe its church leaders as doing the work of a shepherd, they were thought
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.760]   of not as laypeople, but as elders and overseers.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.720]   I'll give you three clear instances.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.960]   Number one, in Acts 20, Paul calls together the elders, verse 17 of Ephesus, and he says
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.040]   to them in verse 28, "Pay careful attention to yourselves, you elders, and to all the
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.920]   flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.520]   So now you have two words of authoritative position, elder and overseer.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.160]   To shepherd—so this is their task—to shepherd the church of God.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:21.000]   So here he virtually identifies shepherding with the task of overseeing, and he is speaking
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.760]   to elders about their special responsibility in the flock.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   That's number one.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   Here's number two.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:36.480]   In 1 Peter 5, 1 and 2, Peter says, "So I exhort the elders among you, shepherd the
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.380]   flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight."
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:50.080]   So Peter uses the same two words as Paul does, namely elder and the task of overseeing, and
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   he calls these overseeing leaders to shepherd the flock.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   That's number two.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   Here's number three.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   In John 21, 16, Jesus says to the apostle Peter, "Shepherd my sheep."
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:12.720]   So not only is there no New Testament word that corresponds to pastor as distinct from
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.820]   shepherd, but the idea of shepherding in the New Testament was consistently associated
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.120]   with the leadership of elders and overseers.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:31.180]   So my fourth reason now for saying it's misleading and unwise and ill-founded to use
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:38.700]   the word pastor for non-elders or non-overseers, people without official governing and teaching
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:47.060]   responsibilities in the church, men or women, is that the title "Pastor Mary" or "Pastor
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:54.140]   Jane" is over time going to communicate, especially to our young people, I think, growing
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:01.140]   up in the church and people newer to the church, it's going to communicate inevitably that
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:10.700]   the office of pastor, as almost everyone understands it in English, is properly filled by women.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:20.220]   In other words, I think those who are arguing for the use of the word pastor for women ministering
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:28.120]   or men who are not elders or overseers are undermining the teaching of the New Testament
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.900]   about church leadership, even as they aim to do the opposite.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.300]   >> Appreciate it.

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.500]   her more.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.060]   Should couples pray together regularly?
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.180]   Why or why not?
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.180]   That's up next time.
