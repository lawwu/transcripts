[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   Jacob, a podcast listener in Louisville, Kentucky, writes in to ask this, "It seems like America
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.760]   is moving towards a culture where businesses such as Hobby Lobby, Chick-fil-A, and Burger
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.000]   King are taking vocal stances on issues on which the Bible speaks very clearly.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.320]   Should Christians proactively seek to patronize businesses that appear to line up with biblical
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.280]   positions and avoid those that would contradict the Bible's teaching?"
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.320]   A second podcast listener writes in and asks, "Pastor John, you recently tweeted, 'Goodbye
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.420]   Burger King,' because Burger King has gone supportive of homosexuality.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.280]   By that tweet, did you imply that Christians should not eat there again?"
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.680]   What I meant in that tweet on July 4, which said, "Goodbye Burger King.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.880]   If you wonder why, watch the last five seconds of the video and weep."
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.360]   And I put a link to the video that Burger King was spreading.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.760]   What I meant by that goodbye was, "I don't intend to eat there anymore."
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.960]   Now that could change.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.960]   They could change.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   I could change.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.680]   But for now, I'm done with Burger King.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.080]   But it did not mean, and it did not say, that others have to make a similar judgment.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.200]   I think Christians are free to eat at Burger King without my judgment upon them.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.040]   So don't go there.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   The answer to that question is, "No, I did not say that Christians should not eat at
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   Burger King.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.480]   I said, 'I'm not going to eat at Burger King.'"
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.600]   Now, here's the question.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.440]   Why did I arrive at that decision?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   What took me there?
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.280]   And to be honest, it's two levels.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.080]   There's a gut level, and then there's a reflective level.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.760]   And the reflective biblical level always has to check the gut level.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   But I'll share the gut level with you, because I think most of our lives are lived at the
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.280]   gut level, and it's shaping our minds according to Scripture so that guts are good.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.560]   It is the big business of the Christian life.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.280]   Realistically, I am moved by my gut as much as any other way, and therefore I have to
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.440]   always go back and check.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.320]   So here's the gut level.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   I thought the promotional video for Burger King that I'll link to in the tweet was disgusting
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   because of its language, immoral because of its advocacy of sexual sin, and heartbreaking
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   because of its exploitation of children, closing with a little girl, maybe four years old,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.760]   hugging two women and saying, "I love my two mommies."
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.680]   So at the gut level, I was revolted and I was angry, and I wanted nothing to do with
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.840]   that kind of crude and destructive propaganda.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   But one must always check one's gut reactions by Scripture, since we're all imperfect in
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.960]   the way we respond to things.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.360]   So here's the more seasoned thinking that leads me to stay away from Burger King.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.760]   It's an application of 1 Corinthians 10, 27 to 29.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.400]   Let me read it to you, see if you think it applies.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.860]   If one of the unbelievers invites you to a dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.680]   is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.440]   But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice to idols," then do not
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.360]   eat it for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.320]   I do not mean your conscience, but his, for why should my conscience, my liberty, be determined
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.040]   by someone else's conscience?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.300]   So here's the application I make to Burger King.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.400]   They invite me by their existence and their advertising to come and eat their burgers
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   and I am free to go, and happy to go without doing any research at all as to what the beliefs
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   of the management are about anything.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.400]   I don't care.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.760]   That's behind the scenes and they're just serving up burgers.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   I like burgers.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.720]   I'll eat the burgers.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.520]   Doesn't matter if they're covetous or racist or sexually illicit, whatever.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.200]   I'm free to enjoy the burger as a hamburger, not as a promotion of an agenda that I might
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.120]   consider offensive and sinful.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.520]   Their upper management may be philandering and racist all over the place and I don't
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   know it.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.400]   I'm just enjoying the burger and my conscience is not implicated by that, and I'm not responsible
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.240]   for their motives, and I'm not defiled by their sin.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.600]   But then comes this video where the leaders of Burger King are going out of their way
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.880]   to make sure that people know what they stand for.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.480]   In other words, Burger King wants to make it an issue.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.120]   They're making it an issue.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.360]   They're making it an issue that their burgers stand for the endorsement of homosexual intercourse.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.080]   This is not about the reality of same-sex attraction merely.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.600]   We all have to deal with that.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   That's a reality.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.920]   It's a broken reality.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.600]   We've written lots of blogs and we've talked about the heartache and how to reckon with
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   same-sex attraction.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   It's not about that.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.040]   This is about the endorsement with great fanfare of same-sex intercourse.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.840]   They want to go on record as publicly and as blatantly as possible that their restaurant
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.640]   represents the championing of homosexual intercourse.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.080]   When that happens, I am put in a situation like the person in 1 Corinthians 10 who is
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.200]   told by his dinner host, "Oh, by the way, this meat that you're about to eat, we are
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   celebrating the sacrifice to an idol."
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.180]   And Paul says, "Okay, now at this point, your freedom to eat at an unbeliever's house, which
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.960]   you certainly have, is overruled by an act of love that says the meat is no longer mere
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.960]   meat.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   It's a symbol of sin.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.240]   So to avoid confusing your host or anybody else watching, don't eat it because now the
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.920]   idol connection turns your eating into a kind of endorsement or at least a statement of
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.400]   indifference to idolatry."
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.320]   So my calling is not to crusade against Burger King.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.640]   I'm not called to lead a boycott.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.840]   My calling is to have a clear conscience and to bear clear testimony.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:04.880]   Burger King has chosen to make their restaurant a public brazen symbol of the endorsement
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.280]   of sin.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.960]   That's why I said goodbye.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.240]   And if you would like to ask your own question, please send it in to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
