[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   We have a question today from a listener named Brent.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.300]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.840]   I want to first say thank you for your ministry and for the podcast.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.540]   You have helped me grow deeper in my love for the Savior and helped me to know
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.500]   more of what his word says to us.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.580]   Thank you.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.260]   On to my question.
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.080]   I have read countless times in God's word that God is where we
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080]   will find our fullness of joy.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.260]   But I don't know what fullness of joy looks like practically.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.660]   I don't know if I've ever experienced the fullness of joy in God.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.740]   What is it and how would I know it when I saw it?
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.860]   Well, I love questions like this because they make me do what ought to have been
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.220]   done a long time ago, namely just pause over phrases and words that we use so
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.620]   often and see if I can identify biblical meanings, definitions, content, so that
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.620]   we don't just throw around our favorite phrases.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.340]   Let me just give a couple of verses where that's a really good phrase,
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.780]   fullness of joy or joyful.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:15.220]   Psalm 1611 is in my DNA, I hope you make known to me the path of life in your
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.180]   presence is fullness of joy.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.020]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.940]   Or John 1511, Jesus says, these things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.140]   you and that your joy may be full.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.580]   So Brent is asking in what sense is our joy full?
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.740]   What does fullness mean?
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.540]   Here's one thing it means in the age to come, but not yet in this life.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.660]   And then I'll give three things that I think it means even in this life.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.340]   So here's the first one that's not complete in this life, but full in the
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.940]   age to come.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.940]   In this life where our own sin and misery and other people's sin and misery compete
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:24.620]   to make us sad, we do not have fullness of joy in the sense of having so much joy
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.340]   that joy has no competitors.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.940]   Jesus was a man of sorrows in this life, not just joy, even though he had the
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060]   deepest joy of anyone in the universe.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.100]   Paul said in 2 Corinthians 6.10, we are sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.860]   So they're right side by side.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.220]   No, they're not side by side.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.020]   They're contemporaneous.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.140]   They're simultaneous.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.940]   In Romans 12, he says, weep with those who weep.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.900]   And in Romans 9.2, he describes his own heart of pain about his lost Jewish
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.380]   kinsmen.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.100]   I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.900]   Unceasing anguish.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.380]   I thought, Paul, you're supposed to rejoice always.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.100]   And again, I say rejoice.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:26.180]   So clearly, fullness of joy in this life does not include so much joy or such joy
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.820]   that all competing emotions are excluded.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.620]   We rejoice and we weep even simultaneously.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.500]   But in the resurrection, this won't be the case anymore.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.740]   Revelation 21.4, he will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.700]   Death shall be no more.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.940]   Neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.500]   things have passed away.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.620]   So fullness of joy in the age to come means so much joy that all competing
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.940]   contrary emotions will be gone.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.980]   Now, the question then becomes, is there a sense in which we can speak of
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.220]   fullness of joy in God now in this fallen world of sin and suffering?
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.300]   And let me suggest three meanings that I think are not nonsense.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.660]   They're not a contradiction of what I've just said, and they're not double talk
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.060]   when we say yes to that question.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.580]   Number one, we can be said to have fullness of joy in God if our joy in God
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:48.620]   is so full that it outweighs all other competing emotions and overflows in love
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.540]   to others.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.860]   Here's where I'm getting that.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860]   2 Corinthians 8, verse 2.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.340]   "In a severe test of affliction, the Macedonians' abundance of joy and their
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.620]   extreme poverty have overflowed."
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.900]   So their abundance of joy have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.700]   In other words, the joy in God, not in freedom from affliction, not in freedom
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:30.700]   from poverty, their joy in God was so full it outweighed affliction, it outweighed
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.820]   poverty, and it overflowed in generosity.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.300]   That is a real fullness, even if there was pain and sorrow along the way.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:50.380]   Second, we can be said to have fullness of joy in God if our joy in God is so full
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.660]   that we know we have arrived at the end of our quest for satisfaction.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.900]   In other words, there may be ups and downs in our level of satisfaction owing to sin
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:14.580]   or pain, but we never need to be in doubt that Christ is the end of our search.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.300]   We will never leave this fountain to find a more satisfying one.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.860]   Here is fullness.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.460]   He is fullness.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.860]   So Paul says, "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.260]   Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.140]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things."
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.820]   And Jesus says, "I am the bread of life.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.780]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.460]   Whoever believes in me shall never thirst, which I take to mean I am the end of your
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.260]   quest for perfect and full satisfaction."
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.220]   And don't turn to another.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220]   Stay here.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.620]   You will in due time never thirst again.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.300]   You have tasted this fullness and it will surely, surely come and remain.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:09.220]   And finally, number three, we can be said to have fullness of joy in God if our joy
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:20.140]   in God is so full that it rises to the heights of overflowing gladness in song or other forms
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.860]   of exuberance.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.500]   And I say that because Paul talks about it that way in Ephesians 5.18 where he says,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:36.540]   "Don't get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit."
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.060]   Be filled with the Spirit.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:46.940]   Addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.100]   to the Lord with your heart.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.820]   Well, what is that?
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.660]   That's an experience of the Holy Spirit's work that so fills us with himself.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.420]   That is his fruit of joy and hope and peace that we burst out in song.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.780]   And many of us have tasted this, especially in corporate worship where the Spirit comes
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:17.260]   and the hearts of people are lifted to a level of joyful fullness that they cannot keep to
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.620]   themselves.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.460]   So that's a description of the fullness of joy as well as the fullness of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.180]   Singing and making melody to the Lord.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:36.020]   Now one last encouraging reminder to all of us who fight with our own sinful incapacities
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.020]   for joy.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:47.420]   I'm sure everyone who cares about fullness of joy groans under sin and personality brokenness
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.540]   because we grew up in homes where nobody ever rejoiced, nobody ever sang, there was only
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.540]   criticism.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:09:00.460]   We're all broken people and we feel so incapable of sustained intense spiritual joy.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.660]   Well, here's the encouragement.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:10.500]   The day is coming when Christ will finally work in us the capacities to enjoy Christ.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.340]   That our capacities, not just of ourselves, but of the Father himself enjoying Christ.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:24.940]   And I get that from John 17, 26, where Jesus prays that the love with which you have loved
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.440]   me, Father, would be in them.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.740]   So the love of the Father for the Son would be in them and I in them.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.500]   Now that will be the climax of fullness.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:48.140]   And we delight in Jesus, the Son, with the very delight that the Father has in Jesus.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:54.220]   And we will love and delight in the Father with the very love and delight that Jesus
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:02.660]   has in the Father, and all of our brokenness and all of our inability will be over, and
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.020]   fullness will be the right word for that eternal experience.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.020]   I love hearing you talk about joy, Pastor John.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.820]   Thank you for diving into this question for us, and thank you for listening to the podcast.

[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.020]   We return on Friday, and a listener wants to know how we determine what biblical laws
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.100]   we should obey, and which biblical laws were fulfilled in Christ.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.780]   It's a great question and a very important conversation that we need to have.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   That's Friday.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.780]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.280]   We'll see you then.
