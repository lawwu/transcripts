[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.320]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.440]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.680]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.800]   optimizer who loves doing all the research to get the best experience in
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.000]   life without the expensive price tag.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.160]   That means optimizing travel, think flights, hotels, points, and miles,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   money, think savings, investing, and getting deals, as well as life and work.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   Think happiness, leadership, negotiation, and so much more.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.080]   To make this happen, I sit down with the world's best experts each week to
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   And this week, I'm talking to podcasting legend, Jacob Goldstein, all about
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.220]   money, many of you know him as an NPR correspondent and the co-host of
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.180]   Planet Money for over a decade.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.700]   Before NPR, he was a staff writer at the Wall Street Journal, and he
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.500]   recently published his first book, Money, The True Story of a Made-Up Thing,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.180]   which is a fascinating look at the history of how money came to be.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.420]   Finally, he just launched a new podcast this year called What's Your Problem,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.260]   where he interviews founders and CEOs about how they work to solve
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.620]   the world's hardest problems.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120]   Our conversation today will be all about money, including what's going on with
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   inflation, what you can do about it, the genesis of money, and what might be in
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   store for its future, including how crypto might fit in.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.440]   I'll also make sure to get some of Jacob's favorite money hacks along
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.160]   the way, so let's jump in.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   Jacob, welcome to the podcast.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   Hi.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.600]   You've written a lot about inflation and that it's often based on what
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.800]   people think and that whether they think there should be inflation.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.120]   So I'm curious if you think what we're in right now is a self-fulfilling
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.000]   prophecy of what people think that just will get compoundingly worse, or is
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.400]   this different because we have these supply chain issues and the Russian
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   gas stuff?
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   So I hope it's not a self-fulfilling, compounding prophecy where it's just
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   going to get worse, right?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   And it may not be.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.080]   That is maybe like the most important macroeconomic question for the sort of
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.520]   medium term, you know, for the next year, a couple of years term is, do people
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.040]   expect inflation to stay high?
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.840]   And there is this weird thing about inflation, which is inflation
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   expectations.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.000]   What people think inflation is going to do has a huge effect on what inflation
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.200]   actually does.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.000]   And for a long time, a sort of bizarrely long time, we lived in this world where
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.800]   we had persistently really low inflation after the financial crisis, through the
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   aughts, into the teens, whereby like 2019, we were in this world where
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.480]   unemployment was super low.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.680]   The economy was doing well.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   The government was borrowing tons of money.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.360]   And all of those things you would think would give you higher inflation, right?
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   That classically is a really inflationary environment.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.040]   And we didn't see it.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.920]   And part of the reason it seems it's kind of a mystery why we didn't see it.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.640]   But part of the reason it seems is because people expected it would stay low.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.440]   So now what do people think?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.680]   You know, you can look at various financial markets and people don't think
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.080]   inflation is going to stay at 8% for like five years.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.120]   So that's encouraging.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.000]   So I'm hoping people's expectations are still kind of moderate.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.720]   I was doing some quick math looking at what is inflation been like in some
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.160]   countries.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.880]   And if you go back and look, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, 8% seems like
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.360]   nothing.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.000]   But even right now, Turkey is like in the 50%.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.160]   So is 8% really that unreasonable?
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.240]   So inflation is weird because it can be nonlinear, right?
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.720]   And it's useful to distinguish 8% high inflation that we have now from your
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   certainly Venezuela, Zimbabwe is where it was like thousands of percent.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.000]   So it was just runaway and also Turkey, whereas you say it's 50% in those runaway
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.160]   cases, in those Venezuela, Zimbabwe cases.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's not just inflation.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.120]   It's basically an economic collapse.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.800]   And the inflation is as much or more an effect, a symptom of the underlying
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.720]   collapse as the cause, right?
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.200]   We don't have that.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.520]   We're not going to be Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.720]   And if somebody says that, it means they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.920]   But 8% inflation is bad.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.920]   One thing that's really striking is people just hate it.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.360]   Like people really hate inflation.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.720]   And the other simple thing is real wages are going down, right?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   If you look at how much wages are going up versus inflation, inflation is going up
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.880]   faster than wages.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.640]   And that doesn't usually happen, especially when the economy is growing.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.200]   And that means people are getting poorer and it's bad when people are getting poor.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.160]   That's the simple reason of why inflation is bad.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.760]   It is a basket of goods, and some of them can have an outweighed impact.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.880]   Are there any areas that you're aware of right now that aren't really doing as poorly?
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.160]   I know fuel prices are driving inflation significantly.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.720]   Yeah, so it's interesting to think about the different components of inflation.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Fuel is obviously the most salient one, right?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.560]   Gas, gas prices and gas prices are really interesting.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.120]   So if you look at the sort of budget, the typical household budget,
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.200]   which is the inflation basket, all the stuff a typical family buys,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.560]   gas is somewhere around like 5%.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   So it's not that much.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.160]   But one, the price of gas went up way more than the price of basically anything else.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   It essentially doubled and the price of nothing else really doubled.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.000]   Two, two is psychological, right?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.120]   You see gas prices in giant numbers as you're driving around.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.400]   You stand there pumping the gas in your car and you see the numbers going up
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.320]   in front of you.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.040]   And so it has a disproportionate impact on people's awareness.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.560]   People freak out about gas prices in a way that they don't freak out about,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.720]   say, health care, health care prices.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.480]   In fact, right now are not going up that fast, not going up as fast
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.120]   as I think the rest of inflation.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.040]   I haven't checked on that number in a while.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.280]   And health care is a bigger chunk of the household spending basket than gas.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.680]   But it's like the opposite in terms of salience.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.520]   Like if you have a job and you get health insurance through your job,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   your employer is just straight up paying a bunch of your health insurance premium.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.560]   So you don't even see that.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.640]   And then the part that you're paying comes out of your paycheck.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   So you don't really notice it unless you're looking through all the stuff
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.720]   on the gross part of your paycheck that's not flowing through to the net.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.240]   So health care is like the least salient part.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.360]   And interestingly, it's a place where at this moment, inflation is relatively low.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.640]   So those are kind of two poles.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   And to the point I made earlier about people's expectations,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.720]   one thing that I personally am fearing is.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.680]   Everyone assumes inflation is high right now.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.640]   Maybe even people are assuming it's higher than it actually is.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.800]   If you see gas prices double, that's not eight percent.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.240]   And when they report eight percent, they're annualizing a number.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.880]   So it's like if it went up one percent in a month, it would be 12 percent reported.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   Yes. Well, sometimes they're doing year over year.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.840]   They do do the month over month.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.480]   But the typical annual number they're doing the year over year.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.920]   But they're not saying in May prices went up nine percent or they are not.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   They're saying between May of 2021 and 2022, prices went up nine percent.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.600]   Nope. Like there are surveys.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.000]   People traditionally think inflation is higher than it is at baseline.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.720]   So does that give restaurants permission,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.840]   even if their underlying food costs haven't gone up 10 or 15 percent?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.520]   Are they like, you know, we might as well raise prices right now.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.480]   Everyone's going to accept it because everyone assumes prices are going up
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.200]   and it creates this.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   OK, now food prices are up and everyone's like, oh, now I need to work an extra job.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   I need to demand for my employer and employers are like, well,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.800]   if we're going to pay people, we've got to raise our prices.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.280]   And even though the underlying food might not be getting as expensive.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.800]   Well, so there's a lot in that question and it's worth unpacking it, right?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.880]   One part of that question is,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   can businesses sneak in price hikes under the veil of broader inflation?
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.840]   And it's an interesting question to think about.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   I personally am a price conscious consumer.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   I like a deal. I know what I'm paying.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.160]   I look at the price before I buy things and.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.240]   We want businesses to be competing against each other all the time.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.440]   Competition is good for consumers.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.200]   So when we order in, we usually order in Thai.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.120]   And there's two or three Thai restaurants that we order from.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.440]   And they're like pretty similar.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.600]   And if one of them suddenly got more expensive,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.400]   I would just start ordering in from the other one.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.920]   So they're competing on price.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.680]   And so if they colluded, they could raise prices.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.800]   But that's always true, right?
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.040]   I assume they're not colluding.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.760]   So I don't think there is that much room for that.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   What there is, and this is the I think most important piece of inflation right now,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.480]   is not expectations.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.600]   That's important for the long run.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   But as you alluded to earlier, basic supply and demand are the two drivers right now.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.240]   There's less supply, certainly of oil, to some extent of food,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.440]   both because of the war in Ukraine and then to some extent manufactured goods,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.400]   because China has been doing this COVID zero extreme lockdowns.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.320]   And so their manufacturing output has declined.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   So that's less supply.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.120]   And then demand is high.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.800]   And that's important for price increases.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.760]   Demand is high because, weirdly, it doesn't feel like it.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.640]   But the economy has been really strong.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.920]   It feels like all of a sudden, it's like, "Whoa, are we in a recession?"
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.360]   But unemployment is below 4%.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.920]   Savings is really high for U.S. households.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.640]   And so people are willing to pay more.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.360]   And that piece goes to your question.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.400]   People are willing to pay more because they have more money,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.120]   and also because their wages are going up.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.880]   Wages are going up faster than they've gone up for a long time,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.040]   just not as fast as inflation.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.560]   So demand is high.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.640]   That does allow companies to raise prices,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.920]   but we hope that's constrained by competition.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.480]   Let's talk about one thing that you mentioned to me right before we rolled.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.520]   Inflation can be a good thing for a certain type of product.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.560]   I won't steal your lead.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.640]   Sure, for a certain type of person, if you have debt
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.200]   and your debt is at a fixed interest rate, not a variable interest rate,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.600]   inflation, on average, makes it easier to pay off that debt.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.640]   As I mentioned, wages are going up really fast,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.120]   faster than they've gone up in a long time.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.400]   And that is partly a result of inflation.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.480]   Prices of everything are going up, and labor is a price.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.880]   We don't think of it as a price, but it is.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.280]   When you go to work, you are selling your labor,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.040]   and the price of labor is going up.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.800]   And so that's good if you are a person who sells labor for a living.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.160]   It means you're getting more money.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.080]   And notably, if you have a student loan or a mortgage that is at a fixed interest rate --
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.280]   I have a mortgage that's at 2.9% not to brag,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.200]   but I was fortunate to buy a house last year.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.800]   So, my wages are going up.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.000]   My mortgage payment is staying the same.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.920]   So, what that means is, as my wage goes up,
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.720]   I have to work less to make the same mortgage payment.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.760]   So, that's good for me.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.280]   And it's bad for the bank, frankly.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.600]   They're getting paid back in dollars that are less valuable.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.760]   The higher inflation, the less each dollar I pay the bank buys.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.000]   It's definitely a win for debtors.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   Although, obviously, in a limited way.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.120]   And people get mad when you say that,
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.040]   because nobody wants to hear that anything is good about inflation.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.960]   I'll give an example.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.360]   So, I bought a car.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.560]   And it was a Tesla that I've been waiting a year for.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   Mazel tov.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.000]   And it was two crazy things.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.960]   One, you could see the inflation because Tesla, thankfully,
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.840]   locks in the price when you buy it.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   So, when I put in the order for it last year, it was locked in at one price.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.760]   And that price went up about 20% since I ordered it.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.880]   Could you have just sold it back to the dealer for more than you paid for it?
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.800]   Well, here's the crazy thing.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.560]   I was thinking, "The price today is 20% higher, and you have to wait a year."
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.360]   So, I was like, "Man, if I could sell my place in line,
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.520]   someone would presumably pay more than 20%
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   because they would get it now instead of a year from now."
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.400]   And then I thought, "Gosh, if only Tesla reservations were on the blockchain,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.080]   it was easy to transfer, but we could get there."
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.600]   It wouldn't have to be on the blockchain.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.800]   It wouldn't have to be on the blockchain.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.840]   I know, it's just what came in my mind living in Silicon Valley.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.320]   If anybody was going to put reservations on the blockchain, it would be Tesla, right?
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.840]   If only you paid in Doge.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840]   Oh, man.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.440]   If you paid in Doge, you'd be screwed.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.280]   So, I was looking for a loan, and I will share one tip for anyone listening.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.560]   You do not need to finance your vehicle with the company you buy the car from.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.960]   Many people had told me, "Oh, what's Tesla's rate?"
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.240]   And I was like, "Well, I shopped my rate online."
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.080]   And I went and looked at tons of credit unions around the country,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.960]   and some of whom only adjust their rates monthly,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.160]   some of whom don't really adjust them at all.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.760]   And the range of rates I saw were anywhere from 3%, 4%.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.200]   Tesla, I think, was at 3.74%.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   To the lowest rate I could find for a five to six-year loan was 1.99%.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.920]   1.99% is really low for a five-year loan right now?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.000]   That's amazing.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   And that's now.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.120]   What is the mortgage now? Five or six, right?
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.560]   Yeah, it made no sense to me.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   High-yield savings accounts right now are paying...
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.520]   I know the Wealthfront Cash account is at 1.4%.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.600]   So I was like, "Gosh, you're almost at the point where if rates go up
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.960]   as expected over the next few months..."
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.120]   Two or three-year treasuries are at, what, 3% or something last I checked.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.120]   There is a tax thing there.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.760]   But yeah, it's obviously a sweet deal to finance at 1.9%. Yeah.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.560]   We're not that far away from the ability to earn more than your loan cost
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.520]   if you locked it in.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.440]   And so for anyone listening, definitely go look around.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.400]   I might even link to this Tesla Google Sheet
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.000]   where people from some Tesla forum put every credit union
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.640]   and all the deals there.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.360]   I went to credit union one, had a great experience.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.560]   Highly recommend it.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   But I locked it in.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.480]   They told me they could lock the rate in for 60 days.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.000]   And so I locked it in the morning of the Fed rate cut
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   because I wanted the most time to buy the car.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.880]   You knew it was going to go up.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.920]   You would think they would have known it too, right?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.800]   It's interesting that it was so low.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.320]   But, you know, it means you're going to be paying that money back
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.720]   in dollars that are worth a lot less than dollars are worth now.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.200]   A dollar four years from now, when you're still paying off your loan,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.040]   is going to be worth more than 10 percent less than a dollar today.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.240]   We don't know the path of inflation, but 15, 20 percent less.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.680]   It could be a lot less.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.640]   Based on Treasuries and everything, it's definitely going to be worth less.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.840]   And the thing that blows my mind, the CME group has this tool
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.760]   on their website called the FedWatch tool, and it shows the probabilities
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.560]   of rate hikes at different Fed meetings.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   And the thing that I thought was so crazy was I'm literally going to pull it up here.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.040]   And it says by the end of the year, December 22nd,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:58.680]   there is a 42.6 percent chance it will be in the 3.25 to 3.5 percent range.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.400]   And then a 34 percent chance it'll be 3.5 to 3.75.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.720]   And then an 8 percent, it's 3.75 or more.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.760]   And to be clear, that rate is just the overnight rate, right?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's not a five year rate.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's the overnight rate for the safest credit there is, basically.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.280]   So it's wild that it's going to be that much higher
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.480]   and that you were able to lock in a five year loan.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.960]   And it wasn't just one credit union.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.800]   Most of them were 1.99 to 2.5, even though people way smarter than me
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.080]   and spending more time on this than me are like 80 plus percent confident
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.760]   that rates will be in the 3 percent by the end of the year.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.120]   Yeah, it's interesting to think about what's going on on the credit union side.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.360]   Like, where are they getting the funding?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.480]   I guess it's deposits, right?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.360]   They're still paying zero on deposits.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.040]   Now, if deposit rates have to go up, then they might get underwater.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.080]   That's a thing that has happened.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.960]   They might get screwed being on the other side of your loan.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.440]   But for now, they're paying zero percent to get deposits
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.720]   and lending to a two percent.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.760]   And that's why I think it's important for everyone to realize that most banks
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.480]   that are lending the money out to you, like most of the average Chase
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.080]   Bank of America, Wells Fargo, they're paying no interest on their savings accounts.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.880]   I'm sure they're still playing literally zero.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.680]   And we've forgotten now, but checking accounts used to pay interest.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.720]   It is hard to get interest at a brick and mortar bank these days.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.400]   So I was going to ask you what you're doing to prepare for inflation.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.760]   But I'll share one thing, which is as inflation rises
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.120]   and different institutions are paying over one percent or hopefully
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   in the future, over two or three percent on savings,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.160]   leaving your money at a place paying zero percent is not a great idea.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.040]   I'm curious what you might be doing. Yeah. In preparation.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.160]   So a couple of things. Right.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.720]   As I mentioned, I bought a house a year ago.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.240]   Before that, I was saving a down payment.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.120]   So enough cash to make it worth sort of shopping around.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.000]   And I used American Express as an online high yield savings account.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.120]   And it went to zero during the pandemic when everything else went to zero.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.880]   But that one, I think it's back up. A lot of them like it.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.120]   I think I saw an ad for Marcus, which is Goldman Sachs,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.960]   sort of consumer facing online bank.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.440]   So there are a lot of just FDIC insured, totally liquid.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.600]   Put it in today, take it out whenever you want that are up around one percent now.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.760]   My favorite one.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.160]   I don't know if you've talked about it on the show.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   Have you talked about bonds on the show?
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.440]   I've written about bonds in my newsletter, and I'm doing an AMA episode
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.720]   where people are asking where to put cash right now.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.080]   And I bonds was the answer. We haven't talked about them.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   So we could just go now and I could just skip that on the AMA.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.040]   Well, I don't want to I don't want to step on you.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   No, no, no. But it's my favorite answer.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.840]   I don't generally believe in tips.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.280]   My basic investing tip is always just buy index funds, right?
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.120]   Just buy index funds and look away.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.480]   Don't do anything because whatever you do, you could do the wrong thing.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.880]   So we could talk about tax loss harvesting. Right.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:43.040]   But anyways, so my big hack with money that I'm excited about now is I bonds.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.960]   You obviously know about them, too, so we can both talk about them.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.680]   What are they? Let me ask you, what's an I bond?
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.360]   So the government has these bonds that they issue.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.000]   It's a series I savings bond.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.440]   You can only buy them on a terrible website,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.520]   treasury direct or so bad with so bad.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.200]   And for anyone who hasn't used it,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.720]   the only way you can enter your password is through a virtual keyboard
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.680]   that you have to click with each letter with your mouse really hard.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.920]   Or I think you can still buy them paper ones with your tax refund.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.280]   Yes. So you can buy them and there's limits on how much you can buy.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.920]   You can buy up to $5,000 with a tax refund and up to $10,000
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.160]   just straight up on the terrible website.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.920]   I should also make a distinction.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.560]   Sometimes people confuse them with tips, which are treasury inflation
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.240]   protected securities, I think it stands for.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   But it's a different thing.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.160]   And those are like a regular market, though.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.200]   The amazing thing about I bonds is basically they are guaranteed
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.720]   to pay an interest rate that keeps up with inflation.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   Essentially, there's some formula, but that's basically
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.160]   they have a rate that right now I think is actually zero.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.600]   It is like the base rate.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   And then they add on every six months.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.640]   They change whatever the current inflation rate is.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   So from May 2022 to October, if you get one, you'll get the first six months.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.240]   You'll get nine point six two percent interest.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:07.280]   And we should just pause and wave our hands at nine point six two percent interest.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.640]   This is the most safe borrower.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.760]   You're lending your money to the government.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.480]   The safest thing you can do with it.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.040]   You have to leave it in for a year, essentially.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.560]   There's like a small penalty if you take it out less than five years.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.880]   You have to leave it in for a year.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.400]   But getting nine point six percent interest from the government
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.440]   guaranteed is extraordinary.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I should add, depending on how fortunate you are, how much cash you have.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.360]   So it's limited to 10000 per person per year.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.080]   But you can also open an account for your kid or your kids.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.400]   So I actually I opened one for each of my daughters
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.600]   and I bought the Max last year and I bought the Max this year.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.200]   And I also have a lot of money in the stock market that I've watched go down.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.360]   But that's like to me, I now have a non-trivial amount of money
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.000]   that is very safely and comfortably going up.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.280]   And it just makes me happy to think about it.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.000]   We did the same if you have a revocable trust, which in an episode
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.960]   recently we talked about is not the same thing as these crazy high net worth trusts.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.600]   It's a pretty basic legal document that can be another entity.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.120]   And so you could do another one there.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.360]   So, you know, if you had a family of four, you could conceivably put 50,000 five
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.480]   $10,000 series I savings bonds or bonds in a year, which is a real amount of money.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.120]   And it's a real amount of money.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.840]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.440]   Even if inflation goes to zero before the end of the year,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.400]   which I think is very unlikely personally.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.480]   But even if inflation went to zero, you would earn nine point six two percent
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   for the first six months or four point eight one because it's an annualized rate
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.120]   and then zero on the rest of the year.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.080]   But even earning four point eight one percent is a much larger number
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.920]   than any other government backed place
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.160]   I've seen you could invest money for a one year horizon.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   And on the other side, right, if inflation keeps going up,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.960]   the interest rate you receive, it resets, as you said, every what is it?
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.920]   Six months. It keeps going up.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.480]   It shouldn't exist. Right.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.680]   It's a weird it's like a loophole.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.720]   I have to assume the reason there is a cap is because
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.480]   this is not a profitable endeavor for the US government.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.280]   No, it doesn't make any sense. Right.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.720]   They borrow most of their money from the market and the market
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.400]   will accept a profoundly lower rate of interest.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.600]   I think the idea is to encourage saving, right, that their savings bonds.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   Right. If you're old enough, like when I was a kid,
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.480]   your uncle would give you like $100 savings bond and they would pay $50 for it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.440]   And the idea is you hold it for 10 years and you can cash it in for 100
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.960]   or something. And I think this is the legacy of that.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.480]   It's a real hack, though.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.560]   I feel like I'm bringing a hack to the show with that.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   I totally agree.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.920]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.240]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.880]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.160]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.520]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.360]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.160]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.400]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.480]   than whatever you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.280]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.040]   And it's not just for men.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.720]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.360]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.080]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.120]   I've ever owned.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.880]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.160]   whether it's running, training or yoga.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.880]   They're also great for lounging, running around town.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.440]   Or their meta pants can even work for a night out.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.800]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.000]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off

[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.360]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.040]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.360]   or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.960]   in your bare feet, both of which happened to me recently.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.320]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.720]   especially when you do it with Fabric, who I'm excited to partner
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.920]   with for this episode.

[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.520]   and found Fabric to be highly competitive with great policies
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.000]   like a million dollars in coverage for less than a dollar a day.

[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.080]   Not available in certain states.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.680]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.640]   You talked about things not making sense that the government does with money,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.720]   which is a great thing I wanted to talk about.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.160]   In a past episode, I talked with someone about charisma, Vanessa Van Edwards.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.360]   And we talked about how it was this thing that everyone kind of knows.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.160]   But when you actually try to say, like, what is it really?
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.640]   People can very rarely answer the question.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.120]   The answer she found was that it's a balance of warmth and competence.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.920]   But I was thinking about money and your book made me think, gosh, money is similar.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.120]   It's this thing that you did an interview on This American Life for an episode.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.040]   Ira Glass called What Is Money the most stoner question he'd ever posed on the show.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.160]   And it made me think, gosh, it's this thing that we all know what it is.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.480]   But like, what is it really?
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   And that led you to write an entire book.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.840]   So I'm going to just ask now that you're the expert, like, what is money?
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:05.120]   I mean, after that setup, would it be anticlimactic to say money is what we buy stuff with?
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.240]   I mean, that's what I would say it is, but it's what you buy stuff with.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.720]   You don't need a book for that, right?
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.000]   No, no. The reason it seemed interesting enough to me to write a book about is.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.960]   At a more complex level, the answer to that question
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.480]   has changed an incredible amount over time, right?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.120]   The book is a history book, basically.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.360]   It's like a series of origin stories, really, of money.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:35.800]   And the really striking thing to me, I think, at the root is at any given moment.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.320]   What money is just seems like the natural state of the world, right?
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.720]   Like most people, most of the time don't really think about it.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.320]   They just think, oh, yes, this piece of paper in my wallet, this number in my account.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.440]   That's what money is. Fine, whatever.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.960]   That's just the way the world works.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.400]   But the lesson, the insight to me that was really interesting, exciting is
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.600]   that's not necessarily the way the world works.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.800]   It didn't used to work that way.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.640]   It'll probably be different in the future.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.840]   And so that's what's fun.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.000]   Money turns out to be this set of rules, this set of arrangements
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.840]   that a society agrees on without really realizing
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.680]   that they're agreeing on something quite often.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.920]   It is emergent and it's bottom up more than you might think.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.560]   Rather than let's have a constitutional convention and decide what money is.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.760]   So we're not going to go through the entire history
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.320]   because there's a wonderful book that I didn't advance.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.720]   But where did it all start?
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.920]   I didn't think it started where it did.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.760]   And I'd love at least that story to jump in here
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360]   and let people get a little glimpse.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   Yeah, there's where like the best guess now of where it started.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.440]   And then there's what people always thought. Right.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.400]   And it's interesting to distinguish between them.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.800]   For a long time, there was this
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.840]   sort of a parable, almost a kind of just so story
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.080]   that people told about the origin of money.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.960]   And that was before there was money, there was barter, right?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.720]   Trade and barter was inconvenient because for you and me to make an exchange,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.080]   not only did I have to have something that you want,
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.560]   but you also had to have something that I want. Right.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.520]   So maybe I've got a thing and you want my thing,
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.160]   but you don't have anything that I want.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.360]   So we can't make a deal.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.240]   And that sucks because it would be good if we could make a deal.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.080]   It'd be good for me and it would be good for you.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.640]   And money solves that problem.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.560]   Then if you want something I have, I don't care what stuff you have.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.640]   Just give me some of your money
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.720]   and I'll give you this thing that I have that you want.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.640]   That's the traditional story of money emerged from barter.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.480]   The thing is, in the 20th century, basically, anthropologists
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   from largely Europe and the U.S. started going around the world
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.560]   and studying different societies in stages of development
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.880]   that people had imagined this kind of barter universe would exist in.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.640]   And what the anthropologists found was they weren't like that into barter.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.320]   What they were much more into was social agreements
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   about the borrowing and lending and gift giving and reciprocity.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.520]   There were all these rules.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.240]   Right. And so these are basically tribal societies, right?
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.560]   They're small kinship based groups of people where everybody knows everybody else.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.120]   And there are lots of rules about exchange, essentially exchange of material goods.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.520]   And, you know, some of the sort of canonical cases have to do with marriage
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.040]   is a big one.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.160]   There are very often rules like if you're going to marry somebody,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.560]   you have to give their family, your family has to give their family cattle
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.440]   or your family has to give their family a certain kind of boar tusk or whatever.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.120]   Another one was around murder, kind of awesomely.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   Lots of societies have rules where, like, if you kill somebody,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.600]   then your family has to give their family typically same kind of stuff.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.480]   Cattle in a lot of places, cowry shells, whatever, some prescribed thing.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:47.000]   And those things, those are really proto money.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.360]   Right. Because once there's a thing where it's like, well,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.000]   probably not going to murder somebody, but my kid's probably going to get married.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.840]   And when my kid gets married,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.920]   I'm going to need some cows to give to the bride's family or whatever.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.520]   That's really, I think, the best.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.200]   Yes. For the roots of money, it reminds me of something
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.040]   I think you probably wrote in the book that said, you know,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.720]   it's also money is what you have to pay your taxes with.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.320]   It's like the reason I care about having dollars in my bank account
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.520]   is because every April I have to send dollars to the U.S.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.360]   government and they only accept that.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   It's a good starting point.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.520]   And certainly in places and times where different things
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.440]   are sort of competing to be money, that's a world we're not used to now.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.400]   But there have been times where that was the case.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.480]   If the government comes in and says, you will pay your taxes in this thing.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.520]   And sometimes it was cloth and sometimes it was some currency.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.360]   Then that thing becomes like the cows you have to give for marriage,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   a thing everybody's going to need at some point.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.720]   And yes, it becomes money.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.120]   I mean, one of the interesting things distinguishing between the sort of barter
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.920]   story and the marriage and murder story is the barter story
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.040]   is really this very cold, impersonal market story,
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.360]   which I think is the typical sort of vibe we associate with money.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.680]   But it's really interesting to me to think about the other story, right?
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.600]   The murder and marriage story, because that's a much more like
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.840]   hot, social, interactive story of what money is.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.320]   And that side of money, right, this social creation, this thing that works
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.920]   because we all agree to use something as money
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.680]   is a really interesting piece of it.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.160]   And I think underappreciated.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.120]   And you mentioned cattle as an example,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.680]   cattle is not something easy to bring up and divide and divide.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.480]   No, no.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.400]   Is that ultimately what drove to the creation of paper money?
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.680]   I need something from you.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.480]   And a cattle is just too valuable.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.920]   I don't think it was overnight that we just switched there.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.280]   What happened then when you needed half a cattle?
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.040]   And how did we end up? Good question.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.560]   So paper was much later for sort of technical reasons.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.800]   Paper wasn't invented until, I don't know, a thousand hundred years A.D.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.960]   But coins, coins came along first.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.560]   Coins came along around, I don't know, six, seven hundred B.C.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.080]   And the short answer to your question is yes.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.680]   But the longer answer to your question is before coins,
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.000]   if you go back to the ancient, ancient world,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.080]   there were these small sort of tribal societies like we talked about.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.640]   And then there were bigger civilizations, right?
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.960]   If you think of the classic cradle of civilization,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.800]   the eastern Mediterranean and those societies were very top down.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.960]   Today, we'd call them command and control economies.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.680]   There was a ruler, a king or a queen or a priest or whatever.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.600]   And they would essentially direct the exchange of good.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.760]   They would take grains from the farmers and give them to the bureaucrats
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.000]   who worked at the temple or whatever.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.360]   So there was not a market exchange,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.080]   or at least not to the extent at all that we're used to.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.480]   There was a solution to like, how do you do exchange in a bigger civilization?
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.560]   Well, you just have a king take and give and decide what everybody's going to get.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.080]   But then the first place coins really took off was ancient Greece.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.520]   Interestingly, and I think arguably not coincidentally,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.040]   certainly interestingly, around the time democracy was emerging,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.200]   what you had in ancient Greece is a classical Greece, the Olympics.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.560]   The whole thing was something that was bigger and more complex
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.440]   than a tribal civilization slash economy,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.920]   but also a more bottom up power distribution
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.280]   than you had in these very top down kingdoms.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.120]   And so you needed some new way to do material exchange
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.840]   that was neither top down nor everybody knows everybody.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.080]   And we all share the same rules.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.440]   And coins, money was the perfect solution for that.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.720]   I was blown away reading that in the 1800s,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.040]   we still had lots of different kinds of money.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.520]   It wasn't like we'd centralized on this is the kind.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.720]   So I'm intentionally fast forwarding because there's a book.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.360]   Go read the book. I thought it was great.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.000]   We don't need to recap the entire book, but I'm going to make a hard turn
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.720]   from the conversation of the history of money and talk about
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.200]   maybe a little bit of the future, which was I think you said
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.320]   there was 8,370 kinds of money somewhere in the mid 1800s in the US.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.720]   And I thought, OK, right now it feels like if you talk to a lot of people,
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.680]   the future of money is something online and there's all these cryptocurrencies.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.000]   I was like, it feels like there's probably 8,370 different cryptocurrencies.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.400]   I'm curious what happened in that last,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.720]   let's call it 200 years, watching money evolve
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.080]   from lots of different things to get more centralized.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.120]   Do you think anything like that plays out in the world of crypto?
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.400]   And how do you think it falls into the world of money?
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.600]   I know it's a loaded question.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.720]   No, it's an interesting question.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.840]   So let me just say a little thing about the moment you're alluding to in the 1800s.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.200]   And then we can jump to now because it'll help it make more sense.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.560]   So the way it worked in the U.S. in the 1830s, 40s, 50s was
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.120]   the dollar was the unit of account, but private banks issued their own paper money.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.240]   And this was still the era when paper money was like a claim check for gold.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.600]   The real value or silver, the real value was the precious metal.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.200]   And so there were, in fact, 8,000 different kinds of paper money
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   because each bank issued different looking pieces of paper.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.400]   And it was wild and interesting.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   And like you said, you can read all about it.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   But still, the underlying thing was the dollar.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.440]   So there are some elements that are similar to cryptocurrencies
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.120]   and some that are different.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.640]   And people have been writing about that.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.080]   The thing that has happened over the last couple hundred years is.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.480]   The government has gotten more and more power over money, right?
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.360]   Going off the gold standard in the 1930s gave the government
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.680]   much more power over money doing deposit insurance for banks
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.280]   actually gave the government a much bigger role in money.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.040]   And I think the central role that government has in money
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.960]   is the most important thing, both about money today and frankly,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.040]   in thinking about cryptocurrency in the context of is it really going to be money?
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   Are people really in a widespread way going to use crypto to buy and sell stuff?
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.840]   And I think it's unlikely that governments will relinquish their control over money.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.080]   They basically have a monopoly on money now.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.160]   And yeah, you can find scattered use cases like ransom
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.440]   or people who want to move money out of countries like China,
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.320]   where there are capital controls, where cryptocurrency has a clear use case.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.160]   It's striking to me how long
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.760]   in a sort of technology standpoint, Bitcoin has now existed. Right.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.360]   It was 2008 was the white paper.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.360]   And I think 2009 was when the first block was minted.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.880]   So that's a long time in a certain way for it to not really take off.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.320]   You know, I remember I started covering Bitcoin in 2011.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.520]   And at the time, I was like, wow, this is really interesting.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.000]   Either it'll work and like be this wild new thing or it won't work and it'll go away.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.920]   And the surprising thing to me is I was wrong on both of them.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.320]   It didn't really work and it totally didn't go away. It blew up.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.640]   I feel like there are a lot of non-monetary potential use cases
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.040]   for stuff on the blockchain, cryptocurrency slash the blockchain.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.360]   And I'm surprised that those haven't worked yet, like remittances
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.520]   or even just payments, right?
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.840]   Like we pay a lot to credit card companies to pay with a credit card.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   We don't see it. The merchant pays it.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.600]   But I would love it if somebody could make something on the blockchain
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.120]   that lowered fees.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.880]   People pay a lot to send money home when they go abroad to work.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.280]   It would be great if there were just some simple, boring blockchain product
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.040]   that people used who didn't care about blockchain.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.480]   That's what I'm waiting for and hoping for.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.720]   And I'm surprised that it hasn't happened yet.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.360]   And do you think it will?
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.440]   Do you think it will?
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.000]   When I think about the projects that everyone I know
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.520]   working in this industry are excited about, it's like generative art as NFTs.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.920]   And there's some value to those projects, but they're not going to necessarily
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:36.080]   change the cost for someone living in America to send money to South America.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.200]   People compare it to the Internet or to the Web.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.880]   And there was this moment in the 90s when like the Internet was interesting
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.040]   and weird and people didn't know what to do with it.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.640]   And then somebody, it was Hotmail.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.920]   Hotmail came along, which was the first Web-based email.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.480]   Before Web-based email, it was a huge hassle to get your email.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.760]   You had to have a special app on your computer.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.640]   And if you were on a different computer, you couldn't get your email,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.000]   if I recall correctly.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.440]   And so it was just this obvious killer app that was useful,
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.080]   even if you didn't care about the Web, per se.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.000]   It just let you do a thing.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.800]   And it wasn't about the technology.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   It was about the thing it let you do.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.400]   And that's all I want out of blockchain.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.920]   Like, I want something if it's finance, sure,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.200]   but just to have it be financing something in the real world.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.360]   DeFi just seems to be financing other DeFi.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.680]   It's just like a Russian doll of people borrowing in crypto to buy more crypto.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.160]   I believe that finance can do useful things in the world.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.840]   I don't know.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.080]   I mean, when you talk about whatever NFT art projects, truly, what do you think?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.640]   I view it like a project where I'm like, OK, the entire crypto experience,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.360]   I don't know what it will become.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.280]   There's enough use cases that people talk about.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.080]   You mentioned remittance, title insurance.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.960]   There's all these things waiting for a real project.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.760]   I think it's crazy that when you buy a house, you pay a company to title insurance.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.920]   It's like an anti hack, right?
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.960]   Title insurance.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.800]   You just get hosed.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.760]   And then someone else pays that insurance the next time they buy the house.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.800]   And you're all insuring against the thing that, you know, it's crazy.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.400]   Yeah. Put my title in the blockchain, please.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.040]   You know, please.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.640]   But I haven't seen it.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.920]   But some of the smartest people I've ever met are all working on different projects
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.120]   and some of them in earning yield, some of them in NFTs
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.240]   and some of them in crazy other stuff that's still taking shape.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   And so I do think there is a future of use cases that we haven't seen.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.120]   And I can't remember which podcast it was that I heard Chris Dixon
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.160]   from Andreessen Horowitz on.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.880]   And he made a kind of crazy case of when the app store came out for the iPhone.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.600]   No one really knew what the apps were.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.040]   It was like there were people that were like, oh, I want a calculator
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.600]   that can do some advanced functions, because that's what we were thinking of.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   But so many things happened that were out of our wildest dreams.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.160]   We couldn't even come up with them.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.120]   And so I believe those things are coming.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.720]   I'm just I've been waiting.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.680]   Like you. It's been a while.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.160]   I think when did the iPhone came out?
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.680]   I think Bitcoin is about as old as the iPhone.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.120]   It's certainly taking longer than the app store did to deliver.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.760]   I mean, and whatever.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.360]   Easy for me to say because I'm not doing the work.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.240]   But like you, in a way, the collapse in crypto prices might be useful
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.200]   because there is so much like scammy noise around crypto
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.240]   that it's just obviously scammy noise that you just want to wave it all away.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.760]   And maybe the crash will sort of wash out the scammy noise to some extent
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.160]   and leave the people who are actually working in good faith
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.200]   on potentially useful projects.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.080]   We both share a common story that almost a decade ago for me,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.040]   I had some Bitcoin and I made a purchase where I was looking online
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.920]   and I was like really into fantasy football.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.080]   I was really into fantasy football for a few years.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.480]   And there was this site that I'm not going to say
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   I understood whether it was legitimate or not, but you could get access
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.600]   to stream all the football games of the season for the low price
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.120]   of a Bitcoin or something.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.640]   It was like maybe it was half of the time that this was not legitimate.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.400]   But let's keep going.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.680]   And I remember thinking, gosh, you know, it would be way more expensive
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.200]   paying for NFL Sunday ticket because that's $300.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.680]   And you got to get DirecTV.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.480]   Looking back, it was probably like a $10,000 subscription
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.320]   to watch 16 or 20 games during a season.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.560]   I know you also bought a sandwich that probably maybe is a $10,000 sandwich.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.280]   Yeah, me and another reporter, David Kessenbaum and I went,
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.280]   we bought falafel and like a smoothie.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.520]   And this was when Bitcoin was like, I don't know, 20, $20 for one Bitcoin.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.800]   Well, it's cheaper now than it was six months ago, right?
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.720]   Six months ago, it was a $50,000 lunch, and now it's a $20,000 lunch.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.840]   So if it keeps going, maybe it'll get back to normal.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.560]   To your earlier question about money and crypto, money doesn't work that way.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.200]   You don't regret buying a sandwich because the value of money,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.320]   it actually appreciated so much like you don't hodl money doesn't make sense.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.880]   That's not what money is for.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.600]   On a simple level, it demonstrates the extent to which certainly Bitcoin is not money.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   And I think the closest thing to money in crypto,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.520]   ironically, given the history is stable coins, which is funny,
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.760]   given that so much of the sort of crypto noise is about the unreliability of the dollar,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.400]   that the thing that actually functions like money is the thing that is pegged to the dollar.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.520]   Science has shown that being charitable can actually have a huge impact
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.440]   on your happiness, which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.560]   They're a not for profit community built around a new, modern way to give,
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.240]   and they have a mission I think we can all get behind.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.160]   Helping people be more generous more often.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.320]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving because they offer an account
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.920]   that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.640]   You can make a one time contribution or you can set a little aside each week or month.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.680]   And all your contributions are tax deductible,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.480]   except you don't actually have to know exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.040]   In fact, you can make your tax deductible contribution now
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.240]   and invest that money into stocks or even crypto
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   so it can grow tax free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.440]   Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than one
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   and a half million charities, schools or faith based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.440]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.600]   if you want to start giving today.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.240]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.200]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:30.160]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.720]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.480]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.560]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.520]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.960]   the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.120]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.280]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.760]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.440]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list,
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.320]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.560]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.480]   on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.880]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.160]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.520]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.520]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to Drizly.com.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.800]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.080]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.960]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.680]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.880]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.280]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.360]   To get back to the book at the end, you had this conclusion
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.520]   section of the future of money and you had these three possibilities.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.760]   And sure, there are more.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.080]   But I love the three, which was a world without cash, a world without banks
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.400]   and a world that sounds like the world you described in the past,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.560]   which was the government's going to kind of manage it all and print money
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.080]   and give it to anyone who wants a job.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.800]   Is one of those a world where you actually think this is where we're going?
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.200]   So the world without cash is probably the most reasonable of those.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.720]   It certainly feels like cash is going away.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.680]   There are a couple of things to say about that, though.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.080]   One is, in fact, cash is not going away.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.480]   In fact, there is more cash than there has ever been, despite what it feels like.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   There's an extraordinary amount of cash in the world now.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.560]   When I wrote the book, it was something like forty four zero
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.840]   hundred dollar bills for every man, woman and child in America,
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.120]   which is just astonishing when you think about it.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.280]   More hundred dollar bills than one dollar bills.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   And so then there's the question of, like, where is it right?
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.600]   Where are all those hundreds?
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.240]   And the awesome answer is we don't exactly know because it's cash
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.320]   and kind of the whole point of cash, certainly the whole point of hundreds.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.560]   Let's be honest, is it's like nobody knows where it is.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.360]   It's not tracked.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.200]   It's pretty clear that a lot of it is outside the United States
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.560]   in a lot of countries where the banks are unreliable,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.800]   where the currency is unreliable.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.000]   People like U.S. paper money as a real store of value.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.240]   So that seems useful.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.000]   And it's a good export for the U.S., right?
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.200]   People want to give us stuff and we give them paper.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.320]   That's a good deal.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.360]   Also, crime.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.000]   People just use paper money to commit crimes a lot.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.040]   There was this story that came out after I wrote the book.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   It was at the beginning of the pandemic when all the stores shut down
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.400]   and in L.A., in Southern California.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.480]   The DEA just started seizing these vast sums of cash.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.240]   And what had happened was the drug dealers in L.A.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.880]   were using these stores to launder their money.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.600]   And when the stores shut down, they couldn't launder their money anymore.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.240]   So the money was just like piling up and they just had all this cash
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.920]   that they couldn't hide anymore.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.360]   So that is still going to happen.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.280]   The other piece of it is money is largely already digital.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.880]   If cash goes away, I mean, there are certain people
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.080]   like people don't have access to bank accounts.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.240]   And so you would definitely want to create a system
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   to basically give those people bank accounts, give everybody a bank account,
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.480]   give everybody a debit card. That's solvable.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.440]   The key thing is our money is already mostly digital, right?
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.520]   Even though I think if people sort of close their eyes and think about money,
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.440]   they'd think about a $20 bill or a $100 bill.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.640]   The vast majority of money in the world is just a number on a bank's computer.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.040]   So if cash goes away, the world wouldn't look that different.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.360]   Harder to commit a crime, harder to save money
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.600]   if you live in a country with like bad banks and a bad currency.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.720]   I don't know how much, but there's a decent amount of our
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.280]   economy that happens with cash.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.480]   People that get paid in cash don't pay taxes again.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.440]   Maybe it's good that that happens.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.560]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.840]   There was this famous moment in Italy
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.560]   when they decided to start including in GDP
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.720]   and the measure of their overall economy, the black market, the illegal economy.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.320]   And because of the nature of the Italian economy,
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.560]   their GDP grew a ton when they decided to start counting it.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.880]   And I think they passed to the UK.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.960]   They became a bigger economy than the UK.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.200]   And they had a celebration.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.320]   They called it il sorpasso because like, hey, we're bigger than the UK, which is fun.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.360]   My fun moment was I had a tenant and we had an Airbnb
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   and we were talking about the US economy is from Germany.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.360]   And we talked about cash.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.080]   He was like, oh, do you want me to pay you with cash?
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.800]   Is it OK if I send it electronically?
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.160]   Do you take credit card?
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.280]   We were talking as he's like, because in Germany, we say that cash is tax neutral.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.040]   And I thought that was the best description of cash I'd heard to date.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.640]   Cash neutral is funny.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.400]   I mean, arguably, it's tax negative.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.600]   If in the proper world, you're paying the tax that you pay in cash,
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.280]   you don't have to pay the. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.600]   Anyway, that depends on what your baseline is.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.080]   It's good that you've learned a lot about money.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.720]   You've researched it, talked about it, run a podcast for over a decade.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.840]   But I saw you say that before you started thinking about money,
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.680]   you didn't really think about it that seriously.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.720]   It became this thing that you're now known for.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.440]   And now that you have a family and kids, I'm curious what kinds of money
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.040]   related lessons or thoughts you're trying to pass on
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.480]   so that they have a better understanding earlier on, maybe you did.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.080]   The way I thought about money before I started.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:33.920]   Studying it and writing about it was I was always really into saving money
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.160]   and not spending money.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.520]   Yeah, just the way I was raised.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.360]   My personality is I like a deal, I think twice before I buy things.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.280]   And it's interesting you ask about my kids.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.120]   And so I think I think a lot about with them is what's the right balance?
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.760]   Like, I think I was
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.840]   neurotically cheap to some extent or in some settings.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.000]   At the same time, I'm glad that I know the value of a dollar. Right.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.840]   And don't take for granted buying stuff.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.360]   And so what I'm trying to
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.400]   teach or model for my kids, because the modeling is the real thing with kids,
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.480]   what you do is really what matters.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.520]   So what I'm trying to model for them is some happy medium, right?
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.360]   Like a recognizing that we're fortunate to just be OK
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.960]   and not have to worry about buying food and paying the rent.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.120]   That's a big one. Right. Don't take that for granted.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.920]   We're lucky to it's OK to buy yourself something nice.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.800]   But remember, if you buy this thing, you're going to have less money
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.720]   and less ability to buy something else in the future.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.400]   So is it worth it to you?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.840]   It's that idea of value.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.160]   That's really what I want to teach my kids.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.440]   And how are you modeling those two things?
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.160]   Well, it's hard.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.840]   I mean, I'm trying to be like thoughtful about money, but not neurotic.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.320]   Like, I'm just trying to be the money person
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.120]   I aspire to be in my behavior in front of them.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.080]   Do you talk about, oh, we're going to make this decision?
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.160]   You mentioned you got to bought a house.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.320]   Did you? I don't know. I don't know how old your kids are.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.800]   So maybe that's too much.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.440]   They're, you know, nine and eleven.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.800]   I explained to them the mortgage.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.160]   You know, I explained to them how a mortgage worked.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.760]   And for that matter, we lived in an apartment before and we had a mortgage.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.960]   And I explained to them, they're curious, smart kids.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.200]   So I explained to them, we're going to sell the house and we're going to get money
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   and we're going to use that money to pay off the bank for this mortgage.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   And then we're going to have some leftover
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.400]   and we're going to use that to buy some of the house that we're buying.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.200]   And we're going to get a loan.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.760]   They were into the mechanics of it.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.040]   And we talked a lot about it.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.960]   So like that part is just fun.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.040]   I'm a nerd. My kids are kind of nerds.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.400]   The mechanics part, to me, that's like the fun, easy part.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.880]   The more certainly the harder and maybe more interesting.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.600]   Ultimately, a part is the more emotional, frankly, more emotional part,
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.040]   because like rationally, I save a lot of money and I'm fine and we're fortunate
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.200]   and I work and my wife works and whatever.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:47.600]   But there's a large emotional component to money and managing that
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.200]   and being reasonable about money that I find hard at some level.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.920]   There's an unlimited number of studies that show that people who have money
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.280]   would think they will be happier if they have more money.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.320]   I think it's probably the hardest emotional thing to solve,
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.600]   whether it's keeping up with the Joneses or the hedonic treadmill
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.880]   or whatever name you want to give it.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.560]   Yeah, I have not found someone
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.160]   give any kind of here is exactly how you fix that.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.960]   The answer has been you just have to accept that what you have is enough
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.720]   and maybe it's gratitude or is there anything you've picked up
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.080]   in all the episodes you've done or conversations you've had
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.960]   that would help someone get out of that rut of always thinking
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.560]   more would be better and not being content with what they have now?
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.480]   At a broader level, and this might be too broad, but
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.560]   a thing I have found in my life, frankly, more than in my work,
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.480]   is that I'll have some emotion about money or about work or something,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.640]   some worry, I worry a lot, whatever, and then I'll go for a jog.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   I like to jog.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.360]   I found that exercising just makes me less worried and I'll feel better.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.320]   Right. I'll stop worrying about the thing I was worried about.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.120]   But the thing hasn't changed at all.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.760]   The money situation in my life or the thing at work or whatever
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.560]   I was worried about.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.440]   And so, like for me, a big insight of adulthood has been
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.880]   my emotions are more about what's going on inside of me
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.640]   than about what's going on out in the world.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.080]   To me, the key thing to worry less is to not fix something external.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.800]   I mean, unless you have some horrible thing in your life,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.880]   but unfortunately don't have horrible things in my life.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.200]   It's to manage myself.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.040]   It's to run. It's to whatever sleep.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.240]   If you need to sleep, take a break. If you need to take a break.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.040]   It's recognizing that the source of a lot of problems, a lot of worry is internal.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.840]   It's interesting.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.960]   My answer would have been something that I don't think contradicts
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.320]   what you said, but compliments it on the other side,
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.680]   which is a lot of the source, I think, of people's struggles
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.560]   with money or thinking that most people have more than them,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.600]   which I actually think is not true.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.560]   And so my challenge to people is if you're feeling like
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.040]   you can't keep up with the Joneses, per se, try to just talk about money.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.440]   It's like the most uncomfortable thing.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.760]   And I don't know if people will, but I imagine the person on Instagram
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.160]   who posted a photo in a Greek island that you're jealous of,
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.320]   talk to them about money and they might say, "Gosh,
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.560]   we're still struggling to pay off our student loans."
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.080]   And you're like, "Oh, well,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.280]   just that they're not posting their student loans on Instagram, right?
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.800]   They're not posting the credit card payment they missed."
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.880]   And so your example is think inward.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.440]   And mine is a complimentary one, which is talk to the people
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.480]   that aspire to be like, and you might find out you're a lot more like them
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.840]   or you might even be better off.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.520]   They just might be making you look like you're not better off
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.160]   because all you see...
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.360]   Stay off Instagram also, right? Instagram is a vehicle for that.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.480]   I mean, one word that's interesting to talk about in this context,
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.400]   I think it's under discussed in the context of money and other things is status.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:43.960]   Right. A lot of the time, obviously, money and status are closely linked.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.440]   And sometimes what people will articulate
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.160]   as a worry about having enough or whatever is actually a worry about status,
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.080]   a worry about, "Oh, I am lower status than this person who went to Greece or whatever."
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.520]   And I don't know exactly what to do about that.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.920]   Like in my dream world, it was don't care about status.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.000]   But I haven't been able to not care about status, candidly.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.360]   Like we're hierarchical animals.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.320]   It's very hard to not care about status.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.400]   But I think to at least be aware of it and be aware of what status games
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.480]   do you want to play, what status games can you get out of playing,
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:21.000]   whether that's at work or with respect to material things
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.720]   or the kind of car you have or whatever.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   Just an awareness that a lot of what we think of as, "Oh, I need this
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.880]   or I need that, or I'm worried that I'm not going to have enough money,"
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.280]   is really a kind of status hierarchy
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.200]   primate brain doing weird things in the way we think about money.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.400]   That I also find helpful.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.280]   There's a person that I could think of that might have some suggestions,
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.560]   and I will take it as homework to bring him on the show in the future.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.560]   Is Ryan Holiday, who talks a lot about stoicism.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.280]   If I were going to try to solve that with a conversation,
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.080]   I feel like he would be the best sparring partner for that.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.280]   So that's a great idea.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.000]   I will send you a note when he comes on, which if anyone listening is like,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.160]   "I'm buddies," send him a note.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.360]   I don't know, Ryan, but I will find my way to him.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.680]   I mean, that guy does a ton of stuff.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.520]   I bet you could get him on the show.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.560]   So that's a great idea.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:08.920]   Thank you.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.400]   Before we wrap, I have a couple of things.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.640]   You said you're a nerd about money.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.800]   You love a deal.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.360]   You love saving.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.480]   In our first conversation, before we hit the record,
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.160]   I know you've said you've got some hacks for money.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.520]   I'd love to hear what are the things that you do
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.320]   that you often find your friends or peers or colleagues being like,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.960]   "Oh, that's great. I got to start doing that," other than the iBonds,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.160]   which will go down as the main one for the episode.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.600]   Oh, yeah, that's the big one.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.040]   Everything else is so small and goes more to the neurotic side.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.720]   It's like the stuff where I don't actually save that much money.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.880]   And in the big picture, I just like the feeling of getting a deal.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.680]   Do you know the website Auto Slash?
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.720]   This is a weird one.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.440]   But there's a website called Auto Slash.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.600]   So I just bought a car for the first time a couple of years ago.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.800]   I live in New York where you can get around without a car.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.760]   So before the pandemic, I didn't have a car.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.800]   And so we would rent cars pretty often if we're going to go away
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.760]   through the weekend or whatever.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.080]   And renting a car in New York is really expensive.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.960]   And so there's this weird website called Auto Slash,
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   where you just type in where you want to rent a car and who you are,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.000]   what kind of car you want to rent, if you're a member of Costco or the AAA,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.880]   or if you have this credit card or that credit card.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.120]   And the weird thing about it is it's not instant.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.400]   But I don't know.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.560]   An hour later, they email you rental car deals
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.360]   and they tend to be really good deals in New York.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.640]   It's like the difference between 100 or 150 bucks a day
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.360]   and like 25 bucks a day for a rental car sometimes.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.760]   So it's like a big deal.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.960]   I don't know. Is that too little?
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.200]   Is that the wrong size hack?
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.520]   I think I would say no, because the CEO of Auto Slash, Jonathan Weinberg,
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.840]   is actually we're recording an episode next week all about rental cars.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.760]   So, you just teed that up perfectly.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.040]   But yeah, I think rental cars, especially right now,
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.320]   there's no supply of cars in the market.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.960]   I noticed when we ordered our Tesla, they said it's going to come in April.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.920]   We had our second child in June.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.440]   Car hadn't come.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.200]   Car said in the app it's coming in July.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   And we're like, "We could manage for a month in a car that doesn't fit everyone.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.480]   That's OK." And then it said, "OK, it's got pushed back.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.960]   It's no longer July.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.920]   It's going to be somewhere between December and next April."
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.440]   And we were like, so I called Tesla.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.440]   I was like, "What is going on?"
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.480]   And they're like, "It's normal that the dates shift like that."
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.640]   I was like, "What do you mean it's normal that the dates shift by six months?"
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.880]   It's normal that you go buy a car and drive home.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.480]   That's what's normal, Tesla.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.240]   And then a week later, it shifted back.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.880]   This is the thing that I thought was so crazy.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.840]   It said August 11th to October 12th.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.440]   And I was like, "OK, I guess it's normal that it shifts by six months."
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.200]   And then the next week, it said August 12th to October 13th.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.240]   And I was like, "How could a company have enough
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.680]   precision to change my delivery estimate by a day?"
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.480]   But the window is still two months, right?
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.080]   We know it won't be August 12th anymore.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.160]   It's still a big window, but we're shifting it by two percent.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.680]   The hack for this, though, that I learned, which I didn't want to share
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:57.440]   until I got the car right now, I don't care, is that when Tesla has a car
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:00.960]   that is ready for pickup, they email someone and say, "Hey, your car's here."
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.080]   And if in three days you're not ready for it, they put it to someone else.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.080]   Ah, so can you like fly standby with Tesla?
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.000]   Can you get on the "I want to be on the someone else" list?
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.520]   I wouldn't say it's accepted, but it's also maybe not prevented.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.560]   This is the perfect hack window.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.760]   So if you go not to the showroom, but the delivery center.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.920]   So in every major area, there's a delivery center.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.000]   In the Bay Area, it's in Colma.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.400]   Famous for its cemetery.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.040]   Yeah, it is. That's all I know about Colma.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.640]   I would say it helps if you genuinely have a need.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.320]   We went in, we're like, "Our family doesn't fit in the car we have today."
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.520]   People are willing to make an exception.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.760]   If you're flexible, you're like, "We'll change the color." That's fine.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.960]   We found someone and they said, "Look, if a car shows up
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.240]   and no one wants it after two and a half days,
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.240]   or if we get a verbal confirmation that they don't want it,
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.880]   we'll give you a call because they want to get the car off the lot.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.040]   And if they know someone that's going to come right away, it's helpful."
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.440]   I think they're supposed to put it back in the queue
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.880]   and give it to the next person in line.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.720]   What we ended up getting was a car that came in six months ago
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   and had something wrong with the door because they prioritize
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.920]   people who own cars, they prioritize fixing their cars.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.000]   This car just sat there for four or five months before they fixed the door.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.600]   And now it's technically a 2021 and the new cars are 2022s.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.240]   So they kept calling people and saying, "Hey, your 2022s here.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.760]   It's actually last year's model." Nothing changed.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.880]   They changed like the charge port is slightly different. And that's it.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   And for anyone listening who's a huge nerd,
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.720]   they also added this swiveling screen that's motorized,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.400]   but it didn't matter to us.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.640]   So they're like, "Gosh, here's a person that said, 'I will take it.'"
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.880]   Let's stop calling people that keep saying no and give it to that person.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.280]   So you just got it now.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.560]   You got it in June instead of August to October and your whole family fits in it.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   We got it yesterday.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.000]   I spent yesterday afternoon putting two car seats in there and getting it all ready.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.720]   But yeah, it's a one day old car with a 1.99% loan that I'm excited about.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.640]   That's a good hack. What else you got?
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.200]   I hit really hard the filters on like kayak,
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.440]   like really hard kayak trip advisor in the left rail on kayak.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.280]   You can do all kinds of dialing.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.120]   So I live in New York, for example, and there's multiple airports, which is helpful.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.160]   I'm big at just pricing different things.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.800]   There is some price for which I'd be willing to fly on Spirit Airlines.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.320]   There's some amount of price differential that makes it worth it.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   Depends on am I flying with my kids and it's going to be a lot more.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.480]   On the other hand, the thing about flying with kids,
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.840]   as you know, is everything is suddenly 4X.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.320]   Here's one. OK, here's a hack.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.400]   I don't know if it's a hack. I find it useful as a hack.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.800]   If there's some recurring thing you pay for, whether it's a monthly bill is easy,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.880]   but even like a thing you buy at the grocery store every week, annualize it.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.400]   Right. So if you're spending an extra 10 bucks a week at the grocery store
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.600]   on something, something's 10 bucks more than the other thing.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.560]   That's actually 500 bucks a year. Right.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.760]   And I find saying, is this worth an extra 500 bucks a year
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.280]   to me feels different than is this worth an extra 10 bucks to me every time?
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.440]   That's a sort of behavioral hack, right?
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.000]   It's a way of framing things that helps me spend less, frankly.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.360]   And same with subscriptions.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.400]   Obviously, subscriptions are killer that way.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.960]   There are those products now.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.120]   They're a subscription product to manage your subscription products.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.040]   And I've been interested in those because I have so many now, like for software,
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.080]   like I have Microsoft and Adobe and Dropbox and all these ones
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.120]   that I don't use that much, and they are all together.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.880]   Certainly hundreds, maybe $1,000 a year.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.080]   I could use a hack on that one, I think. Can you help me?
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.040]   So Truebill is a sponsor of the show.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.320]   Oh, and as people know, no, no, no.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.840]   I didn't ask. You're welcome.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.680]   You're welcome. Truebill.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.760]   I've had all the products that services anyone that wants to sponsor the show.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.880]   I'm like, I am very serious.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.160]   I'm like, I'm going to use the product.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.040]   I'm going to try the product.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.520]   My wife will try the product.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.360]   And I say no to most of them.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.400]   So I downloaded Truebill.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.680]   I'd never used it before.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.960]   They're getting a free ad here.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.800]   It's not part of the ad.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.440]   But basically, what you can do is you can see a calendar
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.840]   of when all your subscriptions are, where they are, even just the free version
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.840]   of not hiring them to do anything.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.880]   And it's just what are they?
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.800]   Yeah. And that's for so many.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.840]   There's so many. And they recur.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.760]   I mean, there's the simple things of right when you sign up,
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.000]   make sure it's not automatically recurring.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.040]   That's a useful one.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.880]   There are so many like very often I'll get an email that's hey,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.080]   thanks for renewing your subscription for another year.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.520]   We just billed you 90 bucks.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.840]   I'm like, ah, that's a little heck.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.240]   I'll give you two ones for this.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.400]   One is if you have a Capital One card,
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.080]   they have this browser extension called Eno.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.840]   And I dislike the fact that they have hijacked a keyboard shortcut
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.160]   that I used for something else.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.040]   But other than that, what they do is they give you a virtual card for everything.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.160]   So you install this browser extension.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.880]   And a lot of the virtual card companies like Privacy is an example.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   They route your money through your bank account.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.120]   You don't earn points. I don't love it.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.440]   I like the advantages.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.200]   It doesn't automatically renew, right?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.760]   It's sort of self-destruct.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.360]   So they can't bill you again.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.320]   That's so because this one's tied to Capital One, the card issue.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.520]   You still earn all your rewards.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.880]   So it's next level.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.160]   But you can say for this card, I want to only allow a purchase of $100
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.320]   or I want to go manually turn it off.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.560]   I want to buy a subscription. It's a one year thing.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.640]   They don't have the ability to cancel it.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.200]   Maybe you have to call to cancel.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.720]   I just buy it and immediately turn off the billing for that card.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.200]   And the great thing is it's just not going to go through.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.120]   They're going to say, "Hey, we have to cancel your subscription."
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.520]   Now, Truebill does have a feature where you can say,
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.160]   "Hey, just call them for me and cancel it."
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.760]   And like that is a part of their premium subscription.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.080]   They'll just do all that for you.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.720]   But I like to use Capital One's thing because you still get the points,
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.640]   but they will go in and cancel the thing.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.280]   And it just happens that I use my Capital One card for a lot of Internet stuff
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.000]   because it's the two X on everything, not the travel bonuses and grocery bonuses.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.960]   OK, that's a good one.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   You got any travel hacks for me?
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.000]   And here's the thing for me with travel hacks is again, because I have kids,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.520]   I'm definitely in the like schmuck category now where I have to go
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.120]   at the time when everybody goes, I have to fly the weekend.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.560]   You don't want to have to fly.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.160]   So I'm starting in a bad place, right?
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.440]   I'm starting where I'm the guy who has to pay retail for the seat.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.600]   And I don't want to be that guy.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.120]   What can you do for me?
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.800]   So I mean, going back and listening to a handful of episodes
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.280]   is probably not the best answer.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   I'll probably cut that.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.680]   Maybe I won't. Maybe I won't.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.200]   The best answer is you should have been listening to the podcast.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.120]   We got a handful of episodes to tackle this.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.280]   The hard answer is.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.200]   I sometimes think that if you have the points, things open up last minute,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.520]   so it's like the scary option, which is if you could find something
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.480]   all sometimes by the Southwest flight that I can cancel last minute,
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.200]   pay for a refundable fare and then keep looking for the for the last.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.560]   Yes, but not.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.480]   And most of the airlines now are cancelable and you get a full credit.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.120]   You don't have to pay a fee. Right.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.080]   So if you book with an airline where, you know, I fly Delta all the time.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.480]   If I have to cancel this and get a $500 Delta credit, it's going to be OK.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.280]   Buy the ticket.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.320]   This is something I'd like to buy the ticket and then make the barrier
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.680]   having to cancel it when you get a better deal instead of holding off
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.560]   and making the action.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.160]   I have to go buy it. That's nice.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.520]   And so I say buy it and then check in regularly
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.880]   as late as the day of or the night before.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.680]   Sure. A lot of times within the last week,
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.720]   tickets are really, really inexpensive with points.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.080]   My wife's family wants to come visit because we had the new baby
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.720]   and they're coming next week, like within five days.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.560]   And we looked on United and they live in Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.400]   which is notoriously an expensive place to fly to because it's just United
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.440]   and Southwest.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.520]   And they route through Denver and they have a monopoly over the airports.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.440]   And it was so cheap for points.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   It was like the lowest inventory, 12000 points each way or 12.5
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.280]   for a ticket that was like six or seven hundred dollars.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.560]   So it ended up being a fantastic deal because they booked within a week.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.440]   What they could have done is bought a Southwest ticket a month ago,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.600]   canceled it if they needed to.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.800]   I also want to talk about the podcast.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   I mentioned it in the intro, but you started a new podcast
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.040]   after being in this space longer than most.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.400]   What led you to this topic and maybe share a little bit more about?
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.640]   Yeah. So I started this show called What's Your Problem?
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.360]   And it's really a show about people solving technical problems in the real world.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:27.200]   I talked to engineers and founders of companies that are doing things
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.120]   that seem interesting and important to me.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.360]   Drone delivery.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.600]   Self-driving cars, but also events markets.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.840]   I just interviewed somebody who started the first company
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.560]   that was approved by the CFTC to let people bet on real world events.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.440]   That's an interesting one.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.280]   And what led me to start it was, I mean, it just seemed fun to start something,
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.200]   frankly. Right.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.080]   But I think that sort of the big idea that I got excited about
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.200]   when I started learning about economics, as which didn't happen
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.600]   until relatively late in my life, was this idea that
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.200]   the pie can get bigger, that everybody can be better off,
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.720]   that the world is not fundamentally a zero sum game.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.080]   I feel like that is actually the big insight of economics.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.640]   And I didn't know it before.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.160]   And I think it's not intuitive, right?
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.720]   I think the intuitive.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   Idea of the world is it's zero sum.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.120]   If somebody is getting more, somebody else must be getting less.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.480]   But that's not true, right?
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.800]   Like the good news of economics is everybody can get richer.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   Everybody can have more.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.040]   And the way that happens is.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.240]   Technological improvements, basically, people figure out
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.520]   how to get more stuff out of a day's work, right?
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.880]   People figure out new efficiencies, ways to do new useful things.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.400]   The big idea of the show is let's talk to the people
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.800]   who are actually figuring that stuff out.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.400]   I think next week is going to be DNA storage, right?
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.480]   People are figuring out how to store data in DNA, which is just like rad.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.520]   And apparently you can fit the whole Internet in a shoebox.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.000]   But of course, it's super expensive now.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.080]   And there's all these hard problems.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.840]   How do you make it cheaper? How do you make it actually work?
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.120]   So that's the idea of the show.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.680]   I've been listening. It's great.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.360]   I pitch you on a non-technical, but it's a shame there's the technical requirement
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.160]   because I think the zero sum game with travel, I think that's something I love.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.000]   I'll work on technology. I'll get back to you.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.960]   Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to book David Nealman, the guy.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.000]   He started JetBlue, which is actually an interesting kind of econ story.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.520]   And then he has a new airline now.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.440]   I forget the name. I haven't done the interview yet.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.240]   I love the show. Thanks for doing it.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.600]   People should definitely check it out.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.360]   One thing I always ask everyone, because a lot of our listeners love to travel,
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.200]   is pick a place you're pretty familiar with.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.760]   Someone's in town there.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.480]   Where should they go for a great meal?
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.840]   Maybe a drink and some unusual thing to do to spend an afternoon?
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   Well, that's fun.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.240]   I mean, I live in New York and my hack for New York is just walk around.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.480]   I don't know if that's too obvious to be a hack, but I love New York.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.160]   I love living here.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.560]   Even before the pandemic, I never really went to the theater, didn't go to anything.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.040]   I just like being in New York.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.120]   I just like walking around.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.200]   Just get on the subway, walk around downtown, just enjoy.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.480]   It's free. Eat anywhere.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   It doesn't matter. Eat at a cart. Just be in the street.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.000]   So, that's one. I don't know if that's weak or not.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.640]   The other one that came to mind, I grew up in San Diego.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.000]   And my favorite place to eat in San Diego is a taco shop called Roberto's,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.720]   which is just like super low-key, cheap taco shop.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.920]   There's several of them.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.400]   My favorite one is in Del Mar.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.840]   And it's just a little taco shop near the beach, near Torrey Pines is the name of the beach.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.400]   But just go there and get whatever you want.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.200]   Get a carne asada burrito if you want to get one, sort of mild classic.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.120]   But get whatever you want.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.560]   You sit out on the deck and you have a view of the ocean.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.080]   It's cheap. It's delicious.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.040]   The beach is right there. You can go jump in the ocean.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.640]   There's an incredible state park, Torrey Pines State Park,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.040]   with these beautiful bluffs out over the ocean.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.200]   You can hike there. Maybe you'll see a dolphin.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.440]   You see the ocean. It's amazing.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.040]   That's exactly the kind of recommendation people love.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.000]   Thank you.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.480]   Roberto's. Torrey Pines, Del Mar.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.080]   Any other place people should find you online before we wrap?
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.560]   I spend too much time on Twitter.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.040]   I'm @JacobGoldstein.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.160]   If you ask me a question there, I'll see it and answer it if it's nice.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.120]   Awesome, Jacob, thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.320]   It was a delight. Thanks for having me.
