[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Well, welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.240]   We are gonna talk about books today.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.760]   John Piper's next book launch is worth having on your radar.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.200]   The book is titled Providence,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.680]   a 750-page book releasing in less than two months
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600]   on January 12th of next year.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   We mention it today because starting today,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.940]   you can pre-order the title from our friends
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.980]   at Westminster Books for just $19.99.

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.200]   as you consider supporting
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.560]   faithful, independent Christian booksellers.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.080]   To do that, go to wtsbooks.com.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.560]   That's wtsbooks.com,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.540]   and there you can pre-order Providence.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.840]   Pastor John, the release of your next book, Providence,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.520]   is about eight weeks away now.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.360]   I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.280]   This is a really big and important and relevant book
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.100]   for 2020 and whatever is to come in the year ahead.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.040]   Today, I have just a handful of questions
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   to pose to you about the book,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.440]   and we're gonna start with the title.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.720]   Explain the title.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   Why did you title this book Providence and not Sovereignty?
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.480]   - Well, that's an important question
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.320]   for a bunch of reasons,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.260]   but one interesting one is that the word providence
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.960]   doesn't even occur in the Bible,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   so people might say, "What's this?
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.040]   "700 pages on something that's not in the Bible."
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.440]   Well, no, that's not accurate.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.000]   Something that's not in the Bible.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.080]   That's not what I said.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.760]   I said the word is not in the Bible,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.200]   but neither is the word sovereignty in the Bible.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   Sovereignty is in like three places,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.720]   just like the word trinity, discipleship, evangelism,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.640]   exposition, counseling, ethics, politics, charismatics.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   None of those words is in the Bible.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.720]   I don't, in a sense, care ultimately about words.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.160]   I care about words.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.280]   I write, good grief, but I don't care.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680]   Ultimately, I care about reality.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   So the reason I'm focusing on providence
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960]   and not just sovereignty is because sovereignty refers
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   to God's right and power to do whatever He wills to do.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.480]   In that sense, of course, it's true.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.160]   God is sovereign,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   but I'm writing about God's purposeful sovereignty,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320]   not just His sovereignty.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.960]   In other words, this book is not just about
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440]   whether God has the right and the power
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   to do what He wills, but His purposeful sovereignty.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   What is His sovereignty doing in creation,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.840]   history, redemption, consummation of all things?
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.880]   That's what I'm about in this book.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   That's why the word providence and the reality of providence,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.640]   that is, purposeful sovereignty, is front and center.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.480]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   The sum of all God's sovereign acts
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   amounts to His providence.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.560]   - The sum of them and where they're going, their purpose.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   I did not expect to write the last third of this book,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.840]   which is all about God's providence in making His people,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.680]   the bride, what she ought to be.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.240]   I thought it was gonna be mainly about the big issues
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   of suffering in the world and war and pandemic
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.960]   and down to the nitty gritty things
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   of whether birds fall out of trees because of providence.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120]   But it came clear to me, well, what's it all about?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   It's about Christ purifying for Himself a bride
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   that He will enjoy in her enjoyment of Him forever.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.080]   - So good.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   It's a huge and detailed study.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000]   By my unofficial count,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.720]   I have over 3,000 Bible citations in it.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.560]   Why 3,000 Bible citations?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.800]   - I had no idea.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.720]   When you told me that number,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.960]   I had no idea that that number would be there.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   It makes me so happy.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.520]   I want to jump up and down.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.920]   Here's the reason, because John Piper's opinion,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.780]   based on no authority but his own, is not worth a penny.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.360]   Nobody should care what I think about anything
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.120]   or what you think, Tony.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.960]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.400]   - Or what anybody else thinks,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.080]   no matter how many degrees are behind their names.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   Unless it becomes evident that what you think
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.240]   or they think or I think is warranted
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.920]   by a trustworthy source of knowledge.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   There is only one infallible source of knowledge about God,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.120]   namely God.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.780]   If God did not reveal to us what He's like
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.720]   and what He's up to, we wouldn't know.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.760]   He points to what He's like,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.280]   what He's up to in the natural world,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   creation, natural revelation,
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.800]   but in the Bible, His inspired word.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.160]   He doesn't just point.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.880]   He declares, He describes, He explains,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.360]   and He applies what He is like and what He is doing.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.320]   A book on providence without the Bible
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.880]   would either be very, very short
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.060]   or very, very speculative.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.220]   In fact, most of them are.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.020]   Which leads me just to say one more quick thing
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.260]   on the issue of 3,000 Bible citations.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.340]   This is not an engagement.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.380]   The 700 pages is not an engagement
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.260]   with philosophical treatments on providence.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.740]   I'm not a philosopher.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.900]   I am a Bible reader.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.420]   I'm a Bible interpreter.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.260]   I'm a Bible herald.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.900]   I'm a Bible applier.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.980]   That's my calling.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.900]   That's my job.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.340]   That's my joy.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.180]   My stance with regard to philosophy
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.700]   is not at all to reject it,
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.580]   but to say that philosophical reflection
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.140]   on the providence of God
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.180]   will have very little possibility of fruitful outcomes
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.180]   unless the philosopher is more or less saturated
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.100]   with the Bible, like 3,000 Bible citations
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.780]   that give God's perspective on providence.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.900]   - That's good, yeah.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.700]   So 3,000 Bible citations that let God speak
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.540]   about providence Himself.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.700]   But the book is also 200,000 words long.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.120]   That's about 750 pages in print.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.300]   This is your longest solo book project by a wide margin.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.660]   So why so big?
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.020]   Why such a big book?
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.020]   - Yeah, I know most people don't read 700-page books.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.220]   The longer a book gets, the fewer people read it.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.220]   So Piper, why are you shooting yourself in the foot
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.940]   like this, or maybe the leg?
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.720]   But a few people do.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.180]   And the people who do tend to be people
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.740]   who influence others.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.740]   And I hope the scope, the comprehensiveness of the book
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.820]   will make it more compelling
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.220]   because of being more comprehensive.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.540]   Here's one other thing to say about what I'm thinking
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.640]   with the size of the book.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.240]   'Cause I planned for 30 years.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.140]   I mean, you've heard me say for decades,
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.660]   "I wanna write a big book on sovereignty someday,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.460]   "or a big book on providence."
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.820]   Well, it's done.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.300]   But here's the other thing to say.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.220]   Even though many people don't read
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.180]   the entirety of 700-page books,
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.860]   they love the Bible, and they are glad
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.940]   somebody gathered most of the parts of the Bible
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.620]   that relate to providence into one place
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.940]   and gave some reflection on them.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.140]   And they like having that book on their shelf
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.700]   so that they can pull it down,
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.820]   look for a relevant chapter to the lesson
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.300]   they're gonna be teaching,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.700]   or a particular text they're struggling with,
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.560]   get it in the index, go find it,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.220]   read the few pages on either side.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.220]   In other words, I hope the book will be a go-to resource,
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.580]   even for those who don't read it cover to cover.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.420]   - That's good.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.460]   Yeah, it's a reference book for all of life.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.820]   Something to have close at hand for the years ahead.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.980]   This book is, it's so fitting for 2020.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.300]   It feels relevant for this year.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.940]   But you began writing this book in the summer of 2018.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.580]   You had a 12-week writing leave in Knoxville,
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.800]   and then you finished it up in 2019.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.660]   So you wrote this book before 2020,
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.540]   meaning you wrote it before the pandemic.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.860]   You wrote it before the Minneapolis protests and riots.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.800]   So much has happened since you finished this book.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.240]   What does the book offer us today?
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.080]   Why now?
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.720]   What makes this relevant for this moment?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.320]   - Well, when I think of why now,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.960]   I am back on my heels with wonder
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.440]   here as we're recording in the middle of,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.320]   or I hope toward the end of, a pandemic,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.000]   that God would have positioned this book
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.920]   to come out in this season
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   because it is about the kinds of beauties and horrors
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.980]   that we taste every day.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.040]   I mean, even in the worst of times,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.060]   there are beauties in the best of times.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.220]   There are horrors, and that's what the Bible is.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.000]   It is full of beauties and full of horrors.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.560]   And God has something to say about all of them.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.240]   But when I mainly,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   when I think, why did you write this book now?
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   Here's really the answer,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.680]   'cause it was before all this came down.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   Because at the beginning of my eighth decade,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   I thought, maybe now I have tasted enough sorrow
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.480]   in the world and in my life to write with some,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   I hope, measure of wisdom about serious joy.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.100]   Second, I thought,
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.280]   well, I hope at the beginning of my eighth decade,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.800]   I have ruminated long enough
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.040]   on the paradoxes of reality and Scripture
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   so as to treat the varied emphases of the Bible
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   with some mature sense of proportion.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.520]   And after 50 years of reflection on the truth,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.880]   the all-pervasive importance of Christian hedonism,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.800]   namely that God is most glorified in us
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.200]   when we're most satisfied in Him,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.880]   I finally felt like I had come to a place
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.320]   in my eighth decade where I could show
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.360]   how this truth, this reality,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.120]   is woven into everything, absolutely everything.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.880]   Christian hedonism is not a cute,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.560]   marginal trick of linguistic interest
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.240]   on the margins of our theology.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.880]   It is in the essence of what God is doing
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.600]   everywhere all the time.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.700]   And maybe one last thing about why now?
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.900]   Why wait so long and do it now?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   As they say, I am walking the verge of Jordan.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.240]   I can smell the fields of eternity
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.660]   across the river from where I stand.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.460]   So even though I remain fallible, finite, sinful,
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.520]   it's either now or never, Tony.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.000]   And I think it was God's will two years ago
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.920]   that it be now rather than never.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.360]   - That's good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   The book is now getting translated into Arabic,
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   French, Russian, Chinese, German, Dutch,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.840]   Portuguese, Spanish, and Korean.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.040]   Why such a concerted effort to do major translations
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.880]   of this book and other books of yours?
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.000]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.920]   This is more important to me now than ever,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   that desiring God and my life count globally.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.800]   Across ethnicities, across races,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.720]   across nationalities, across languages, across cultures,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   God does not endorse or encourage any kind
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:39.000]   of nationalistic or ethnocentric focus in his people.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.440]   We belong to his kingdom first and foremost.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.560]   That shapes everything.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   He is pursuing all the nations and all the peoples
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.200]   and all the languages, all the cultures of the world.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.280]   And I want my life to count for the world,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.080]   not just for my national or my ethnic or my geographic
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.600]   or my cultural tribe,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.120]   but really the simple, straightforward answer
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.020]   for why so many translations?
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.280]   Why try to get it into many different cultures?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.400]   The answer is that the reality of providence
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.640]   is not culturally limited.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.200]   It is absolutely true in every language group,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.880]   in every culture in the world.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.700]   - Yeah, we need to finish this episode up,
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.720]   but what are your hopes and dreams and prayers
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.680]   for the Providence book?
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.360]   - I pray that Christians all over the world
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.040]   will become God-entranced people.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Yes, from a little dead baby squirrel
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.920]   on the sidewalk outside my house
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.500]   to the courses of the stars in the heavens
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.160]   and every beauty and every horror in between,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.460]   from the tiniest to the most magnificent,
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.460]   all of it, all of it related properly to God,
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.480]   suffused with God, entranced with God.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.660]   I think the doctrine of providence,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.660]   the reality of providence is one of the great keys
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.700]   for helping people become God-entranced people.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   And I pray that God's purposeful, gracious,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.180]   all-wise, all-pervasive sovereignty,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.360]   that is his providence,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.100]   would put steel into the backbone of Christians
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.500]   in our all-embracing obedience to Christ
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.580]   and our witness for Christ globally,
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.180]   so that tens of thousands of missionaries
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.420]   would be sent to the remaining work to be done
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.300]   in the unreached peoples of the world,
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.200]   and so that all of us, all of us,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.420]   whether we go or whether we send,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.340]   that all of us would be prevented
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.900]   from simply treating Christ and his saving purposes
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.600]   as something marginal to our lives
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.260]   instead of being the all-shaping, all-transforming,
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.200]   all-influencing reality that it's meant to be
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.380]   in the providence of God.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.040]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.920]   Well, this week, the book pre-orders go live,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.480]   and this week we are releasing two recordings
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.560]   that you've made, Pastor John, of the book.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.200]   You've read the introduction
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.880]   and you've read the conclusion of the book.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.360]   You've read them as audio book excerpts
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   for the APJ audience,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.520]   and those episodes will go up on Wednesday
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.240]   and Friday of this week, respectively,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.180]   so that you APJ listeners can get the first sneak peek
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.760]   of that intro and the conclusion from Pastor John himself.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.740]   It's rather doubtful that he will have the luxury
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.600]   to read the entire book himself,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.080]   but he has recorded these two important parts
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.840]   for us coming up later in the week.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.360]   And remember, you can support faithful,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.600]   independent Christian booksellers
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.760]   as you pre-order the Providence book.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.400]   Head over to WTSBooks.com, that's WTSBooks.com,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.820]   and you can pre-order the book today
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.020]   for a discounted price of just $19.99 per copy.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.040]   And of course, whenever we talk about books and pricing,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.960]   it's worth putting a little footnote here
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.160]   that if you're wondering where the book royalties go
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.700]   when John Piper sells a book,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.960]   he addressed that important question a few years back
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.040]   in a little video you can find at DesiringGod.org,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.440]   and that video is titled,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.740]   Million Sold, No Money Taken.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.080]   Million Sold, No Money Taken.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.520]   I'm Tony Reinke, thank you for listening,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.760]   and we'll see you on Wednesday
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.820]   for the introduction to the Providence book.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
