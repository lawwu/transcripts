[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   We have an email here from a mom named Colleen, who is writing on behalf of her son.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.760]   And for the sake of anonymity of him as a minor, I'm not going to use his name here.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.640]   Colleen, his mother, writes him to ask this.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.600]   "Dear Pastor John, I am hoping you can help us with regards to the topic of God
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880]   being a megalomaniac, which is what our 15-year-old son currently believes.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.760]   We've talked about this, and he has said that you may be the only person who can change his
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.040]   thinking on this. Because of the Westminster Catechism's answer to the chief end of man,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   he now believes that God is somehow weak and has an enormous ego, that he created human beings so
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.680]   that they will worship him, that God is too needy. My son wants to enjoy other things more than God,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.160]   and thinks that programming people to find their greatest happiness in worshiping him
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.040]   is coercive, mean, manipulative, and wrong. Pastor John, what would you say to this mom and to her son?"
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.160]   I don't know Colleen's son's name, but for convenience sake, I'm going to call him
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   Joe and speak directly to him. According to his mom, Joe believes six things.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.120]   What she doesn't say, and if I were having a conversation with Joe, the first thing I would
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:36.000]   ask is probably, "Now, what are you basing your view of God on? Are you making it up? Are you
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.360]   trusting some human teacher? Are you deducing it from nature and the logical use of nature?
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.880]   Or are you basing it on God's Word in Scripture?" And how he answers that question would probably
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.000]   affect how I answer. But since I don't know, I'm just going to rest my case with God's Word,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.480]   since I regard all those other sources as very unlikely sources of reliable information about
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.600]   infinite reality, especially my own head. I think if we are going to know anything about God for
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   sure, God has to tell us. There's no other way to know and show us, both from the Word and the
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.000]   Spirit's opening our hearts to see what's really there. So let me say a word about the six things
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   that I see Joe apparently believes about God. Number one, God is somehow weak. According to
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.240]   Scripture, "Great is our God and abundant in power," Joe. He is abundant in power. His understanding
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   is beyond measure, Psalm 147.5. "The Almighty, we cannot find Him. He is great in power," Job 37.23.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   In fact, Job comes to the end of his book with this overriding conviction. "I know that you,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:24.480]   O God, can do all things, and no purpose of yours can be thwarted," Job 42.2. Isaiah 46,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.440]   God himself puts it like this, "I am God, and there is no other. I am God, and there is none
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.800]   like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things not yet done, saying,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.'" So no, Joe, God is not weak. He is
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   infinitely powerful. He upholds the universe by the Word of His power. He holds you in being
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.840]   moment by moment. If He stopped thinking about you, you would vanish out of existence.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.600]   Number two, Joe says God has an enormous ego. The problem with that statement is that the
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.720]   connotation of the word "ego" is that his head is swollen beyond what it should be,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.960]   or he's too big for his britches, or he's posturing and posing to get people to think
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.360]   he's greater than he is, or that there's a void inside his big, boasting head that desperately
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.280]   needs filling from others who can give him what he lacks, and so he's always trying to make up
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   for some deficiency from the contributions of others. That's the way we talk about big ego.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:02.000]   But all of those connotations are sinful. They're ugly. The Bible never portrays God in any of those
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.280]   sinful ways. None of those connotations about God's self-exaltation are in the Bible. None of them.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.160]   None of those connotations is true of Him. The Lord is good and upright in all His ways, Psalm
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.360]   25.8. The Lord is good. His steadfast love endures forever in His faithfulness to all generations,
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:35.520]   Psalm 100, verse 5. Joe, you seem to have decided to use this derogatory language
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:45.920]   about God because of this next thing you believe, and this is true. So the third thing
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.520]   is God created humans so that they will worship Him. That's true. That's absolutely true.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.000]   "Bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone whom I called by
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made." And Jesus in John 4.23 says,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:20.080]   "God is seeking worshippers in spirit and in truth." In Ephesians 1.5, "He predestined us for
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.960]   adoption for Himself as sons through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of His will." Why? "To
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:37.600]   the praise of the glory of His grace." So, Joe, it sounds like you're asking,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:49.040]   "If it is ugly and sinful for me to act like that, how can I admire a God who acts that way?"
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.520]   That's a very good question, and here's the reason that you dare not seek people's worship,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:07.120]   and God should and must. If I say to a crowd, "Puny, puny John Piper, sinful John Piper,"
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:14.480]   if I say to a crowd, "I came tonight so that you would all see my beauty and find your greatest
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:27.360]   happiness in me," if I believed that and said that, I would not be loving, because, one, I'd be wrong.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.360]   I am not where your greatest happiness can be found. I am emphatically not where your greatest
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.960]   happiness can be found. And number two, I would be unloving because I would be distracting you
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:54.000]   from the one whose beauty can make you supremely happy and satisfied, namely God and all that He is
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.360]   for us in Christ. But if God were to come into the room tonight and say to the crowd, "I came tonight
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:14.800]   so that you would see and know my divine beauty and find your greatest happiness in me,"
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   He would not be unloving because, one, it is true. He is the only source of deep and longest
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   happiness. Psalm 1611, "In your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   forevermore." And two, He would not be distracting us from what would make us deeply and permanently
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:50.480]   happy. He would be giving us the surest way to joy, namely offering us Himself. Now, Joe, add this.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:59.520]   This is crucial. Hear this. God did not just come into the room or the world and say, "Here I am
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:08.480]   for your enjoyment." He came to people who hated Him. He came to people who rejected Him, who
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:21.440]   belittled Him, who called Him an egomaniac. And He died for us. He died for us. That is not weak.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:30.240]   It's not needy. It's not what egomaniacs do. They don't die for their enemies out of love.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.400]   Strength to suffer for His enemies and bring them to eternal happiness in worshiping Him,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:48.320]   that's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful strength. It is the most beautiful strength in the universe
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:56.800]   that was shown at Calvary for sinners like you, Joe, and me. And the fourth thing you say is that
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:06.240]   He's too needy. No, He's not needy. He's not needy at all. That's not coming out of the Bible. It's
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   not coming out of reason. It's coming out of unreason. Acts 17, 25, "God is not served by
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.320]   human hands as though He needed anything, because He Himself gives to all men life and breath and
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.400]   everything. God does not need us. If He were hungry, He would not tell us." Psalm 50 says,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   "God is seeking our worship not because He needs it, not because it meets a need, but because it
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:46.960]   meets our need." We were madeâ€”we've got this big God-shaped vacuum in our hearts. We were made to
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:57.440]   enjoy God, know God, love God, serve God, worship God. That is, to enjoy to the max and to overflow
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   with admiration what is most admirable. And, Joe, I hope you take it right. God is stuck
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:16.800]   with being God. He didn't choose to be beautiful. He is. He is absolutely who He is. I am who I am.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.120]   He said. And the only question God has is not whether to be beautiful and all-satisfying.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:33.600]   The question is whether He's going to share it and then die for it. And then, Joe, says it seems
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:43.520]   God's programming people to find their greatest happiness in worshiping Him is coercive, mean,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   manipulative, and wrong. There are two problems with this, Joe. One is that God's way of bringing
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:57.280]   people to worship Him is not programming. It's not programmed, because that implies computerized
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:04.720]   robots with no moral will and no soul, which we have, and it's a mystery of great proportion. So,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:12.320]   God is not manipulative, not manipulative. He's not coercive. And the other problem is that it
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.520]   cannot be mean, it cannot be mean to bring a person to their greatest happiness.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:29.840]   If it really is our greatest happiness, then you and I, Joe, would never want to leave it,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.880]   not in a million years for anything. Which leaves us, Joe, with this question.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.640]   Is your indictment of God not based mainly on good evidence from His Word,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   but on the fact that you don't like it, and you want very much to be free to enjoy other things
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:03.120]   more than God? If that's true, I pray and I hope I ask you, reconsider. Every pleasure that isn't
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:12.160]   rooted in God will fail you. Your heart was made to find greatest and longest happiness in God.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:21.120]   If sin keeps you from supreme joy in God, sin needs to go, not God.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.600]   21 Absolutely critical and central to everything that we do. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.880]   I'm going to be meditating on that line for a long time. God seeks our worship not because it
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   meets His need, but because it meets our need. That is profound. Thank you, Pastor John. Thanks
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.000]   for the question, Colleen. I hope this episode serves your son in a profound way. Thank you for
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320]   listening and making the podcast part of your day and commute. It's an honor to tag along with you
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.840]   as part of your day. We are humbled to be brought into some of the deepest struggles that you face
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.880]   in your families. Three times a week, we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.520]   even search our past episodes in our archive and reach us by email with a question you may be facing
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.880]   in inside of your own home. You can do all that through our online home at
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:14.800]   DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. Well, when we return, I believe we're going to hear from a
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.360]   woman who finds herself jaded by the constant turnover in her local church and she's tired
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.960]   of making new friends as people come in and leave the church that she attends.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.520]   I may be wrong. It may be another topic, but I think that's coming up. If not, it's coming up
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.240]   in the near future. In any case, we will be back on Friday. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.040]   Thanks for listening.
