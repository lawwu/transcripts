[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   "Do you have any book recommendations aside from your own
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.340]   "that will compliment cultivating a deep life
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.480]   "outside of work?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.420]   "So far from the past, I've heard you talk about Walden
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.560]   "and designing your life.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.900]   "I'd love to hear more you consider good reading
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.460]   "before you release your next book,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.100]   "which is the 'Deep Life' book."
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.980]   So Mark, I want you to read nothing
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.760]   until my book on the deep life comes out.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.380]   Everything else compared to my book is garbage.
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.300]   No, there's a lot of good books.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.460]   So I'm gonna zig here, right?
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.460]   There's two ways of thinking about books
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.640]   about the deep life.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.620]   There's books you can imagine
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.700]   to be actually instructive, right?
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.220]   So like "Designing Your Life"
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.120]   or Tim Ferriss' like the four-hour work week, right?
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.300]   What's the Arthur Brooks book?
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.540]   We had Arthur on his book with Oprah,
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.860]   you know, building the life you want.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.020]   So you have straight up instructive books.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.540]   My book on the deep life will fall
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.560]   into that instructive bucket.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.020]   Like here's the way to think about this.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.340]   Here's what to do, try this out.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.500]   But I'm gonna recommend something different for you now.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.820]   So the other piece about reading about the deep life
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.860]   is not the instructions
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.260]   about how you construct a deep life,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.660]   but instead your internal exploration
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.960]   to understand what the deep life means to you.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.260]   Like what is depth?
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.620]   This is actually the big question that people have.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620]   Now, you know, on the show we say,
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.620]   first of all, life is too ambiguous of a term.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.460]   Break your life into the different areas
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.300]   that are important to you.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.840]   We sometimes call these buckets.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.360]   So let's do that first.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.100]   And, you know, so you might have craft and community
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.560]   and constitution and contemplation, celebration.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.860]   At different ways we talk about this,
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.940]   but the areas of your life that's important to you.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.860]   So now life is something more general.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.160]   Then what you wanna do is seek out
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.440]   in each of these areas of your life,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   examples that resonate.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.920]   So it could be something you read about.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   It could be something you hear on a podcast
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.760]   or something you see in a movie or a documentary
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   or read in a magazine article,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.240]   but you're trusting your own body's intuition.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.520]   You're using your body as a depth detector.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.360]   It knows.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.280]   Like if it sees something that feels right
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040]   in some way to me, I'm gonna feel that.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.560]   And so you start to capture these examples.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.040]   And then once you have these examples
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.200]   and you're categorizing them,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.080]   like the different parts of your life.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.420]   Once you have these examples,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.960]   then you can distill them into properties.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.480]   Oh, so what are the properties
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.720]   that these examples have?
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.560]   Let me distill those.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.060]   These are the properties I'm looking for
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000]   in the working part of my life.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.080]   These are what resonate to me.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.300]   I've distilled at the properties.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.100]   Here's the properties I'm looking for
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.320]   in the community aspect of my life.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.700]   I had these sort of examples of people and things
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.440]   and these books I read that really spoke to me.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.020]   What are the properties they all shared
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.820]   that I want in the community part of my life?
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.120]   Once you have those properties,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320]   now you have a portrait of your own goal as a deep life
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   that you can start working on pursuing.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.360]   And that's gonna be sort of fundamental
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.160]   to the book I'm writing on the deep life,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040]   the sort of lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   So with this in mind, though,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240]   this means this is another way to think about books
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.960]   is you're looking for things that resonate.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.420]   Then you're recording the things that resonate
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.840]   under the right categories,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.640]   and then later you try to distill properties out of them.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.540]   So you don't necessarily need
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.140]   to just be looking for instructions,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.600]   but instead the raw material you'll later need
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   to construct a deep life.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.000]   So Mark, that's what I might recommend.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.920]   Read things that speak to you.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.000]   And when you get that feeling of like,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.360]   whatever this person is doing,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.240]   why I'm reading a book about Lincoln
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.520]   and something about Lincoln is resonating with me,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   what's happening with the way he's dealing with X,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.880]   let me write that down.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.080]   I'm watching a documentary about Laird Hamilton,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.420]   big wave surfing on the North Shore of Maui.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.180]   I don't know what about this is resonating,
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.380]   but something is, I'm gonna write this down.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.600]   So think about books in that way
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.900]   as a source of intuition into what matters to you.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.080]   And then of course we can later use that information
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.280]   to help construct a life that has those properties in it.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.200]   And that's the whole lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.040]   it's its own thing.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.280]   But anyways, I wanted to make that distinction.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   Books and the deep life is not just about
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.500]   how do I build this, but it's what do I wanna build,
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.440]   discovering what it is you wanna build.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.700]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.680]   - Next question's from Scott.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.080]   Do you think handwriting has a positive effect
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   on cultivating a deep life?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   He provides a link that we'll take a look at.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.120]   He also goes on to say, you use your remarkable tablet
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.000]   and that implies that you like writing by hand.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   Do you use it for reasons suggested in the article?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.280]   - All right, Scott, so we loaded up
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.800]   the article you sent to us.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160]   I'll put it on the screen here for people who are watching
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.640]   instead of just listening.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   So the article that Scott sent us is titled
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   Why Handwriting is Good for Your Brain.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   It's a picture of someone writing
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.240]   at some sort of colonial-looking desk.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.360]   All right, analysis.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.520]   Research over the years has pointed out
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.920]   that there are many advantages and benefits
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.240]   to writing by hand.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.600]   All right, so there's some cool pictures in here.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   I'm just kind of scrolling through this thing.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.140]   Look at that thing.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.520]   This is like a writing device, Jesse,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.560]   this weird thing here.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.280]   It's a writing device that Nietzsche used.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.120]   Okay.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.320]   In a study carried out almost two decades ago,
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.920]   subjects were presented with words
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.160]   carrying a positive connotation,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.720]   such as sweet, or negative, such as rubbish.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.280]   Subjects had to indicate whether a word was good or bad
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   by moving a joystick.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.080]   Half the subjects were told to indicate
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.960]   that a word was good by pulling the joystick
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.800]   towards their body,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.400]   and the other half were told to indicate good
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.620]   by pushing it away.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.680]   To indicate that a word was bad,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.480]   they made the opposite movement to good.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.220]   A consistent correlation was observed
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.980]   between meaning and movement.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.580]   The quickest responses were produced
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.380]   by the subjects who were told to indicate good
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.160]   by pulling the joystick towards themselves,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.760]   and indicate bad by pushing it away.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   The direct involvement of the body and senses
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.160]   and mental processes can explain how writing by hand
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.940]   helps us learn letters and words.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.160]   This is backed up by the results of various studies,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.000]   which they then go on to summarize.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.220]   All right, well, it's a good question.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.200]   Do I use a remarkable notebook
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.560]   specifically to get benefits of handwriting?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.540]   Not really.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.540]   Not really.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.320]   There's two advantages I like to it.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.160]   Portability.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.120]   Handwriting is portable.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   You just need a surface, right?
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.640]   Keyboards take space,
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.200]   and I can type much faster than I can write.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.760]   I mean, I take a lot of notes on my computer typing,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.640]   so I can type much faster than I can write,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   but it's not portable.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.440]   So I like portability of handwriting.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.280]   I also like flexibility of formatting.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.480]   So in my remarkable, I underline things,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.580]   I draw boxes, I draw arrows.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.080]   There's a lot of information
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.240]   that can be captured diagrammatically, right?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.200]   Like I can draw things, captures information.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.560]   I can underline things, box things,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.880]   connect things with arrows.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.080]   There's a lot of extra information you can add
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.040]   with drawing in addition to just pure text.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.460]   So I like both those things about handwriting.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.880]   I don't know that I understand
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.760]   or remember information better when I write.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.980]   I'm frustrated that my writing is slow
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.020]   compared to my typing.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.000]   My handwriting tends to get sloppy.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.480]   Usually when I'm typing, just because my speed is better,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.840]   I can get out more ideas.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.240]   I can develop them better.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.580]   I mean, I actually like typed thinking,
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.760]   I feel like is more flexible for me than writing speaking,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.400]   but there's advantages to the handwriting,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.920]   the portability and the ability to add diagrams.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   So I'm not a big booster of these notions
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.760]   that it will change my understanding
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   if I write it as opposed to type it.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   In my book, I talked about this, I'm remembering this now.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.280]   I talked about this in my straight A student book
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.200]   from years ago about how to be a student.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.440]   And I argued in that book like,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.080]   hey, if you're able to bring a laptop,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.600]   if you have a laptop and are able to bring a laptop
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.800]   in the class to take notes,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.920]   that's probably better because you can type faster.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.840]   To me, it was all about keeping up,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.960]   getting the information down
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.640]   that you can then later study from.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.280]   And so I think from, if I'm thinking back,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.200]   even from my early days, I was a big fan of speed,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   speed and efficiency.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.000]   So I like typing, but I do handwrite
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.500]   because it has its advantages.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.020]   If I had better handwriting, Jesse, I would do it more.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.340]   Like some people have beautiful handwriting
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.620]   and there's like a draw, it's really nice.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.060]   They have these bullet journals that look very artistic.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.380]   My notebooks, if you looked at them,
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.180]   sort of look like you're capturing someone
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.060]   having a stroke in real time,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.580]   just in terms of like the handwriting and the,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.860]   so I get frustrated, like I wanna go faster.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.220]   - Other than your $50 notebook back in the day.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.900]   - That one I wrote carefully in, that one slowed me down.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.820]   - That was in the book.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.940]   - I get frustrated I can't type faster.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.820]   I type myself off of my keyboard.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.620]   I go so fast, I type myself off, I wanna go faster.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.700]   My thoughts move so much quicker
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.800]   than I can get information down, but that's true.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.100]   So in my high quality notebook,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.380]   which I talk about in slow productivity,
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.980]   I spent a lot of money on this notebook
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.020]   when I was a postdoc.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.660]   So I would take my thoughts more seriously.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.260]   My handwriting is very neat in there.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.180]   So I did go slower in that notebook
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.860]   and I did produce better ideas.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.620]   So maybe there's something in that.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.420]   - How's your keyboard holding up
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.900]   that you bought over the holiday season?
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.540]   - I like it, my Mechanical.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.380]   - Yeah.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.540]   - Yeah, so by bouncing up the fingers,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180]   I'm faster, I can type faster.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.740]   But I still type myself off that keyboard.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.820]   I go faster than I can actually keep up.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.060]   - So you still use it all the time?
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.900]   - All the time.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.820]   - Yeah.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.940]   - Even in the HQ, when I use our new
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.060]   sort of beastly studio computer setup,
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.780]   I'll bring my Mechanical and plug it in.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.540]   Yeah, I really do like writing on it.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.380]   - That's cool.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.180]   All right, next question's from Josh.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.740]   I have struggled with learning in school
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.500]   and work my whole life.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.780]   I struggle with comprehension
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.700]   and my analytical and communication skills are terrible.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.900]   I'm 33 and this inability to move up in life
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.580]   and grow is affecting every aspect of my life.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.940]   I feel like I'm always working hard to no avail.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.300]   Should I get a brain scan to prove I have a low IQ?
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.580]   - No, I don't think you need to measure your IQ.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.820]   I don't think you need a brain scan.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.340]   You know, I think what we need to do here
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.860]   is lifestyle-centric planning, all right?
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.380]   So this is like my key idea about the deep life
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.100]   is instead of fixating on particular specific goals
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.180]   that are appealing to you
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.220]   and hoping that those goals, if accomplished,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.500]   will bring in their wake and appealing lifestyle,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.780]   focus directly on the lifestyle that's appealing to you
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.260]   and see how do I engineer it.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.860]   When you focus on the aspects of your lifestyle
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.260]   that are appealing to you first and work backwards,
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.540]   it opens up many more ways forward.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.980]   You have a huge diversity of ways forward
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.340]   and most importantly, you can mix and match
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.580]   your ways forward towards this desirable lifestyle
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.580]   to actually conform to your opportunities and obstacles
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.140]   which are very specific to you.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.100]   So I think lifestyle-centric plans
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.940]   is what's gonna be good here
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.220]   because I think in your mind,
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.140]   it sounds like you probably have these particular goals.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.020]   I don't know, I wanna be higher up in this job
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.820]   or I wanna make this much money in this role
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.460]   and there's obstacles to it.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.140]   You're like, I'm having a hard time getting there.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.900]   Whereas in lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.780]   you say, well, what do I want?
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.060]   What do I actually want in the different parts of my life?
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.300]   It's not the specific job.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.980]   It's that I wanna have this type of security
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.900]   and live in this type of place
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.220]   and have this sort of engagement with the community
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.540]   and spend this type of time.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.660]   You build this image of your life.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.900]   And now you can say, what are my best ways to get there?
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.980]   So if like this particular type of work you're in,
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.580]   maybe it's involving certain types
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.380]   of like very stylized business communication
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.740]   and lots of like fast analytical thinking
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.180]   about analyzing things.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.220]   And if that is not fitting well with your skills,
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.180]   okay, let's find a different way
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.100]   to get towards what you're looking for.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.860]   The other thing you'll get out of lifestyle-centric planning
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.740]   is now you're working with your opportunities and obstacles.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.420]   You can sort of work systematically
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.660]   to expand opportunities and reduce the obstacles.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.100]   So if you're having difficulty with, you know,
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.660]   reading comprehension, for example,
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.780]   there are things you can do to make that better.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.060]   Typically reading, building up a reading habit,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.860]   starting with books that are incredibly appealing and easy
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.660]   and then sort of slowly pushing yourself on the complexity.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.380]   That changes your mind.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.180]   As your mind becomes a reading mind, it changes it.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.660]   Spending a lot less time with really high distraction,
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.860]   high salient attention economy tools,
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.420]   like things on your phone.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.780]   Spend a lot less time with that
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.500]   and more times with slow information
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.260]   and slow entertainment like books,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.700]   like watching full movies.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.260]   That'll rewire your brain in a way that will help.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.500]   If there's particular analytical skills,
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.860]   practicing those skills will help.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.740]   I wanna actually practice doing this type of analysis,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.380]   getting feedback, doing it better next time.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.060]   So you can actually reduce obstacles
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.740]   and increase opportunities.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.980]   But all of this, I think, should be in the context
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.220]   of what do I want out of my life?
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.460]   Okay, what do I have available?
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.580]   What opportunities do I have available?
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.500]   What are my obstacles?
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.100]   How can I expand those, reduce those?
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.500]   Fine, but let me work with what I can do well
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.620]   and figure out how to get closer and closer
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.340]   to these properties in the various parts of my life
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.180]   that appeal to me.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.020]   So I think the flexibility of lifestyle-centric planning
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.340]   is critical here because otherwise you might lock in
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.780]   on this is what I need to do,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.620]   this job and this position and this job.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.220]   And if that's not working for you,
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   all you're gonna feel is frustration.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.580]   So that's what I would suggest there.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.140]   Lifestyle-centric planning, LCP.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.220]   You know me, LCP.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.060]   That's a good question.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.180]   All right, what else do we got?
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.420]   - All right, next question's from Esteban.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.620]   Do you recommend using ChatGPT for reading recommendations?
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.460]   - No.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.260]   I mean, ChatGPT has just digested a lot of information
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.260]   from people and then it is going to be remixing that
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.220]   in sort of arbitrary ways, unpredictable ways
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.620]   to try to produce a simulation
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.580]   of how real people it encountered online
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.860]   would be recommending books.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.180]   I think it's better just to go straight
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.660]   to the source material that ChatGPT trained on.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.740]   People whose taste you find interesting or congruent,
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.580]   what type of books are they recommending?
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.260]   Trusting your own intuition, right?
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.020]   Like what am I interested in right now?
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.660]   What are the parts of my life I want to understand better?
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.860]   What are the parts of the world that seem interesting to me
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.180]   that I want to know more about?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.460]   What are good books there?
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.340]   I feel like choosing nonfiction books,
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.780]   it's like this, especially nonfiction,
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.500]   it's this really subtle act.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.780]   You know, I'm constantly, it's a very subtle act
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.660]   when I'm choosing what I want to read next.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.860]   And a lot of different things in my life come together
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.660]   to choose this book versus that book
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.220]   and it's really enriching to me
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.300]   and even the selection process itself is an act
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.500]   of self-development, self-definition.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.500]   So there's certain things like, yeah, this is great.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.420]   We can use a language model to make faster.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.660]   This is not something we need to make faster.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.060]   The more you have to find and understand
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.780]   what you want to read and why you want to read it,
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.500]   as you get better at finding and making these selections,
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.020]   you are going to improve your own understanding of yourself.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.220]   So do not fall back on ChatGPT for this,
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.460]   because again, you're just getting, right,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.460]   it's a token generator.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.940]   So it's like, what would people
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.620]   that I've seen talking about books,
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.980]   what are the types of things they would say here?
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.060]   That's not going to be better
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.420]   than just actually going to people who talk about books
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.340]   and seeing what they're saying.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.020]   'Cause there you have a real mind
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.980]   with coherent agency on the other end of it
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.900]   that you can actually relate to as a human being
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.220]   and figure out how to place the recommendations
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.020]   into some sort of larger sociocultural context.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.300]   It's a very human thing.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.020]   I think it's something that's worth keeping more human.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.100]   Hey, if you liked this video,
