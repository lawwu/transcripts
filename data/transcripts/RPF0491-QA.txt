[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.520]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   Today live Q&A.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.280]   I've been doing a special series of live Q&A shows this week and we round out with our
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   third one.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.800]   This will be the last one for a little while that's open to the entire audience of the
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   show.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:26.200]   I usually restrict these Q&A calls to patrons of the show, those of you who find enough
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.160]   value in the show to financially support it.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   You can do that if you're interested in doing that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.

[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.640]   But this week I've been doing a special series of live Q&A shows.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640]   Super fun.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.200]   We can give interesting questions with people that we don't usually get to talk to.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.560]   So our first caller today is Karen in California.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.040]   Karen, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.400]   I'm calling because I'm trying to figure out for me and my husband what we should do
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   next with our finances.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   We're older, so I'm 46.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   He is 49.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.880]   But we've only been married about five and a half years.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.240]   But when I married him, we had a lot of student loans from his end.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.680]   And I really had to organize the finances for us.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.720]   And we were able to get on track.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.600]   And we actually paid it all off a couple months ago.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   It was $140,000 worth of student loans.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   We both had a career change, and so that's how the student loans came about.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.040]   But at this point, I'm trying to figure out with moving forward what we should do next.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   If we should just really focus on the retirement, or we should buy a home, or maybe we can do
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.440]   part of, like, you know, I know people have told me you can buy a home, and that could
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   be part of your retirement, too.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.920]   So I'm really not sure what to do because the finances are limited, but housing is very
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.040]   expensive here, and we also need to retire at some point.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000]   What's your household income?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360]   Right now, our household income is about $140,000.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.280]   Do you expect that to continue at $140,000, or do you expect any dramatic increases or
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   decreases?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.760]   It will probably stay about the same.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.000]   There might be some increases coming up over the years.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.360]   The income actually increased significantly just last year because I changed jobs.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.520]   So I think at this point, $140,000 is a good number, but then it might increase a little
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   bit every year.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   Okay.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.000]   And how much money do you guys have just in savings, non-retirement accounts, just money
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   that's available to you in bank accounts, things like that?
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.680]   We have $100,000.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.800]   And how much money in retirement accounts, IRAs, Roth IRAs, that type of thing?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.960]   It's $200,000.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.600]   And do you have any other major assets, a home somewhere else, any other major financial
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   assets?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   No.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.640]   I actually had a condo in Georgia, but I sold it, and that's where the cash came from.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   Great.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   And do you owe any money to anybody for any reason?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   No.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.480]   We only have a car loan of about $60,000.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   You broke up just a little bit.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   How much?
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   $16,000.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.280]   And how much is the car worth?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.640]   I don't know, actually.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   Probably about the same.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   Okay.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.600]   Well, conceptually, you're living in California.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.520]   Why would you choose to buy a house in California?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.960]   Well, because we're considering living here long-term, and the job market is very good
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.000]   for us.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.080]   Do you want to own a house?
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   Not necessarily, but it seems like the right thing to do.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.160]   Why?
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.240]   I don't know.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.640]   It seems like if I don't own something, the rent continues to grow.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.880]   And if we want to stay here, it only makes sense at some point to buy something.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.320]   Have you gone shopping for places to rent and/or places to buy?
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.840]   I've looked at what houses might be available to us to buy.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:51.680]   And, actually, with the amount that I – the mortgage I'm looking at, it's limited, but
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   possible in terms of housing that's available to buy.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.000]   So if you did buy a house, how much would it cost and how much would the house cost?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.480]   So I'm looking at all the houses.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.360]   Most of the houses in the market is about a million dollars, but there are houses that
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   are like $600,000 or $700,000.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.320]   So I'm looking at possibly if I can own something that's $500,000 to $600,000, that would be
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.920]   wonderful.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.640]   And how much – to rent the place that you're living now, how much are you paying each month
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   in rent?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.480]   So right now, rent is pretty fair.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:44.320]   It's about $1,800, but that's only because we started – we rented it about six years
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   ago.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.720]   So they can't really increase it too much every year, but the landlord has been increasing
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.960]   it every month – I mean, every year by about $150 each year, a month.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.600]   So I know at some point he might either try to kick us out or – because rental market
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.440]   is about, for my apartment, probably about $2,500.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.180]   Based upon where you're living now and the lifestyle associated with how you're living,
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.560]   are you and your husband happy?
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.720]   Yes.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.280]   Based on what you're describing, I don't see a whole lot of advantage to buying.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840]   Now, California real estate is very difficult.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   Let me just give you some things to think about because ultimately you're going to
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.200]   have to make these decisions obviously.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.280]   But California real estate is a unique animal.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.440]   Let's talk conceptually generally first.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.720]   Reasons to buy, reasons to rent.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.200]   It's my conviction.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.280]   I'm convinced generally that rentals are often going to be about the same financial
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:02.600]   results as owning a house, especially by the time you factor in the care and the maintenance
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.520]   of a place to live and et cetera.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.800]   Many landlords underprice their property.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.760]   Now, the problem is that has to be expressed locally.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.600]   It has to be looked at locally.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.480]   Sometimes you'll find that rents are very high.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.360]   Sometimes you'll find that rents are very low.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.120]   What you're describing to me, without knowing the exact properties involved, if you can
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.880]   rent a place that you're happy with for $1,800 or the alternative cost is to go and
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.280]   to buy a house that may cost you somewhere between $600,000 and a million dollars, if
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.760]   both of those bring you equal satisfaction in terms of lifestyle, no question, given
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.720]   that scenario, I would rent because there's just such a dramatic difference in your flexibility.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.160]   There's such a dramatic difference there and it sounds like you have an undermarket
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.260]   rent, which is helpful.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.400]   If your landlord is increasing your rents once a year, that's great.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.640]   That's exactly what they should be doing.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.000]   That's exactly how they should be reacting.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.760]   After all, the value of property all around has been increasing in recent years and that
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.080]   will – and it's only just and fair that the landlord should be able to increase your
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.560]   rents steadily.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   So you should keep an eye on the rental market locally for equivalent housing units and see
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.400]   am I getting a fair rent.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.920]   But it sounds like you have an undermarket rent.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.880]   If you're happy with that, there's no way in the world that you could own a house
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.360]   where the pure cost, ignoring any kind of investment options, there's no way in the
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.200]   world you could own a house with a $600,000 to a million-dollar price tag and have the
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.920]   pure cost of your taxes and your insurance and your just simple costs of acquisition,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.780]   et cetera, that would be anything less than $1,800 a month.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.480]   You would not be building equity just because you went on and took on a $2,500 or $3,000
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   a month mortgage payment.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.600]   Your pure cost will be more than your rental expense.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.760]   Now there may be a lifestyle difference.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.680]   For example, I don't know if those prices that you're quoting are related to the same
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.140]   kind of place that you're living now.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.580]   What happens often is when people move and especially when people buy, they often tend
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.320]   to buy more house than they would otherwise rent.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.900]   That's why I asked you the question about lifestyle satisfaction.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.040]   Given what you've described to me, sounds like rental is just probably conceptually
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   better.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.320]   It gives you more freedom, gives you more flexibility and it's going to have a lower
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.080]   net cost for you at this point in time.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.760]   Now with regard to California real estate, you could make an argument and say, "Well,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.180]   we're going to be here for the very, very long term.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.800]   The local job market is good to us in our careers.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.820]   We're going to be here for the very long term."
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.820]   I don't know enough about your local area to be confident in giving any kind of real
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   estate advice.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.200]   California real estate seems and feels to me, living on the other side of the country,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.880]   like it's a very heady market right now.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.840]   Now it's hard because real estate prices are supported by jobs and there are pockets in
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.240]   the California marketplace where there are very high incomes and there are very high
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.060]   wages and those very high incomes and very high wages push up real estate prices.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:17.480]   Those little pockets where high income earners live tend to have high real estate appreciation.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.680]   Now will that continue?
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.640]   I don't know and it's impossible for me to know but you would have to very carefully
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   assess that.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   In general, I'm personally from observationally the other side of the country, I would be
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.600]   pretty nervous about owning California real estate at this point in time based upon what
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.060]   I can see, not being a local.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.800]   So you would have to assess that.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.520]   Now let's talk conceptually because of the basic question you asked of retirement versus
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.200]   real estate.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.300]   Whatever you choose to do, you should probably focus on retirement and saving and investing
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.160]   for retirement.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.340]   Even if you do choose to buy a place to live, if I woke up in your shoes, I would probably
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:02.380]   put the minimal amount of money down on that property and I would focus on accumulating
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.880]   more investment assets at this point in time.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.120]   I wouldn't use a lot of money and I wouldn't use a lot of income to buy real estate and
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:17.960]   I think that you should be very careful to not change the asset allocation of your portfolio
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.600]   to be very heavy in real estate.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.240]   Realistically speaking, sounds like these career changes have been good for you.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.520]   But at this point in time, you don't have a ton of money compared to the amount of money
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.780]   that you're earning.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.680]   So these new earnings, you need to take some time and have them build up.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.120]   You have $100,000 in cash.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   That's probably a very decent amount to keep in cash.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   I wouldn't be concerned about having $50,000 to $70,000 as my emergency fund if I were
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.520]   living in California in your situation and I wouldn't be upset about having – keeping
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.640]   that other money around in case I did want to buy something, adjust something, move somewhere,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   etc.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.880]   So to me, having $100,000 of cash feels pretty good.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.080]   Now having $200,000 in retirement accounts means that you have some exposure to investment
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   assets.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.960]   If you were to go and to purchase a $600,000 or a million-dollar property, let's say
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   that you were to put 10% down on that property, you'll start to be heavily weighted towards
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.880]   real estate and I think this is a danger for you because the thing that would affect California
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.200]   real estate prices would be a change in employment.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.320]   If there were a change in wages, change in the economy that affect change in wages, stock
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.520]   bonuses went down, that would have an impact in time on the local California real estate
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.280]   market, would cause it to decline and that change in wages could affect you and your
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.060]   husband and your income and also affect your real estate.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.480]   This is one of the reasons why it's unwise for people to put so much money into their
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.840]   own personal real estate.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.660]   People are often so heavily weighted in personal real estate.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.880]   So for all these reasons, I like the idea of your building up a bigger investment portfolio.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.640]   I like the idea of your having more diversity and if you can live happily and rent for $1,800
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.120]   a month in a market where you would need to pay $600,000 to a million dollars to buy a
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.560]   place to live, I think I would personally, I'd be renting very happily.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   Okay.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:25.400]   So let's say the concern I have is that the rental market or the rent that I'm paying
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   may change very quickly.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   If it goes up significantly, would your thinking be different?
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.800]   You're asking a question about the future that is unknowable.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.980]   So here would be – that is a concern and that is one of the challenges of being a tenant.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.660]   It is possible that your landlord will adjust your rents relatively quickly.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.720]   Now what protection do you have from that?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.440]   Well, number one, you have a lease I would guess of some kind that probably can reset
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.340]   on an annual basis.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.040]   Number two, you have the local market and your landlord wants to be competitive in the
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.280]   local market.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.800]   And so there's going to be some reason why the local rental market is changing.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   Your landlord can't all of a sudden say, "I'm going to double your rent from $1,800
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.060]   a month to $3,600 a month and everything around costs $2,000 a month."
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.240]   You would move out and you'd find a different place.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.120]   So the only reason your landlord is adjusting the rent is going to be because in the local
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:32.600]   base and local area, the rents are changing.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.280]   And what you described to me, if you've been somewhere for quite a while and if you
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.440]   are a good tenant, most landlords I think would be – are happier to have a good tenant
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.200]   who pays reliably, doesn't cause a lot of problems and they're happy to take a little
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.120]   bit of an undermarket rent.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.680]   So I'm just not that concerned about your rent going from $1,800 a month to $2,000 a
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.240]   month next year.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.500]   That's not going to make a big difference.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.000]   Now you have the exact same risk if you flip it around and say, "Well, if we buy a house,"
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.640]   and here would be the example because now we have the risk of housing prices changing.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:15.480]   If you buy a house that costs $800,000 and there's just a minor 10% correction in the
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:22.120]   cost of housing, that's $80,000 of value that you could lose if you purchased a house
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.880]   and there were a decrease.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   Of course it could go the other way.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.000]   You could have a 10% increase in the value of housing.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.560]   But it's not unusual to have a 10% swing in the price of houses.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.040]   So there's risk either way and if you think about it and you compare the risk of having
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.000]   a house that's $800,000, having a 10% correction in the real estate market, which is going
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.560]   to cost you $80,000 of value, if you take $80,000 out, you would have to have a major
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.600]   – let's do it this way.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:01.000]   At $1,800 a month, if you had an $80,000 decrease in the value of your home, 80,000 divided
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.640]   by 1,800, that would be the equivalent of 44 months or four years of rent, of your total
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   rent.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.520]   So your risk, your personal financial risk as a tenant in this case is much, much lower
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.280]   than your personal financial risk as a homeowner.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   Okay.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   That makes sense.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.920]   I guess I was thinking how housing is so limited.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:39.960]   So housing for sale, buying a home is a good investment because it may just increase significantly
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.600]   and rent is increasing so significantly maybe so that maybe it makes sense to buy.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.920]   But now I have more to think about.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.640]   So go back in the early archives of Radical Personal Finance and I did some shows on real
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.840]   estate, how to do a rent versus buy analysis.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.640]   In your case, I would do one very simple analysis.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.160]   You take a property that you would be interested in buying.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.240]   Find an actual property that's listed.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   Calculate what you would need to do to get a mortgage for it, how much money you would
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   need to put down, calculate what type of mortgage rate you would be eligible for, calculate
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.640]   the cost of taxes and the cost of insurance.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:25.680]   And I'd wager with you that when you do that, I bet you will find the pure cost of that
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   home.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:32.320]   By cost, I mean the cost of your annual real estate taxes, the cost of your annual insurance
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.480]   coverage and any other pure costs – sorry, the cost of interest on your mortgage.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.560]   Those three costs, I would bet that those three costs are in excess of what you're
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.900]   paying in rent by a substantial margin.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.960]   Now you go run the math and if you find that it's very different than that, go ahead.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   You might find otherwise.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:19:00.000]   But to me, I would say that those pure costs are going to be very, very substantial to
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   you.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.080]   So I'm going to run the math on your specific situation, but based upon what you're describing,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.520]   if I woke up in your shoes, I think I would rent.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.120]   Dean in Alabama, welcome to Radical Personal Finance, sir.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.680]   Well, thank you, Joshua.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.240]   It is great to be able to talk to you and I want to say thanks because you do take a
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.320]   different spin on personal finance than most of the other shows do.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.520]   So I guess that's why it's called Radical.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   My pleasure.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   I hope that it's actually a useful spin.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.400]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.560]   Great, great, great.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   Well, my question is about the donor advised funds.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:38.040]   I'm wanting to use one to front load my future charitable contributions.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.800]   And the reason I'm thinking about doing that is I want to put a large sum in there.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.520]   When I say large, it's large for me, you know, $75,000, $80,000.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.040]   And my goal has always been to try to stay in the 15% tax bracket, which gives me plenty,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.000]   plenty, plenty of money to spend, but I will never see any tax deductions because it's
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.720]   hard to make it past the standard deduction.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.880]   So I thought if I front loaded, took the deduction this year, which would be large, then I would
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.960]   have a fund to pull from to make charitable contributions and keep my standard deduction
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.580]   kind of a way of making more cash flow.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.560]   Do you have a high income year this year or do you have another?
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.680]   Is there a is there something that you can foresee that would push you into a high income
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.080]   when that would be particularly helpful to you to make this do this plan?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.200]   Well, if the way my income sits this year and will be probably for the foreseeable near
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.600]   future is going to be about $73,000 for the year.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   And so that's where I was.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.720]   I was thinking that if I front loaded, it was like $75,000 or $80,000.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.160]   Keep me under the when I make the big deduction for the charitable contribution, it still
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.880]   keep me in a 15% tax bracket.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:59.680]   And then like I say, and then between my pension and my wife's social security, I am retired.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.320]   My wife's social security and some disability income she has coming in.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.480]   We really have plenty to cover all the bills.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   I have no debt.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.720]   I'm like I say, I'm retired.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.800]   Most all of my money is in 401ks and IRAs.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.920]   So everything that comes out has got to be taxed anyway.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   And so my goal is to try to pull out and stay in the 15% tax bracket.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.920]   Do you have a local community foundation or a sponsor of the funds that would be appropriate
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.760]   for your personal charitable goals?
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.400]   Well, it would mostly be just church donations.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   And it's mostly that's what I'm thinking of is my tax.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:45.840]   Even paying 10% on $96,000 if you stay in the 15% tax bracket, I still never hit the
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.080]   standard deductions.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.920]   It's almost like you're paying out the money, but you're not getting the deductions.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.120]   So if I front load it, then I can pull it out of the donor advised fund, pay my tithe,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.520]   and I still have the standard deduction to meet up to.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.280]   I haven't been able to find anybody else to tell me whether it makes sense or not.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.640]   It makes sense in my mind.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.680]   Yeah, the biggest thing is just simply finding a local foundation, a local charitable foundation
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.240]   that will run the fund properly.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.320]   And then making sure that the fund will get through to the charitable organization from
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.960]   that donor advised fund.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   So –
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.800]   Would you not be able to use Fidelity or Vanguard as the donor advised funds to do this through?
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.960]   I don't see any reason why you couldn't.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.600]   I don't know what – I don't know of any reason why it wouldn't work.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.560]   I'm not aware of any reason why it wouldn't work.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.880]   Administratively, that would be the next question I would ask because I would call whoever you're
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:52.200]   planning to use as your coordinator for the donor advised fund and make sure that a public
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   – make sure that the charity that you are working with would be an approved charity.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.040]   I don't know – it's a good idea.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.840]   I've never done it and I've never done it with a client and I can't see any conceptual
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.480]   reason why it wouldn't work based upon my knowledge.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.160]   But I would have to actually follow through and work through and see can I actually administratively
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   do it.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   That's the best I can do for you.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.000]   That's – and I haven't been able to find the answer from anyone else either because
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   they say the same thing.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   No one's done it.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   They didn't know anyone that's done it.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.320]   And my – I've always pushed back with, "Well, you can get a tax deduction anyway,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.200]   but you can't get a tax deduction unless you go over $12,700 filing jointly."
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Right, right.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.360]   I would sit down – the church that – so you want all the money to go to your local
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   church, is that right?
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.140]   More than likely, yes.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.140]   Is this local church –
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.920]   Do it in like a monthly or quarterly basis.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.800]   Is this local church a large church or a small church?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.480]   I'm going to say a medium church.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.800]   When I question our financial people on using donor advised funds, they don't have the
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.000]   knowledge.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   They don't understand them.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Right.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.160]   Because they give you that questionable look like, "A what now?"
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.280]   Is there an insurance agent or a financial advisor or an estate attorney that you know
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.140]   of in the church?
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.140]   You know what?
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.140]   Not that I know of.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.140]   Not that I know of.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.800]   I have not heard of anyone that's down them lines.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.360]   So just like you say, even if you used to leave – if I was to move and go to another
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:33.200]   church and I still have my funds that I could pull from to make my contributions then.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   Is it important –
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.720]   I'm just looking at it as a front load, just what I'm looking at it as.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.320]   I'm going to pay a tithe regardless.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.280]   I just want to get the best tax deduction possible.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   I would sit down –
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.920]   And you don't ever know what the tax code's going to change.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.760]   We might not even be able to do that this year.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   You never know.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   I know you got to show them that one too.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.880]   You never know from one year to the next what it's going to be.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.760]   I think for any of us predicting the tax code is the definition of impossibility.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:06.280]   I would have to be really certain of a direct divine revelation to make any comments of
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.560]   a tax code and I probably wouldn't even then declare it out of fear of being completely
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   wrong.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   It's hard.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.280]   It's just like I've worked many years.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.480]   I'm just a factory worker and I've saved in the 401(k), saved in my RAs, deprived
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:30.160]   myself along the way so that I can hit this retirement years and be able to enjoy them.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.880]   So I want to be able to get that money out and pay as few taxes on it as I can and still
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.600]   be able to travel and do things.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   Right.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.680]   And it's really frustrating to have the government leeches come in and pull off 10
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.120]   or 15 percent of the money.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.800]   So here practically is what I think you need to do.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.440]   Number one, I think you need to go and speak to somebody in your local church who has a
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   complete connection.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.040]   If you're in a medium-sized church, there may be somebody there in the church that you
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.440]   don't know that would be a professional expert in this area.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.760]   And so go and ask somebody on your pastoral team, go and ask somebody who's connected
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.240]   in the church and just say, "Do we have any insurance agents?
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.260]   Do we have any financial advisors?
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.620]   Or do we have any tax or estate attorneys or accountants in our church?"
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.000]   It's hard for me to imagine a medium-sized church body that doesn't have at least somebody
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.960]   from one of those areas.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:35.360]   Now with that local professional, it would be good to start and ask, "Hey, here's what
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.480]   I'm thinking," and try to get a referral to a local estate planning attorney or local
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.040]   estate expert.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.840]   Another way to approach it would be to go to your local community foundation.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.760]   Find a community foundation near you and go to your local community foundation.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.480]   Call them up and ask to sit down with one of their planners and describe to them what
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.880]   you're trying to accomplish and describe to them what your financial goals are, what your
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.120]   financial assets are, and what your financial intentions are.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.720]   It's worth it to sit down with a competent estate planner in this context and make sure
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.640]   that this is the best plan.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:22.240]   What I have found doing this type of work in the past is frequently people will neglect
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   an asset or neglect something that is potentially very useful.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.760]   For example, they might have an appreciated stock or an appreciated piece of real estate.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:40.320]   Sometimes you can use that charitably to generate a very high tax deduction while it's not actually
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.480]   costing you all that much out of pocket.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.520]   My biggest fear is that you're thinking on a cash basis when in reality you might have
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   an asset that would be more useful for you and have a higher utility in this context.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.000]   In the church world, you'll be able to find somebody locally.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.100]   You'll be able to find somebody who works in this area.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.500]   You can do this on the phone.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   You can talk with them.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.160]   Tell them about your financial situation.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.440]   You'll be able to find somebody who will work with you.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.080]   There are teams of people who give specific advice in this area.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.200]   The goal is to figure out how to get money into the church and into the local church
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.400]   community in the most efficient way.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.120]   I think you can find somebody in your local area who can look this over with you and make
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.560]   sure that this is the best way for you to approach it.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   Then finally, administratively, I would reach out to the potential sponsor that you have
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.900]   and talk to one of their advisors.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.600]   Every company who would offer this kind of service will have a team of advisors who will
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.880]   talk through this with you.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.640]   If you want to go to Fidelity or you want to go to Vanguard and you want to talk to
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:50.360]   them, they'll put you on the phone with a charitable advisor and they'll put you on
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.800]   the phone with one of their teams and they'll talk this through with you.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   They have the expertise.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.640]   Then finally, if none of those plans work, reach out.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   Do a little bit of research in your local community and find an insurance agent from
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.880]   one of the big old insurance companies.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.680]   Here's the secret to that scenario.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:16.800]   That particular insurance agent may not have specialized knowledge in estate planning.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.160]   But because insurance agents like to sell great big insurance policies, they know that
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.480]   they need experts.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.680]   Most of the insurance companies have is they have teams of what are called advanced planning
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.000]   attorneys.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.520]   These attorneys are real experts in their industry, but they're paid by the insurance
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   company.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:43.120]   You can use this as a way of your getting good, competent, free advice through your
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.880]   relationship with the insurance agent.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.120]   They'll look at the different options.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.360]   They'll talk through the different options with you and they'll make sure that you're
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.880]   getting a good, useful scenario.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.120]   I used to do this all the time.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   I had access to my advanced planning attorneys.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.480]   I have friends that were with other companies.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.120]   They would have access to their advanced planning attorneys.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.680]   It's a good way to get a specialized estate planning attorney on the phone without your
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.320]   having to stroke the check for the hourly fee.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   They'll sit with you.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.600]   They'll talk it through with you and they'll see if they can suggest any ideas that will
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.280]   help you better.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.480]   Those are the action steps that I would take, Dean.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.360]   Deacon Harris That sounds fantastic.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.880]   In my research and doing all this, everything that you touched on right there, I have come
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.080]   across that in all the research.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.240]   My hardest part is like appreciated assets.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.800]   I don't have any appreciated.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.560]   All my money is in this 401(k) and these IRAs.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   It limits you.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.880]   It limits you on how you can use them funds.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.240]   You can have a million dollars in there, but it sure does limit you on how you can get
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.480]   it out and use them funds.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   Just like you were saying before, I didn't put enough money in taxable accounts or buy
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.240]   something or stocks or whatever.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.000]   Something that would appreciate up that you could use in a tax advantage like that.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   All I've got is an income and my 401(k)s and IRAs and that's it.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.360]   Preston Pysh (00:06:00): Have you looked through in your situation
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:16.200]   the IRA, 401(k) charitable contribution directly out of the 401(k)?
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.880]   David Tepker (00:06:10): Out of a 401(k)?
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   No, I have not.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.840]   I did not know that you could do that straight out of a 401(k), not unless you were 70 and
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   a half.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   So…
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   Tavish Leff (00:06:22): You can make…
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:34.040]   I'm not current enough to walk you through this in a live format.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.480]   I've gotten rusty on this topic in the last couple of years and I'm just not current
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.160]   enough to walk you through the details in a live format.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   Do a web search.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   Just pull up duck.go and do a web search for 401(k) charitable contributions and read through
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.080]   that.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:58.320]   This was a big opportunity about three, four, five years ago, something like that.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.240]   This was a big opportunity when the tax law changed about four or five opportunities to
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.480]   do direct contributions of retirement assets directly to the charity.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:15.920]   And so you would need to just pull it up, look at it, read it, find the IRS website
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:22.360]   appropriate publication on this and look to see what the current rules are on making charitable
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.240]   contributions directly from your retirement funds.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:35.520]   The benefit is it may be a way for you to get money out of the 401(k) and get it directly
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.000]   to the charity while doing it in a very efficient way with minimum fees.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.680]   So again, just do some searching and do some additional research on charitable contributions
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.440]   directly out of a retirement account and hopefully that will help you.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.960]   Eddie in Virginia, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.440]   Eddie: Hey, Joshua.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   I'm calling.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.840]   I just want to get some career advice on you.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.160]   I'm contemplating a move out of my current industry.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.960]   Currently I'm a commission-based employee, 100%, and in an industry that goes up and
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.920]   down pretty often.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.200]   And I'm thinking of making a move, but I'd take a pretty significant pay cut.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   It wouldn't change my lifestyle drastically because my wife and I don't spend a lot of
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.400]   money, but it would definitely change some of our plans.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.880]   And I just wanted to see what sort of advice you had.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.760]   Well, if you're going to make less money, why would you make the move?
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   What's in it for you?
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   Joshua: Stability.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   It's a salary.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.120]   Yes, stability, salary position, typically.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:46.680]   Eddie: Has living on an unknown up and down income, has that been hard for you?
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.400]   Joshua: Yes.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.360]   Yeah, because you've talked about this before.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.920]   Some months you make $20,000 and some months you make zero.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:02.040]   Not that budgeting's hard, but it's just very difficult to game plan where it is.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.480]   And my organization has been not as great on delivering products in a timely manner
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   outside of my control.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   So it's hard.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.560]   Eddie: So in the last year, how much have you made in the last year in your commission-based
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   job?
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.280]   Joshua: I will approximately make about $100,000.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.400]   Eddie: And if you go to the salary-based job, how much do you think you'll make in the next
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   year?
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.520]   Joshua: About $80,000 to $85,000.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:33.040]   Eddie: In your commission-based job, have you exhausted all of your opportunities to
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.760]   dramatically increase your income under your current commission structure?
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.080]   Joshua: Yes.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:44.520]   Eddie: In your salary-based job, will there be opportunities for substantial increases
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.080]   in your income?
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.160]   Joshua: I believe so if I move up into a higher level management position, yes.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:58.480]   Well, that to me is the biggest concern because, yes, commissions can be stressful.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.200]   And I think here you have to ask the question, "What's the cost for you?
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.440]   What's the cost for your wife?
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.840]   What's the cost on your family?"
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.760]   There are different levels of stress that you may or may not find helpful and find difficult.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:19.840]   An example, in my situation, I've lived on a highly fluctuating, highly variable income
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.600]   since 2008 and it's been hard, very hard at times.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.040]   But I've learned this increasing skills to deal with it.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.480]   I still have a long way to learn, I'm sure.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.780]   But I've learned increasing skills to deal with it and I've been able to make steps in
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:39.040]   order to put enough of a financial buffer that is not so painful as it once was.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.600]   There were times where early – earlier in life, it was quite painful.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.080]   But I've learned and it's not particularly painful to me at this point in time.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:54.660]   And in integrating with my wife, there were times during our joint management of finances
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.840]   early in our marriage where it was painful.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.220]   But my wife never – it was never an emotional problem for her.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.360]   She was never emotionally connected to the challenge of having low-income months and
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   high-income months.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.600]   So it was never all that stressful for her.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.320]   Thus, it was never all that stressful in our marriage.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.040]   I've worked and counseled other couples who were in similar industries and experienced
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.680]   similar fluctuations of income.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   And in their situation, for differing reasons, their experience of the stress of fluctuating
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.200]   income was very, very different.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:36.400]   And specifically, I know of one couple that I was engaged in in personal financial counseling
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:43.320]   where for them to go from a fluctuating income to a fixed income, even though there was a
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.600]   slight pay cut, was a tremendous blessing for them and their family and their overall
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   emotional makeup, especially for the emotional stability of the wife.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.240]   And so I think that you should analyze that separate from financial increase.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.000]   And that's not a factor to be discounted.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.640]   It's something that's important.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.560]   Now, on the flip side, you should look and say, "Well, if I do make this switch, how
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.800]   much is it going to cost me and then how much am I giving up on the upside?"
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:19.720]   If you've maximized all your opportunities and you're maxed out at about $100,000, then
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.640]   that doesn't sound too exciting to me, no matter whether you're a commissioner or salary.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.360]   If this other job is a better fit for you and you can move to a salary position at $80,000
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.040]   but maybe a year and a half from now, you can make a jump in the levels of the company
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.280]   and go from 80 to 120, that sounds probably more exciting than the fact that you're maxed
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.580]   out on commission at $100,000 with your current business structure.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:45.200]   So the fact that there's not a big possible increase on the commission basis to me just
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.680]   doesn't sound that exciting.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.520]   And for those reasons, I think I probably would.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.920]   I'd probably take the temporary pay cut, move to the stable income.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.360]   That will be helpful.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.960]   And then focus on what do I need to do to bump up in the level of the compensation tier
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:05.160]   here or to move into the bonus program here even though it's not directly tied to commissions.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Okay.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   Awesome.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   Thank you.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   You're welcome.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Did we miss anything?
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   Are there any other extenuating factors?
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   Is that good enough?
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   No.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.760]   I mean, that's really what it came down to.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.160]   My current position is odd hours as well, so that's putting some stress there.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.800]   I'm going to add that.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.720]   The other position is going to be more of a nine to five.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.000]   So those were factors that I'd already kind of ruled what I'm willing to do, but I wanted
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.280]   to get your opinion on it.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.620]   So I really appreciate your podcast.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.040]   It's hard to say.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.640]   The odd hours are actually a big benefit and so is just simple stability.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:47.780]   I think most of us who work in these commission-based or fluctuating income scenarios, I think most
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.920]   of us regularly look at and say, "You know what?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   Maybe I should go get a job."
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   It's funny.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.080]   I was talking about this with a friend of mine who is also an entrepreneur and we were
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.760]   talking about the challenges of just simply trying to build a business starting with nothing
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.080]   with young children.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:10.560]   And our comment together, both him and me, and we're motivated, goal-oriented people,
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:17.400]   was we underestimated how difficult it was to build a business that would work when also
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.480]   trying to do a good job with young children.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:27.560]   And many times I think you look around and as much as I love entrepreneurship and business,
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.720]   et cetera, I think there is a lot of benefit in simply having a job that is steady, that
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   provides a steady income, it helps with planning and provides a good structure.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.360]   And I think that can work really good benefits.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.040]   Travis in Kentucky, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.040]   How can I help you, sir?
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.040]   Travis Buehler, CEO, Radical Personal Finance, Inc.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.040]   I appreciate you taking the call and appreciate all that you do on the podcast.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.200]   I really enjoy it.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.600]   My wife and I were recently blessed to welcome our new daughter into the family.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.880]   So we now have a 4-year-old and a 2-week-old and we're looking to add some coverage to
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.400]   our life insurance.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:13.120]   I currently have a million dollars worth of term life insurance coverage and my wife doesn't
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.600]   have anything currently.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.960]   And I was exploring the options between just adding term life, some more coverage for both
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.720]   myself and for her, but also weighing that against the idea of maybe doing something
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.040]   like a joint universal life coverage.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.560]   And I guess I've heard you talk about it extensively in recent podcasts and heard you talk about
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.400]   how it can be such a valuable tool, you know, in different circumstances and that you have
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.200]   policies in your family.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.760]   And I guess as I run through some of the scenarios doing my math, it's hard for me to overcome
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.120]   the idea of buy term and invest the rest.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   Most of the calculations I do, that seems to be the most beneficial way to go.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.560]   But I guess before I went ahead and made a decision, I was wanting to pick your brain
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.520]   about some other things I may not be considering.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.800]   What's your household income?
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.600]   $150,000.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.160]   Okay.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.280]   So there's two levels of analysis.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.200]   Just what makes me nervous is you talked about a joint policy.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.240]   Why were you considering purchasing a joint life policy?
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:30.680]   Well, I guess the idea was, is the reason that we were wanting to buy the insurance
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.720]   was not so much for the end, you know, hopefully we live to be the ripe old age and, you know,
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.120]   dying at 85, 90, 95, whatever, and then having a death benefit come to us.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.160]   That's not really the idea of why I want to buy the coverage.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.960]   It's more of if one of us dies prematurely, you know, I want to be able to have some money
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.480]   to cover, you know, the, basically the services that she provides to the family.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   Of course.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.800]   And of course, vice versa for me.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.240]   So I guess the idea of maybe doing a joint policy was you kill two birds with one stone
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.120]   and you know, I'm covered if I die quicker or she's covered or, you know, vice versa.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.400]   I'm covered if she dies quicker, she's covered if I die quicker.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.880]   You know, it might not be that there's any benefit.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.920]   You know, maybe a whole life on me and a whole life on her, you know, maybe that's something
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   to explore as well.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.080]   Um, and I guess that's, but still I always run into the idea that, you know, the term
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   is cheaper.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.800]   And if I take the difference between what I would be putting in a whole life policy
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:36.080]   and just I'm responsible and invest that, you know, reasonably well, um, the time horizon
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.600]   that you're talking about with, you know, holding a whole life policy, if you let your
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.320]   capital accumulate, you know, in a mutual fund or, you know, you know, well diversified
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.400]   investment account, uh, at the end of the day, I keep coming back to the idea, well,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.240]   I'm better off just doing that.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.160]   Um, and so I guess I'm wondering, is there an aspect that maybe I should be considering,
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.360]   um, before I just go ahead and say, yes, that's what I should do.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.680]   Um, and the reason why I guess I'm a little bit nervous is I, I listened to you talk and
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:15.480]   I foresee and maybe project some of the things that you're probably doing with your personal
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.240]   finances and I'm wondering why you're arriving at the idea that, yeah, a whole life policy
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   is better for me.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.880]   Um, cause I'd imagine we're probably similar with the way that we approach, um, you know,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.320]   these, these types of problems.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:36.200]   So I want to, yeah, the error that you're making is the either or, uh, discussion.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.720]   And that's usually the error when it comes to the buy term invest the difference discussion
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:45.400]   is we're not as, as York, you're saying I should either do this or I should do that.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   So hold on one second.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.520]   We'll get the whole life insurance in just a moment.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.120]   First the joint life discussion.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.640]   Um, I assume that you were talking about a joint life first to die policy.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.840]   Uh, is that right?
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.960]   Or were you, were you talking about a second to die policy?
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.960]   Okay.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   All right.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.560]   I don't like this and I don't think there's any benefit to your buying a joint life first
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   to die policy.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:09.320]   Uh, for the sake of other listeners, you can purchase a life insurance policy that is,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.280]   is, it is, uh, underwritten on the life of two people.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.920]   Uh, and there are two ways that it can be done.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.120]   The first way it can be done.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.680]   So in this, in this particular situation, it would be underwritten on the life of Travis
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.320]   and on Travis's wife, Travis, how old are you?
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.280]   How old's your wife?
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.600]   I'm 33 and she is 32.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   Okay.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:37.400]   So the idea here is, um, whenever one of them dies, then the policy would pay out a certain
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.120]   sum of money.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.280]   And uh, uh, then, and hopefully the idea is because it's on two, two lives, it's a little
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   bit cheaper than it would be on one or the other.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.160]   Uh, I don't like it.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.600]   I don't think that, um, and this, these are guesses.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:57.680]   You could disprove this with your actual numbers from some insurance companies.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.760]   I'm giving you a gut feeling based upon experience, not a, uh, a mathematically calculated provable
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.080]   thing where I just ran, um, policies on you.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.920]   Joint life first to die policies are very rare.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.880]   And so I don't think the market is competitive.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.640]   I think if you buy a joint life first to die policy, you're going to wind up paying more
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:24.120]   per, um, uh, per thousand dollars of insurance than you will with a term life policy.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.440]   Term life policies are so competitive.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.720]   The prices are in the floor.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.960]   And so I don't think you're going to get as much of a benefit.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.680]   Number two, I don't think you're going to get, um, the coverage that you should get.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:44.060]   If, if my wife dies, then, uh, my, then I need money in order for me to be able to care
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.400]   for our children in the way that we want our children to be cared for.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.680]   I couldn't do that if she were dead, if she didn't have life insurance.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.760]   But now I still face the risk of, well, what about me if I die?
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.880]   And the money that I would need to care for my children is not the same amount of money
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.840]   as my children would need if both of us were dead.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:12.400]   And so I think a much happier with the plan to a much happier with the plan to put in
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:19.080]   place, uh, uh, policies on both of us so that if she dies, then I receive money.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.480]   If I die, she receives money.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.760]   And if we both die, then our children receive the sum total of all of the money.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.320]   So I don't like the structure of the joint life.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.680]   Also there are concerns with regard to ownership, who's going to own the policy, how is the
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.360]   policy going to be owned?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   And there are concerns for you, for your wife and for your children to protect you in case
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.640]   of divorce.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.600]   What happens if you were to divorce?
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.440]   Um, what happens to the policy and how do we make sure that the insurance stays in force?
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.400]   So as a financial planner, I just, I don't like the joint life first to die.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   That's different.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.520]   That's very different than joint life second to die when we're using that at a later stage.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.200]   But for you as a young family, I don't see any compelling benefit to pursuing a joint
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.840]   life first to die policy.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   Make sense?
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.840]   Okay.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   Okay.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.240]   Now, second, we're talking about term life insurance versus universal life insurance.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.160]   This is a blanket statement, but this is kind of my opinion based upon experience.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.840]   I don't like universal life insurance for unsophisticated people.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   Universal life insurance has its place and it's a useful tool, but I don't like universal
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.800]   life insurance for unsophisticated people.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.760]   And unsophisticated is not an insult, but it's a level of understanding of how insurance
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   works.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.560]   Universal life insurance is the most complicated form of insurance and it can be a useful tool
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.400]   because of the flexibility.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.660]   It can be a useful tool in the hands of a competent financial planner or in the case
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.960]   of a sophisticated insurance buyer.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.720]   But many people buy it and they don't understand how it works.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.160]   So universal life insurance is often underfunded and it often doesn't work long term.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:07.520]   Now it can be a way of providing a family with the equivalent in some cases of an extended
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.120]   term life insurance policy with options.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.840]   But it's so complicated that it's very hard for me in my experience to believe that the
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.360]   average person with a basic working knowledge of insurance would be able to successfully
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.440]   buy one and get all the benefits of it.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.880]   I much prefer the simplicity of term life insurance.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.360]   The second problem with universal life insurance is what is it invested in?
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.000]   And if the policy is a variable universal life contract, which it frequently is, then
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.400]   all of a sudden now we have to factor on the risk factors of stock and equities markets
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.600]   and the risk factors of an insurance product and it just becomes very complicated.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.920]   It does have a place but I don't like it for young couples who just need simple insurance
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.920]   planning.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:58.960]   So I'm very nervous about you pursuing a universal life insurance contract as the basis for – in
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   any regard.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.240]   I like the simplicity of term life insurance.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   With me so far?
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   Okay.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.240]   Okay.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.280]   Now you need a lot of term life insurance and your wife needs a lot of term life insurance.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.880]   Chances are I don't know anything about your assets but at your age, I don't see
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.400]   any reason for you not to have double or double and a half the amount of term life insurance
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   coverage that you have.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.040]   I don't see any reason for you not to – for your wife not to have a million dollars
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   of insurance coverage for her.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:32.080]   Term life insurance is so cheap that there's a compelling benefit for you to have quite
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   a bit of it.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.240]   With $150,000 annual household income, it will make – the cost of premiums will make
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.600]   effectively no difference in your household versus the potential benefit of your having
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.780]   two or three million dollars of coverage and your wife having a million dollars of coverage.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.400]   You can go and you can do more careful calculations, et cetera.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.720]   But we're talking about the cost of a pizza.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.280]   For 32, 33-year-old healthy non-tobacco users, we're talking about the cost of a pizza
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:04.020]   a month, a couple of pizzas a month and you'll like having more and it will put more tools
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.400]   in your portfolio.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:12.980]   The best thing for me about life insurance is that having millions of dollars of term
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:19.080]   life insurance allows me to guarantee my financial legacy for my children.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:24.680]   It's one of the most powerful feelings you can get when you're young and you don't
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.280]   yet have all the money that you want to have.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:34.120]   It is really rewarding to recognize the fact that if I'm dead, I can guarantee a significant
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:40.800]   estate for my children and term life insurance is one of the most powerful financial tools
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   to do that.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:47.600]   For you as a 33-year-old male healthy non-tobacco user, you can have two to two and a half,
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.880]   three million dollars of life insurance for something like probably 75, 80 bucks a month
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.880]   depending on the structure.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:51:00.120]   Once you have that, you'll find that that is very, very powerful in terms of psychologically
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.320]   or at least I have found it to be that way.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.320]   So don't look at anything, don't look at universal life insurance, don't look at
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:13.480]   whole life insurance, don't look at anything until you have properly established the total
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:19.720]   amount of death benefit that you need with regard to you and your wife using term life
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   insurance.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.720]   Make sense?
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:29.880]   Now, with whole life insurance, I would like you to have insurance policies on your children's
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.560]   lives, small whole life insurance policies on your children's lives before you buy
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.320]   it for you.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.360]   So if you are willing to spend a little bit more money on insurance and you properly squared
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:44.840]   away term life insurance for you and your wife and you can buy some small whole life
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.640]   policies for your children, I think that's a good idea.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.200]   I own whole life insurance policies on all of my children, small ones, well-designed
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.720]   from a good company that will be an efficient accumulation of money over time.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.680]   I've done shows on life insurance for children in the past.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.560]   Also make sure that your disability insurance is squared away fully, that you have as much
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.700]   as you can get and that you're covered and make sure that your health insurance is squared
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.940]   away as well.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:16.280]   Now once health insurance, disability insurance, term life insurance are squared away, now
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.780]   we can have the whole life insurance conversation.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.360]   But it's not either or because there's no comparison between the two.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.400]   It's not either you buy a million dollars of term life insurance or you buy $33,000
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.740]   of whole life insurance.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.720]   We always solve death benefit needs first and we always solve that with term life insurance.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.320]   You don't solve death benefit needs with whole life insurance.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   Okay.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   Okay.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.600]   Now, should you buy some whole life insurance?
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.900]   If the question is buy term and invest the difference, so you have to recognize you can't
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.360]   buy term and invest the difference and get the equivalent of a whole life insurance policy.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.800]   Whole life insurance is a unique product.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.320]   If you're going to compare, should I buy a whole life insurance because I'm already telling
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.960]   you, you should buy term.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.080]   You should buy term.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.720]   So now separate the question from either or and say, "I'm considering buying a whole life
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:14.160]   insurance contract or I'm considering purchasing this other investment."
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.000]   Now compare them on the merits.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.920]   And where the whole conversation breaks down is that if you're an aggressive investor and
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.480]   if equities markets continue to perform, in general, an equity market should outperform
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.120]   a traditional portfolio-based whole life insurance contract and it should.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.560]   Now, it doesn't always and the returns come at varied times.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.100]   It should outperform that.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:40.240]   The basic functional benefit of whole life insurance that I appreciate is a few things.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.080]   Number one, whole life insurance is a stable asset.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.800]   Life insurance companies, well-run life insurance companies and a traditional non-equity, business-based
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.560]   based life insurance contract is – the value of the contract is guaranteed to go up.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.880]   The amount at which it goes up changes but it's guaranteed to go up.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.120]   That gives me a stable pile of money.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:09.840]   Second thing I like about it is if a policy is well-constructed and it's well-purchased,
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.760]   it can be fairly efficient.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   It can function and be fairly efficient.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.160]   It's going to have higher costs than some other things because you have to deal with
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.480]   the cost of insurance.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.080]   But it can be fairly efficient.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.600]   It's also very flexible.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:31.360]   And so unlike some other things that I can choose to invest and put money into, a whole
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.640]   life insurance contract can be flexible.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.120]   I can put money in or take money out anytime I want.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:41.400]   So I have a stable pile of money that can increase, that was guaranteed to increase
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:47.180]   at a varying rate, that will be very, very safe and it will function as a non-correlating
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.080]   asset to some of my other investments and it's very, very flexible.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:55.960]   I can get money in and out of it and it's protected and exempt from the claims of creditors.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.280]   That's helpful.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.320]   Just like the money in a 401(k) and IRA is.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.920]   It's not the only asset.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.640]   But it is protected and exempt from the claims of creditors and it pays out a death benefit
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   which can be very, very useful and that death benefit is paid out income tax-free and it's
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.080]   an asset that I can pledge a security for a loan.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.880]   It's an asset that I can move into a trust.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.980]   It's a very, very flexible asset.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:22.480]   Where people make the mistake is trying to make it do everything and I think that's
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.640]   a wrong approach.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.680]   So I think it's worth – I don't have an insurance license.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.580]   I don't sell whole life insurance anymore.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:35.280]   But my generalized advice has often been to purchase – you always cover death benefit
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.920]   with term life insurance.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:43.180]   And if you find benefits in the whole life insurance attributes and if you can develop
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:48.400]   a policy that's well-run, well-built, et cetera, then there is a place for you to put
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.640]   some money into it if it's useful to you.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.980]   But that's as far as I would go.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:59.460]   To me, that's a practical, actual, realistic way to approach it.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.360]   Most of the argument on the subject where it's all – it's a matter of everything
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.520]   into whole life insurance or nothing into whole life insurance.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.520]   It's up to the devil.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.180]   It's just a waste of money.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.160]   Those have not been true in my experience.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:14.300]   So what I've just described to you is about the only way that I can get at what seems
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.940]   to be true based upon my experience and my knowledge.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.740]   Ryan Neuhofeldt Okay.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:26.140]   So if I'm hearing you correctly, in essence you're saying if the idea is to cover expenses
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:31.460]   or debt due to the event of your death and you're looking for the death benefit, then
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.220]   you focus on your term life insurance.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:40.160]   If you're looking for other ways to invest capital, look at a whole life insurance policy
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.440]   more like a bond proxy, an alternative to a bond or an alternative to another investment.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   Is that in essence –
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   Trevor Burrus Yeah, that is –
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:52.760]   Ryan Neuhofeldt – that might have the additional benefit of a death benefit should you die?
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.080]   Trevor Burrus Exactly.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.640]   And I don't underestimate the value of that death benefit.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.480]   One of the things that – when I first got into the insurance business, I thought that
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:07.000]   as you got older, your need and your value of insurance, of life insurance would go down.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.720]   The basic concept is that over time, you should be able to self-insure.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.260]   So you buy term life insurance when you're younger.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:20.320]   Over time, you're able to self-insure because you have more assets and you have fewer liabilities.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.760]   You pay down your debts.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.960]   Your children grow and move out of the house and so you have fewer liabilities to – fewer
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.520]   responsibilities and fewer liabilities.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.600]   So you get to the point where you need less insurance and hopefully at some point you
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.880]   need no insurance.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.440]   Now, that's not wrong.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   It does happen.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.320]   It's obvious that it happens that your responsibilities change over time as your children grow and
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.860]   move out of the house.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:51.400]   But my experience in working with actual clients was that very few people actually got to the
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:57.560]   self-insurance model because what tends to happen in the arc of finance and the cycle
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:04.920]   of many families was that people didn't necessarily downsize from so much as they
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   other days did.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.760]   They might have moved to a smaller house but they often upgraded it to a luxury house or
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.680]   they often just found that they liked having the insurance.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:18.240]   When I think about children and my wife, I feel a significant amount of responsibility
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.280]   to my wife to make sure that if I die, even if our children are grown and gone, that she
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   is well-supported.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.860]   Now, I want to do that with assets.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.440]   But as an example, my wife is not an income earner in our household.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.240]   She is at home full time and she's not an income earner.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:39.520]   So as a husband, I owe her a duty of care that goes beyond the life of my children.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.800]   I need to make sure that because she is not earning income, she doesn't have income where
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   she's saving.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.520]   I owe her a duty of care to make sure that if I die after our children are grown, that
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:56.440]   she is able to continue in our lifestyle without the need to go and to get a job, without the
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.920]   need to go and move into poverty.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:06.480]   So what happens is there becomes value – there comes a lot of value with the life insurance
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   policy.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.400]   Then finally as an estate, with the whole life insurance policy, the policy always being
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.580]   in force.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.600]   When you get them when you're young, the premiums disappear over time or they're
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.000]   so insignificant as to be – well, insignificant.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.300]   So they become a very useful asset.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.660]   Even as a financial planner, I look at it and I like the idea to be able to use life
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.260]   insurance as a way to equalize the estate.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:34.820]   I'm too young and you're too young to have any clue about paying estate taxes.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.100]   But that's often been a scenario where you have to cover and say, "Well, how do we
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.640]   pay these estate taxes?"
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.300]   Life insurance is a particularly useful and flexible tool.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.660]   It's not the only tool but it's a particularly useful and flexible tool.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:50.060]   So in the hands of a competent financial planner, a life insurance policy is a very flexible
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.060]   asset.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.100]   It doesn't work for everything.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.660]   It's just a flexible asset that has value.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.300]   That's about as far as I would go.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.300]   Make sense?
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   Steve Horwitz: Okay.
[00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.540]   Yes, it does.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:03.620]   One follow-up question I would have with in terms to the children, how do you determine
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:07.420]   the amount of a whole life insurance policy to place on a child?
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.160]   Trevor Burrus: Life insurance company will have a minimum amount that they'll cover.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.780]   You may be able to cover a death benefit.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.660]   I mean not be remiss and say that you have to buy whole life insurance.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:23.140]   You sometimes can cover a death benefit as a term life insurance rider but this is usually
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.260]   only found in the context of employer-based life insurance.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.960]   I haven't seen that frequently on individual-based life insurance.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.700]   But if you have a job, you may be able to put life insurance contract on your children
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.620]   through your group life insurance contract.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.760]   The only contracts that you can buy in the open market that I'm aware of for children
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.780]   are going to be whole life insurance contracts.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.740]   The insurance company will have a minimum policy size that they'll sell.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.620]   It's often $25,000.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620]   Sometimes it's $15,000.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.580]   Sometimes it varies but often it's something like $25,000.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:04.100]   What I often encourage clients to do is to put the minimum policy, a $25,000 policy on
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:10.380]   each of their children and to put it on there with what's called an additional purchase
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.380]   benefit.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.180]   One of the benefits of a life insurance policy for children is yes to have some insurance
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.180]   coverage in case they die.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.540]   But that's not my big thing.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.380]   I've always appreciated having what's called an additional purchase benefit which guarantees
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.700]   their ability to buy additional insurance in the future.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:32.780]   Now that's a cost and it means that from the perspective of an investment calculation,
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:39.200]   just pure cash accumulation, that a child's policy doesn't – it's not as efficient
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.400]   as others because there's a higher cost of insurance.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.300]   When you add an additional purchase benefit or a waiver of premium benefit onto it, it
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.520]   changes the efficiency of the contract.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.660]   Those are pure insurance benefits.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.460]   Thus, they add additional cost.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:58.700]   And so my children's policies are not spectacular when measured by a rate of return perspective.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.980]   But they're very, very useful when measured by an insurance perspective and that's how
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.380]   I view them just simply as an insurance perspective.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.100]   I have them for all of my children.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.140]   I sold a lot of them when I was an insurance agent.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   It just made sense from – I've always just felt like it makes sense.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.420]   If you've got the financial – now, it's not appropriate for somebody who has no money.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.440]   If somebody is scraping to get by and it's not appropriate, people don't have their
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.940]   own coverage squared away.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:28.500]   That's why I talked about disability insurance for you, life insurance for you and your wife,
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.900]   make sure your health insurance is on track, et cetera.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.400]   But if you can cover those things out of your income and there's still additional flexible
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.540]   money that can cover it, I find it compelling.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.580]   Trevor Burrus: OK.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:47.060]   The idea is they can always purchase more life insurance even if they're sick or have
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.060]   some disability.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.140]   Is that what that rider is?
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.140]   Tavish Lynch: Exactly.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.140]   It's an additional purchase benefit.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:57.820]   So for example, with the policies that I own for my children, at each – I think if memory
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:03.940]   is right, there are seven opportunities starting at the age of 20, between the ages of 20 and
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.780]   40, every three years, wherein the insurance company will send them a letter and during
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:15.280]   a 90-day period, the child can exercise the additional purchase benefit option and they
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.580]   can just simply say, "Yes, I would like to purchase an additional $150,000 of insurance."
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.420]   The only downside is they're not – that doesn't apply to term life insurance.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.300]   It's only whole life insurance that they can purchase.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.980]   But at each of those times, they have the option guaranteed to be able to purchase an
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.600]   additional $150,000 of life insurance.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:42.420]   So what it means is that you can have a child who has a $25,000 policy and with that $25,000
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:48.120]   policy, if they can buy an additional purchase option of 150,000 times seven, you wind up
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.680]   where they can purchase up to basically over a million dollars of life insurance without
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.100]   any medical exams, without any lifestyle questions.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.260]   It means no hobby questions, no avocations, no occupation questions.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.900]   So those things that are often very, very difficult for a client – sometimes it's
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   health stuff.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.180]   But that's – maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:14.140]   But a lot of times, maybe the child is a beginning pilot or they're learning to fly helicopters
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:18.340]   or they're engaged in a risky occupation or they're doing something like they're
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.540]   a race car driver.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.060]   You can't get insurance in those contexts.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.860]   But with the additional purchase benefit, there's the option there for them to be
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.420]   able to get new contracts.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   Now I'm probably – let me not hedge that.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:35.300]   I'm biased because of my experience as an insurance agent.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.020]   What happens is when I – I still don't like certain kinds of insurance.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:43.100]   I'm still very kind of cheap when it comes to buying insurance.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.600]   I still – I share that ethic of I don't like to buy insurance, that ethic that many
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.780]   of us have.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.140]   But when you go into the insurance business, you start to see different situations and
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.260]   over the years, my appreciation of insurance has substantially increased and you're
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.500]   hearing that tone come through in my voice based upon experience, seeing how in so many
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:10.380]   situations having that insurance in force would be really, really valuable.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:16.580]   It's hard to talk about because the chances are so remote.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.420]   I've never told the story on radical personal finance.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:28.260]   But just as a way of example of showing how valuable an insurance contract can be, I was
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.500]   – I had a client of mine in the past.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.640]   This client was probably not a great fit.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:40.860]   They weren't a great fit for insurance because they had a highly fluctuating income and they
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.700]   were entrepreneurs and they were in an industry which when I first met them was in a really
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:51.820]   tough space and in the construction industry.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:58.300]   When I first met them, I was a very novice insurance agent and they were excited about
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.380]   buying insurance and as a novice insurance agent, I was impressed with the fact that
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:07.260]   they were excited and because they were excited about buying insurance, I was excited about
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.540]   selling them insurance.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.860]   So I sold them life insurance policies on the whole family.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.900]   Now, I did a good job, term life insurance mom and dad.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:20.140]   But I sold them – in addition to that, I sold them child policies on their children
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.580]   and I felt really good about it.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:28.460]   But I underestimated because of my greenness, because of my novice experience in the business,
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:34.180]   I underestimated their financial capacity to pay and I had gotten over exuberant in
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.940]   what I had sold them and I underestimated their financial capacity to pay.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.660]   A year later, I forget if it was less than a year.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.100]   I forget if the policies technically lapsed or not.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:47.300]   But basically a year or something later, they couldn't keep up the payments and so the
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.780]   insurance went out of force.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.820]   It lapsed and I felt very bad about that.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.740]   As an insurance agent, one of the worst things that can happen for a client is if they buy
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.540]   anything other than term life insurance, if they buy whole life insurance of any kind
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.500]   and then the policy lapses, it winds up being very, very expensive in the short term because
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.240]   there are so many costs at the inception of a contract that if they don't keep the contract,
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.500]   it winds up going out of force and it's very, very expensive.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:17.060]   So the policy lapsed and I was of course disappointed but what could I do?
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.500]   Well, a few years later, they reached out to me again.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.840]   Things were better at this point and things were better and they were doing better.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.980]   Their business was more stable and so they said, "We want to buy insurance again.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.580]   We really liked having it but we want to buy it again."
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.340]   Well, they were excited about buying it.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.820]   I was excited about selling it.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:40.260]   So I went and I sold them a whole new suite of life insurance policies, proper good planning
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.060]   term for mom and dad and whole life for the kids.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.260]   I was excited about it and it was great.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:51.740]   Well, unfortunately yet again, they – and I had – by this point, I had a little bit
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.740]   more experience.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.660]   I was a little more cautious but they were demonstrating significant capacity to pay.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.700]   Their business was stable.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:02.900]   They were in a good place.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.900]   So I sold them policies.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.940]   Well, I can't remember exactly what happened at this point but sometime later, they wound
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.380]   up lapsing those policies again.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.740]   I think they made it through so it wasn't as expensive.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.620]   They lapsed all the policies and I was disappointed but I didn't worry too much about it.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.540]   They had moved out of the area and I just said, "Well, sometimes as an insurance agent
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.500]   is too, sometimes clients don't talk to you.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.700]   They lapse their stuff and they go on.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   That's life.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.700]   That's business."
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:30.140]   Well, unfortunately, I forget the exact timing but a couple of years later, their youngest
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:37.500]   son was murdered and it was just a heartbreaking story but their youngest son was murdered.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.300]   I was pretty distraught about it.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.980]   I don't want to – the word devastated comes to mind.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:48.220]   It's probably a little bit of an overly charged word but I was really disappointed and really
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.180]   upset.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.700]   I went through and I just thought, "Was there anything I could have done to keep that in
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.700]   force?
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.340]   Why do you think did I not do my job of keeping the insurance in force for them?"
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:06.900]   But it's pretty devastating because I watched then the horror of watching parents deal with
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.620]   the murder of their young son.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.300]   He was six, seven years old.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:17.620]   I wished so much that that insurance contract had been in force because if it had been in
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.260]   force, it would have been so helpful to mom and dad.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.560]   Now thank God their marriage survived.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.820]   Very frequently in the death of a child, when a couple experiences the death of a child,
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.460]   very frequently their marriage does not survive.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.740]   Thank God their marriage survived.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.780]   They worked through it and thank God they've had another child.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.620]   So in the end, tragedy turns to triumph.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:46.180]   But in that circumstance, I saw so clearly what a benefit that life insurance policy
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.180]   would be.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.980]   Now that's an experience I've just shared with you, the emotion of it.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:54.700]   I put that experience up against hundreds of other child life insurance policies that
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:10:00.020]   I sold that the child is fine and chances are it will just be kind of a decent long-term
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.020]   policy and that's the nature of insurance.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:06.380]   So once you're exposed to that business as an insurance agent, then it starts to affect
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:13.060]   your emotions and you start to see how valuable that is and it changed me.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.060]   That experience changed me.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.820]   Travis, I'll give you the last word before I go on to my final caller.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   Travis Thurston: Sure.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820]   No, I appreciate it.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   That's all great advice.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.540]   You answered what I needed to know.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.540]   I really appreciate it.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.580]   Marc Thiessen: Well, congratulations to you and your wife on the birth of your child.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.820]   I think that's fantastic and I think you'll make good decisions.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.580]   Hopefully this was helpful for you.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.500]   All right, last caller of the day, Gidish from Tennessee.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   Welcome to the show.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   How can I serve you today, please?
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   Gidish Gidish: Thank you, Joshua.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:46.860]   You have been doing tremendous job and I appreciate you doing this for non-patrons of the show.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:54.260]   I have two questions and I'm aware of your views on 529 plan, but I'll do a little bit
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.260]   of my background.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:03.340]   I currently have, I contribute to maximum possible for both me and my wife, 401 account.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:08.100]   This should be a year we should be able to maximize on Roth as well.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.860]   Have a good term and disability insurance in place.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.540]   We have two daughters.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.380]   One is almost three year old.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.160]   One is about nine month old.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.960]   And so my goal for next year is start considering about 529.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.460]   My education was not in this country.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:29.760]   And so it was very customary for parents to fund college education and I would probably
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.340]   want to continue to an extent.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:38.020]   I understand this is a different culture and I want them to take ownership of their education.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:42.580]   So I haven't really figured out all the thoughts I would like to do, but I do know that if
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:48.060]   I want to fund some portion of it, this is the time to start thinking about it as far
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:52.840]   as 529 and time horizon of 15, 20 years or whatnot.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.580]   So what would be a good goal to, you know, in terms of amount of money, let's say, you
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.980]   know, if I'm thinking at least half of their education, I want to help and then the rest
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.980]   of them, I can either, depending on how they do, they can take a loan out or I can help
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.980]   with my taxable.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:15.300]   So I know a lot of prediction involved, but what would be a good amount you would consider?
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.300]   And I have one more question after that.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.900]   You said you listened to my shows on 529s?
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.900]   Yes.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:28.060]   I mean, I'm aware of your thoughts on it that, you know, your retirement should always come
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.340]   first and that's what I have been focusing on.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:37.300]   And so I believe now that, you know, I'll be able to fully fund whatever the pre-tax
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:42.140]   opportunities are as far as my retirement income goes.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:48.740]   So I would like to think about 529 versus taxable, and I know taxable would always have
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.940]   more flexibility.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.300]   And so I kind of feel conflicted here.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:58.420]   You know, I come from a background where parents traditionally fund their children's education
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:12:59.900]   with no obligation whatsoever.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.380]   This is kind of a thing that you do, everybody does, but then now I'm in a different country
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.980]   where I also want them to have skin in the game, so to speak.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.340]   You know, at least those are my views right now.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.500]   Well you're conflicted and I'm conflicted.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.220]   So let me give you my two answers.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.180]   If I were a financial planner and you were my client and we were speaking strictly in
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:29.540]   a professional context, then the way that I would answer it is everything that you said,
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.620]   okay, are you on track for retirement?
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.420]   We would talk through, do you have debt?
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.180]   Do you have other uses of the money, et cetera?
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.580]   And you would say to me, no, Joshua, we're in good track.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.500]   I'm well employed.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.540]   My financials are on track.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:45.580]   Then I would just say, well, what kind of school would you guess would be appropriate
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.200]   for your daughters?
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.820]   And you would say, well, the University of Tennessee.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.540]   And so I would say, well, what's the current cost of Tennessee?
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.300]   And you would say, I want to fund it at 50 percent.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.380]   We would basically just say, let's do some calculations and put some money in.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:04.060]   That's the only answer in terms of a financial planning answer.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.700]   So that's the technical answer.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.900]   And basically you just stick some money in and you hope that it works out.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:15.940]   I'm conflicted because I have an ideological block on this particular topic.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:24.900]   And my ideological block is I see that college has changed and is changing.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:32.180]   And I look at my young children and I cannot believe that I would send my children to any
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:40.020]   mainstream college with the exception of a hard science approach, something like engineering,
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.940]   mathematics, chemistry, that type of thing.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.460]   That's about the only thing that I would ever send my children to.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:52.140]   Everything else, as far as kind of just the mainstream approach to college, is just such
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.140]   a waste.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.780]   I mean, it's an ideological swamp.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:01.980]   And so the only exception for me is, OK, is there a hard science?
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.060]   And when I look at that and I look at about all the ways to get college for cheap, I can't
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:11.740]   imagine sending my children into kind of the traditional, hey, let's go off to – for
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.820]   you, maybe the University of Tennessee or let's go off to the University of Florida.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:20.460]   I mean college these days is just such a cesspool that I look at it and I just can't even
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:28.340]   – I can't fathom myself ever wanting to encourage my children to wander into that
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.340]   filth.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:35.620]   And so I have this massive ideological block around the idea of funding college.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.460]   And that's what I tried to share in those shows, to say here's the technical answer
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.140]   to that.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:43.820]   So then the other thing is I look at the pace of change around.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:48.300]   I look at the deep dissatisfaction that my generation has with college.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:53.620]   I look at the data that still indicates that educational attainment has a high correlation
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.700]   on earning ability, lower unemployment among people who have college degrees, et cetera.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.340]   But I look at how fast the market is changing technologically and I look at the impact.
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:07.020]   And I'm convinced, especially since you have a three-year-old and a nine-month-old,
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.780]   I'm convinced that in the next 15 years, the world of education is going to be turned
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   on its head.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:21.660]   There have been movements happening under things, but these movements are picking up
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   steam.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.980]   And so I think the momentum is there that in 15 years, the college environment is going
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   to be unrecognizable.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.500]   So I have this major – there's your professional answer first and then frankly I have this
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:37.540]   ideological block that says I think the whole thing is a worthless waste of time.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.540]   Okay.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540]   Okay.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:45.260]   Well, that helps in a way that – I mean, I may – I mean, lately what I have been
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.500]   – I kind of go back and forth, but lately I have been leaning – yes, I may be missing
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:56.220]   out on some tax-free growth, but taxable is what would give me the best flexibility as
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:03.340]   far as use of money goes, whether it is unfold need of me, my wife, or my kids, you know,
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.500]   or whether it would require – if you would have asked me 10 years ago whether I would
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.980]   move to this country, I would have said no, and I'm here now and I plan to stay here.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.740]   And who would know what would happen, you know, by the time they would be off college.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.020]   So maybe that is what I would do.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:22.900]   The second question I have, and I know this is probably something that you would point
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.620]   me in the right direction, but that is what I'm looking for here.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:34.220]   I'm originally from India, and in India there is a big whole life insurance market with
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.660]   life insurance corporation, which is backed by government of India security, so it's
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.980]   very solid.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:44.700]   I do have a substantial amount of different type of whole life insurance policy there,
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.700]   which I do contribute.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:50.540]   I'm on a second year, and up to three years they have no cash values.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:58.180]   My main concerns with those are I'm very – with financial regulation being tightened up, when
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:05.180]   I got it, nobody was ever tracking what happens and how it goes, and I was not aware of that.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:11.700]   But with increasing financial scrutiny, and I know how whole life insurance taxable thing
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:18.140]   works over here, I need some direction to find out answers about how do I need to report
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:21.300]   this if I do need to report whole life insurance policy.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.260]   I did look up IRS website and initially said, well, all your foreign account, if it has
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:31.140]   a collective of $10,000 or more, including surrender value of your whole life policy
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:35.860]   needs to be reported, but I'm not in that territory, but I would be there in a year
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:42.380]   or two, and I tried to ask around here in town to see if any particular CPA would have
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:47.540]   background dealing with something like this, and I ended up – everybody offers their
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.580]   service, but they don't necessarily have background or expertise that would make me
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.900]   feel comfortable with their answer.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:59.740]   So any – I don't know if you are aware or if you have any direction where I can find
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.940]   the appropriate resource to think what to do with this.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:08.060]   So let me make sure I understand the situation.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:14.520]   You own a whole life insurance contract that is slowly accumulating cash value, and it's
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.300]   an Indian contract that you purchased while you were in India from an Indian-based life
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.300]   insurance company.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.940]   You've now moved to the United States, and are you a citizen or are you on track to become
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:26.940]   a citizen of the US?
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.580]   Shailesh Kumar The latter part.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.580]   Tavish Yehuda Okay.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.820]   So you expect to become a citizen of the US, and as a US citizen in time – well, as a
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:41.060]   US citizen, you're now going to be subject to the full range of IRS regulation, and because
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:50.500]   the IRS requires for US citizens the reporting of foreign-held financial assets, you're
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:55.540]   trying to figure out if you need to report the value of your Indian whole life insurance
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.660]   contract to the IRS on the appropriate forms?
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.980]   Is that an accurate summary?
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.740]   Shailesh Kumar Yes.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.260]   And also if it would make – the reason I got this whole life policy because there were
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:09.540]   a whole lot of taxable benefit if I would have stayed in India.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.380]   The incentives were good, tax-free, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:18.980]   But I don't know if me staying in US, whether my whole life policy would be treated from
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:25.060]   India would be treated in the same way as if those whole life policy would be one that
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.340]   I obtained in US.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:32.300]   And so I also want to see that at some point would it make sense to just surrender it for
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:38.340]   simplification, and then maybe it would not be treated in a tax-advantaged fashion in
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:43.060]   US, and actually I would be better off investing that money.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.500]   Anyway, I do make a sizable contribution every year on those, so.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.060]   Trevor Burrus: Right.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:55.540]   What an interesting question.
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:01.160]   So do you have other accounts in India or other aspects of your financial life that
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.380]   continues to be in India?
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   Shailesh Kumar Yes.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:10.680]   Well, I do have an RE account which I had to open essentially to fund this policy.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.300]   But that's pretty much it.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:17.060]   Trevor Burrus: And you intend to be in the United States, the best you can discern your
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.620]   intention now is to be a long-term resident of the United States?
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.620]   Shailesh Kumar Correct.
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.620]   Trevor Burrus: Okay.
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:31.020]   Well, do you continue to believe that this life insurance policy that you own is a good
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.080]   and valuable asset for you?
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.100]   Or at this point, do you look at it and say, "Well, not really"?
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:41.020]   Shailesh Kumar I think it's a good and valuable asset.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:48.300]   But a huge unknown is how the earnings on it will be treated when it would start paying
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.500]   off.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.940]   And that's a huge uncertainty.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.740]   You know, if it would be treated in a way that whole life policy earning would be, then
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.220]   it absolutely does make sense to me.
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:03.300]   If it doesn't, and it would just put me up on the radar for IRS audit, then it probably
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.940]   does not.
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:12.180]   So that's the unknown for me, like how this policy would – earning from the policy would
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.380]   be treated here in the United States.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.980]   Marc Thiessen So here's the best consideration that I can
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   give you.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.120]   It is an interesting and complicated question, but here's the best analysis that I could
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.120]   give you.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.740]   I would start with the question of, is this a valuable asset?
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:36.220]   Because there's no point in your – if you have an asset that stinks and it's just
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:42.260]   a piece of junk, you made a bad investment, then under that context, you cut your losses
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.420]   and sell it and move on and find something better to do with the money.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:53.020]   If it's a valuable asset though, then you want to – then there's no reason to rock
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.180]   the boat.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.980]   So my first question, is this a valuable asset?
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:05.820]   And part of that kind of a corollary is, is this a valuable asset given my changing tax
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   situation?
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.860]   And that's kind of probably the key thing because you purchased it planning to be governed
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:16.100]   by Indian tax law, but now you're governed by US-American tax law.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:20.500]   And so the attributes of that may – have changed.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:24.080]   You're subject to a different system, so the attributes of that have changed.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.640]   So I would ask that question and that may be useful to you to analyze.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.120]   Let's say that for sake of just numbers that are inaccurate but useful to the conversation.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.620]   Let's say you were previously looking at it and saying, "I was going to get what
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.840]   would be the equivalent of a 10 percent annual rate of return on my asset."
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.340]   That would be great.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:49.760]   But that was a 10 percent effective return net of taxes because of the tax value of the
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.760]   contract.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.960]   But now I'm actually getting a zero percent rate of return.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.560]   Well, in that context, dump the investment and move on to something else where you can
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.480]   at least get a better return.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.780]   And so that tax consideration will be substantial.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:08.240]   With regard to the IRS, I'm not scared of foreign reporting requirements.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.100]   I think I hate them.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.200]   In terms of ideologically, I hate them.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.080]   I don't see what business the IRS has with you and your money.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.220]   But I am in the minority and I'm just basically a clanging gong in the street.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:26.920]   For some reason, the US voting base thinks that the IRS is God and deserves to know about
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.360]   every minute detail of your financial life.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   So I hate it but I'm not scared of it.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.720]   The reality is that there are these requirements that if you hold foreign assets, you are required
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.960]   to report them.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.000]   But I haven't heard any evidence or any even allegations.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   Maybe they're out there.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   I haven't looked.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.440]   But I haven't heard any evidence or allegation that holding foreign assets would be a risk.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.560]   And I recommend to people frequently that they internationally diversify their assets.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.160]   I think it's a good idea.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.960]   I get uncomfortable with the idea of having all of my assets in one country.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.480]   And now we have to be practical about this.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.580]   There's no reason for somebody who is just getting started and has no money to worry
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.960]   about opening a Swiss bank account.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:18.360]   But as your wealth grows and as your assets grow, I think it's imprudent to keep all of
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:24.120]   your assets under one particular country, under one particular tax entity.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.240]   Now I think there's an appropriate and prudent way to engage in international diversification.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.200]   And unfortunately for US citizens, the price of entry is to file your FBAR forms, your
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.880]   report of foreign bank and financial accounts, your FBAR forms every year with what you have.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.960]   So I'm not scared of filing it and I wouldn't dump the policy just because I now have to
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   file the FBAR form.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:53.080]   I would actually look at your having assets in India as a useful part of your overall
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.440]   financial life.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:01.400]   The most natural way for you to diversify your holdings internationally is to invest
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.880]   and keep assets in a financial system that you know where you have contacts.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.380]   I would guess you have family, friends, et cetera.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.240]   And so for you, the most natural way for you to have that international diversification
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:19.320]   would still be to maintain a simple but not insubstantial financial life in India even
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.080]   though you're planning to be a long-term resident of the United States.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   >>Corey: Okay.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   Very good.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:31.240]   And so for that second question, how change in the – or current change in the tax situation
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:40.080]   affects what effective rate of return would be, who can – I have tried to call IRS helpline.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.840]   I reached out to the agent I have in India, but both of them have very limited knowledge
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.560]   about what is pertinent in their part of world without the other part of world.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:57.320]   And so I want somebody who can take – who has an interest and can come up with solid
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:02.760]   advice on this is what your policy looks like, this is the current tax system looks like,
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.360]   and this is what it means when we connect two dots.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   Where do I start?
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:12.520]   Because local – one or two local CPAs I reached out to, of course, they are willing
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.400]   to provide services, but when I ask them, "Have you done," not necessarily for somebody
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.360]   living in India, but this type of work before, they were not able to give me any reference
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.360]   or so forth.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.760]   So I don't know whom can I ask that question or what type of resources I can reach out
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.800]   so that I can answer that question for myself.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.400]   >>Steve: I doubt the person exists.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.460]   If they did exist, the only place I could imagine them existing would be somebody who
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:46.600]   is servicing the mega wealthy Indian American community, and I mean mega wealthy.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:53.320]   There may be somebody who has established a boutique accounting and financial advice
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.440]   practice and they work with the mega wealthy.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.480]   But in terms of just a rank and file person, I doubt they exist.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.160]   And so frankly, you're going to be the best person to do it.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.800]   Here's how I would approach it.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.040]   Don't be scared of the government officials.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.920]   Don't be scared of the IRS.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.000]   The IRS – if you call the IRS, they're not going to have a clue about the answer
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.520]   and they're especially not going to have a clue about the answer of anybody that's
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.420]   going to be sitting on a phone bank.
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:30.560]   There may be some highly advanced person in the IRS organization, but nobody sitting on
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.800]   a phone bank is going to be able to help you and your local revenue agent is not going
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.160]   to be – they're going to be nice about it, but they just don't know.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.320]   That's a very specialized question.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.400]   What I would do if I were you, do your best to read around as you've done and then just
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:49.160]   ask yourself the question, "OK, based upon my reading of this, as a reasonable person
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:54.200]   who is desiring to comply with the law as I understand it to be, what do I think is
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.620]   the answer?"
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.280]   And whatever you need to do, go with that because here's practically the situation.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:05.400]   The IRS is going to have no knowledge of your assets in India with the exception of what
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.660]   you actually file with them in the forms.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:14.520]   There is no international tracking of every dollar and so they're going to have no knowledge
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.720]   of your assets except for what you file with them.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.960]   The workings of a life insurance contract especially are opaque to the banking industry.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.920]   It's unlike a retirement account.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.600]   For example, the assets that you have in a retirement account are sent off to the IRS
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.600]   every year.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.120]   But a life insurance contract doesn't have that connection and my guess is that the life
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.960]   insurance contract doesn't have that connection in India.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:42.740]   So this is an asset that is opaque to the government authorities until or unless something
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:43.740]   is done.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.680]   In the United States, whole life insurance contracts, growth and the value is not reported.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.280]   It's not reportable in any way.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.060]   That's one of the benefits of a whole life insurance contract.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:59.340]   So I think the only burden or responsibility that's on you is to say as a prudent person,
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.860]   what's my best guess at this?
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   What's my best approach?
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.540]   Chances are you'll never have any interaction with the IRS.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:09.500]   The audit rate for people with the IRS is minute.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:14.460]   I think if memory is right, it's under 1% of returns I think that are ever audited.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:20.360]   Most of those audits, if my memory is right, are kind of automated letters back and forth.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:27.900]   You'll never sit down with a revenue agent who has any knowledge of Indian tax law.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.540]   And it's just – it's inconceivable.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:37.460]   Now if you are some kind of magical criminal underlord – or sorry, overlord and you've
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.660]   earned $4 billion in rupees last year and now you're trying to figure out, "Well,
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:42.660]   how do I hide the money?"
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.020]   Well, now you might wind up in tax court and have to do it.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:52.360]   But I think you're giving the IRS and the Indian version of the IRS far more credit.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.340]   This is going to be irrelevant for you.
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.180]   Just do your best as a prudent, honest person so you can sit before the revenue agent and
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.700]   you can say, "Here's what I'm doing.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.980]   I'm reporting it on these forms as you specified here.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.920]   Here are the situation."
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.140]   And I think that's the best that they can expect.
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.820]   I mean you didn't set out to create these complicated laws.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.820]   They did.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:17.900]   But I think the best that anybody can expect is for you to do your best honestly, uprightly,
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:21.020]   to read the law and do your best to follow it.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.220]   Everything beyond that is not worth worrying about.
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.220]   Okay.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.220]   All right.
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.220]   Well, that helps.
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.860]   I will keep you posted on that.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:30.860]   Thank you.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:36.580]   It is an interesting question and I have found a number of those interesting kind of expatriate
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.300]   solutions.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.380]   There is a business opportunity.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.860]   I'm convinced, a business opportunity especially in the current world where it's much easier
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.100]   to target your listeners.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:51.500]   But if you have an interest in accounting or an interest in financial advice and if
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:59.900]   you have an ethnic background or an experience, if you're an Indian-American or American-Indian,
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:07.380]   whichever way, if you have this connection and cross-border knowledge, you can become
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:12.740]   an expert in both and you can do a ton of business with people who cross that line.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:17.420]   And remember, for most of these kinds of practices, you don't need that many customers.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:22.580]   But many people who are expatriates from another country maintain a financial life in both.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:28.660]   I remember a professor of mine in college was from one of the small countries in Africa,
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.700]   I forget which one, but he didn't invest in the United States.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.940]   He worked in the United States but all of his investments were at home.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:39.700]   He built out computer internet cafes and he had his friends and his family run them.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.500]   But he made great returns on his money but it was all invested back home.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:48.860]   And whether it's Canadian and US citizens who are living in the United States or in
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.020]   Canada and crossing the border and all of that, that's obviously a huge market.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:59.840]   Or if it's Rwandan, people from Rwanda and the United States, you can target these tiny
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.420]   little kind of expatriate communities very effectively with the internet.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:08.940]   And there are a lot of people like Girish who would have these kinds of questions that
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:09.940]   you could serve effectively.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.380]   So, there's a business idea for you if you're into that.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.980]   I think that's a pretty cool little option.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.340]   And if you're into travel, especially if you're part of that community, if you are Indian
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:24.140]   American, then I think you have a really powerful way where you can set up an identity, a business
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:31.460]   identity in both countries and you have an entirely plausible business to run that involves
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:36.820]   you going back and forth, seeing your family in your home country and also in your country
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.820]   of residence.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.140]   You have a really efficient way that you could set that up.
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.380]   So anyway, that's one idea, one thing I've thought of, one of my backup plans.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.380]   I share it with you.
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:50.420]   I have a boring ethnic history so I'm just a boring old US American.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.420]   But you never know.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.540]   Maybe I'll move to India someday.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:58.180]   I'll be back with you all soon.
