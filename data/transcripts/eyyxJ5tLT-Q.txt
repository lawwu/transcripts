[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   We talk worship lyrics on this podcast and you, listeners, are always sending us lyric questions,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.040]   which is maybe the most polarizing genre of episodes that we make. I'm sure most of you
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.560]   remember our episode on the contemporary worship song, "What a Beautiful Name," back in episode 1077,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.640]   or the lyrics of the worship song, "Reckless Love." We addressed those in episode 1202.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   Well, today a listener named Robert writes in to ask this, a more general question. "Hello,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.080]   Pastor John. I've noticed in my own church a rise in the lover language in our contemporary worship
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.320]   songs. Scripture shows that marriage and, in some ways, sexuality, reflects something of
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.280]   Christ's relationship with his people. Should we understand that in a purely corporate sense,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.960]   or is it right for individuals to sing words like, 'I have felt your touch,' or 'Jesus,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.640]   lover of my soul?' What place is there for the intimate, personal lover language in corporate
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680]   worship, and how much of this stems from allegorical interpretations of the Song of Solomon?"
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.400]   What a tremendous need there is for prayerful, wise, mature, experienced, Bible-saturated,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   theologically deep leaders of worship.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.680]   Yes. Amen.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.160]   Being able to play a guitar or a piano and carry a tune is not enough to fit a person
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:33.600]   for one of the most important pastoral roles in the church. I think after the pastor who preaches
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.040]   regularly, the designer and leader of worship services is the most spiritually and theologically
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.640]   influential person in the church, for better or for worse. And I begin with this emphasis,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.840]   this call for prayerful, wise, mature, Bible-saturated depth and discernment in that role,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.360]   because, as with most beautiful and precious things, the remedy for unfitting, inappropriate,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.600]   foolish, tasteless things in worship services is not a rulebook, but maturity and wisdom
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.840]   and the gifts of discerning proportion and balance and beauty and effect.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.040]   So, when Robert asks, "What place is there for the intimate, personal lover language
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   in corporate worship?" my answer is, "Each pastoral worship leader must discern whether
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.240]   the wording of a song and its context in worship will provide the mental and emotional setting
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   for experiencing love language in a way that is pure and holy and in fitting proportion to other
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.040]   emotions as well." You can see the enormous need for wisdom here. This is not simple.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.720]   The more sexual and individual the imagery of Christ and the people of Christ become,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   the more problematic it will be for corporate worship, first because it's a challenge to
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:33.760]   transpose eroticism into spiritual affections. It can be done, but it is not likely that it will
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:42.640]   be done for most average people in corporate worship. Second, because Jesus Christ is a male,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   a man, and we can't expect males and females in the congregation to relate in the same way to an
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.720]   individualized male Christ speaking to them in language that carries erotic overtones.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.240]   But I don't want to give the impression that we should allow the lowest common denominator
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:18.000]   of spiritual sensitivity and personal intimacy of fellowship with Christ to dictate the limits
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   of our biblical expressions of affections for God. Again, the call for wisdom and spiritual
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.840]   depth in the leader and discernment is so crucial. Here's what I think the focus should be
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:44.800]   that would help solve these kinds of problems. Are the excellencies of Christ seen and savored
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.480]   by the people week in, week out in worship in a way that guards every one of these excellencies
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:04.000]   of Christ from disproportion by keeping it in relation to its counter-excellency?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.240]   I know that sounds complicated. It's not. Here's what I mean. We must sing the excellence of His
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.760]   glory but mingled with His humility. We must sing of His transcendence
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.040]   and mingled with His condescension. We admire Him for His uncompromising justice, but even more
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.760]   because He's tempered with mercy. We admire Him for His majesty, but even more because it's a
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.840]   majesty in meekness, lion and lamb. We admire Him because of His equality with God, but even more
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.240]   because as God's equal, yet He has a reverence for God. We admire Him because of how worthy He is
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.880]   of all good, but even more because a patient He was to suffer all evil. We sing of Him because
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.960]   of His sovereign dominion over the world, but even more because of His dominion clothed in a spirit
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.920]   of obedience and submission. We love the way He stumped the proud Pharisees and scribes with His
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.600]   wisdom, and we love it even more because He could be so simple that children wanted to come near Him
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.120]   and spend time with Him. We admire Him because He could still the storm with a word, and yet
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.560]   He refused to use His power to come down from the cross. So when Robert asks, "Is it right
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:50.080]   for individuals to sing words like, 'I have felt your touch'?" my answer is, "Yes, provided everyone
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.960]   knows that when you feel His touch, you might be electrocuted." That awareness might keep the
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.240]   imagery of Christ's touch from drifting into sentimentalism or eroticism. So much depends
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.560]   on what the words of a song connote in our particular personal experience. When I think
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.360]   myself, when I think of being touched by God, touched by God, I think of 1 Samuel 10:26. I
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.000]   really did. When I was working through this, that's what I thought of. Saul also went to his
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.560]   home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. That's gonna touch
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:47.200]   how what? That's a very different connotation than the first night of the honeymoon. So my plea to
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   pastors is that they choose with great care who will design and lead this all-important part of
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:06.160]   the worship serviceâ€”prayerful, wise, mature, experienced, Bible-saturated, theologically deep
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.600]   people. And if there isn't a person like that, then, Pastor, keep the leadership in your own
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:24.480]   hands until you raise up such a leader. And in the meantime, teach your people who Christ is
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.000]   and what worship is. Thank you, Pastor John. And if you want more from Pastor John on

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.240]   three times a week. And next time we address a heavy topic. It's the topic of a pastor who came
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.520]   out publicly to say he was deconverting from Christianity, leaving the gospel, and abandoning
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   Christ. How should we respond to such a heavy, heavy moment? I'm your host Tony Renke, and we'll
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.240]   see you on Wednesday.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:20.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
