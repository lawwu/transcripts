[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.440]   This episode was jointly hosted
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.000]   by the Starting Out Life Stage
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.040]   and the South Florida Local Chapter
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120]   and recorded August 10th, 2021.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.040]   It features longtime Boglehead 5K,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.360]   discussing investment funding priorities,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.360]   including investment locations and tax efficiency.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.480]   Bogleheads are investors
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.640]   who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.280]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.800]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   - With a presentation by 5K
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.220]   on prioritizing the investment order,
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.360]   the Bogleheads is a term intended to honor Jack Bogle.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   Mr. Bogle created the first index fund
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480]   for retail investors and is the founder of Vanguard.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   But Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   or use the investing advice that Mr. Bogle advocated.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.360]   And that investing advice, as you know,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.400]   is invest early and often,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.720]   develop your workable investing plan,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   never trying to time the market,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240]   use index funds when possible,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.560]   diversify, keep it simple,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.200]   minimize taxes with cost-efficient investing,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.840]   and above all, to stay the course with your plan,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.360]   both in bull and bear markets,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.400]   just keep saving and just keep investing.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.920]   And this is where 5K's presentation tonight
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.080]   will be so useful, developing the plan.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.120]   I would also like to introduce my co-moderators tonight.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.480]   We have Carol from the pre-retirement chapter
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.000]   and the Dallas chapter.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.940]   And we have Jim, who you just heard from Chicago.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.760]   We talked about the recording of the meeting.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.980]   When the presentation is over again,
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.200]   we will stop recording.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.240]   We'll have a big question and answer.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.960]   However, 5K, if he wants to, he can answer questions.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   He has told us he will answer questions
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400]   during his presentation if he doesn't feel
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.120]   that it affects his flow of his presentation.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760]   So you can put your questions in the chat.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   And Carol and Jim will, or 5K, will address those questions.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.520]   Let me see.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.720]   Thank you.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.840]   I'd like to introduce Gail Cox, who is here.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   Gail is the BOGO head who created the LifeStage investing,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.360]   the LifeStage chapters of the BOGO heads.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.900]   And we thank her for that.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.000]   Okay, on to our presentation.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   5K is a long-time BOGO head
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   who posts regularly on the forum.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.560]   He has many, many helpful posts.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.720]   He's kind, competent, answering questions
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.680]   from newbies and oldies, and we appreciate.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.640]   And he's especially good on portfolio creation
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   and tax-efficient fund placement.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.600]   He also has his personal financial toolbox,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.720]   which is a huge spreadsheet.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.640]   And he has also already given a presentation on that,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   and you can find it on the BOGO head blog.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.440]   I believe it was in March.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.360]   Okay, 5K, welcome, and please, the stage is yours.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   - Thank you, Miriam.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.840]   So everything that's going to be covered here verbally,
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.860]   pretty much you can find in various websites.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.560]   The presentation will have links to all of those.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.760]   So the presentation itself will, in PDF form,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.440]   be made available after the meeting.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   And these are not my ideas,
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.000]   as much as I'm just regurgitating
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.720]   what various groups of people have put together
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.080]   as these are some pretty good ideas
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.580]   that you might want to follow.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.640]   Okay, so I'll just start out with some general comments.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.040]   A lot of this is subjective.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.940]   Reasonable people can differ on the exact ordering.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.440]   Now, you can stretch that,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.360]   but you can't stretch that too far.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.040]   Some of the things that you'll find at the top of the list,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.200]   they belong there, and you don't want to switch them
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.680]   with things at the bottom of the list.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.660]   And we'll get to the lists shortly.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.700]   Sometimes the math is simple,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.440]   but the equation values themselves are somewhat speculative.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.120]   Like one example would be,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.740]   what do you think future tax rates will be
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.320]   when deciding traditional versus Roth?
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.080]   And then when we get into the risk versus reward,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.160]   you know, there is no deterministic answer.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   You can pay debt at a low known rate.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.760]   You can invest at a possibly higher,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.960]   but possibly lower rate.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.740]   And we'll get into that a little bit also.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.360]   And you know, other than the above,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.760]   this is all straightforward,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.400]   and that should be a winking emoji there.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   So it's not straightforward, but it's simple enough.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Okay, so this slide and the next slide
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.560]   are very high level views.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.880]   After these two slides,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.040]   we'll get into the details on these,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.680]   but this one is the picture view that you can see.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.960]   I'm not going to read things.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.760]   You can read the slide faster than I can talk through it.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.860]   There's some things that are high priority,
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.620]   things that are sort of in the middle,
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.260]   and then things that are relatively low priority.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   So that's the picture view.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.180]   You got your emergency fund, your employer match,
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.140]   your high interest debt.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.740]   Then you get into HSAs, IRAs, 401Ks,
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.080]   you know, the whole alphanumeric lexicon.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.180]   Then you get into the taxable accounts
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.680]   and the paying off debt.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.800]   I mentioned you can find these things on the internet.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   There's a couple of lists,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   and again, we're going to get into details on this.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.280]   So don't try to read the small print
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.440]   if you find it difficult.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.260]   The thing to note is all those green lines,
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.120]   they all match up.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.720]   So the two particular lists that I'm most familiar with,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.680]   the one in Bogleheads on prioritizing investments,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.760]   and there's a Mr. Money Mustache one called,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.680]   what is it, investment order.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.820]   They pretty much say the same thing.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.860]   They may say it in slightly different words.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.300]   So if one of them confuses you, try the other,
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.620]   and the wording may be different enough
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.220]   that it becomes understandable,
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.220]   but the concepts are identical.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.380]   Okay, so without further ado,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.360]   these are really the top three.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.860]   And these are all listed more or less in order.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.100]   So the top one would be the first thing to do,
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.000]   and the next one, the second and the third one, the third,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.300]   but you can mix and match.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.340]   So let me just go through these a little bit here.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.020]   So the emergency fund, lots of,
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.140]   so when we talk about emergency fund,
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.300]   we'll talk about traditional versus Roth later.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.860]   We'll talk about pay that versus invest.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.660]   Any one of these individual topics,
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.660]   we could spend an hour or two on.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.960]   So this is a high level view.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.580]   So the emergency fund, two-year satisfaction.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.420]   I think it's pretty non-controversial to say
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.420]   that you should give yourself at least enough buffer
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.660]   that you don't have to worry about bouncing checks
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.340]   from month to month.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.220]   So you need at least the next month's bills
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.940]   in your emergency fund.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.540]   Beyond that, do you need three months,
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.200]   six months, a year, two years?
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.420]   That's a personal thing, so two-year satisfaction.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.300]   Next one would be get the employer match.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.060]   If you've got a 401(k) or a 403(b)
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.460]   that's going to give you a one-for-one match
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.540]   or even a 50 cent per dollar match,
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.900]   that's the highest return you're gonna get.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.100]   Even in the next point, you've got credit cards,
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.900]   even if you're paying 20, 30% interest on your credit cards,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.720]   if you can get a one-for-one match from your employer,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.020]   that's a hundred percent.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.900]   But there is a reason why high interest debt,
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.900]   for example, credit cards is very high on the list here.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.660]   High is somewhat relative.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.420]   What's high for one person who's very risk tolerant
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.140]   might not be the same for someone who's more risk averse.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.400]   There's no right answer, it's personal finance.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.860]   And these mix and match.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.580]   So take the emergency fund
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.340]   and the paying off the credit card debts.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.220]   If you're sitting there with six months expenses
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.220]   in your emergency fund,
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.980]   but you owe $10,000 on a credit card
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.980]   that you're paying 25% per year interest on,
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.460]   you might call that credit card debt an emergency
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.700]   and dip into your emergency fund
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.500]   to wipe out the credit card debt.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.620]   So emergency funds are there to be used.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.860]   So if you've got something
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.100]   that you think qualifies as an emergency,
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.620]   go ahead and use it.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.380]   Now, if you're using your emergency fund
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.940]   to pay off your credit card every month,
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.500]   yeah, that's a different story.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.860]   Okay, so that's the top three.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.980]   Let me just stop here.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.520]   If there's any questions on those top three.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:55.300]   Anything in the chat I saw was flipping by too fast
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.740]   for me to concentrate on as I was giving the presentation,
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.140]   but are there any open questions at this point?
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.640]   All right.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.140]   Hearing none.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.940]   Going once, going twice.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.780]   All right.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.300]   We shall move on.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.460]   So the middle four, you can pay a tax now,
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.620]   you can pay it later, you can pay it never
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.780]   on these four options here.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.460]   So the first one and the reason why it is the first one
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.580]   with a health savings account,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.260]   if you're eligible for one,
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.580]   and again, we can get into gory details
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.380]   on what makes one eligible for a health savings account
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.340]   in terms of having a high deductible health plan.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.300]   But if you're eligible,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.660]   you get a tax deduction on your contribution.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.940]   You don't pay tax unless you live in what,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.300]   California and is it New Jersey or just California,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.180]   but you don't pay tax on any gains.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.100]   And then when you take it out to pay for medical expenses.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:05.540]   Somebody.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.680]   Okay, so it is California and New Jersey.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.260]   But the other 48, they're a great deal.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.660]   They're even a good deal in California and New Jersey.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.980]   They're just not as great.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.340]   Okay, so that's the one,
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.300]   sometimes you hear them referred to as triple tax-free,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.380]   you get the tax deduction,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.300]   you don't pay tax on annual gains
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.560]   and then you don't pay tax
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   if you take it out for medical expense.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.740]   So then we get the next two,
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.740]   the traditional or Roth IRA and the employer plans.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.420]   And again, remember where the employer plans,
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   the top three or the employer plan showed up,
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.240]   that was just up to getting the match,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.940]   the maximum employer match.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.660]   So this would be going up to the IRS limit,
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.060]   the 19,500 for 401ks.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.140]   But the reason that the traditional or Roth IRA
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.240]   comes before the employer plans on this list,
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.460]   and you see there's a double-headed arrow,
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.460]   so they can swap, but IRAs tends to have lower fees
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.500]   and almost by definition, they have more investing options.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.780]   So if they have a lower fee than your 401k,
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.780]   your 403b offer, then go with the IRA first.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.300]   But they don't always have lower fees.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.860]   Sometimes you get institutional funds in 401ks
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.280]   and hey, just fill up the 401k.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.660]   And sometimes you want to use the 401k
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.900]   because it can reduce your modified adjusted gross income
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.620]   for something like the earned income tax credit,
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.620]   whereas the IRA may not be as efficient at doing that.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.860]   So the IRA and the 401k,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.020]   yeah, the default order is IRA first,
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.220]   but there's plenty of examples where you would want to do
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.220]   the 401k or 403b or 457 ahead of the IRA.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.860]   And then you get into,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.340]   for those who happen to have it available,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.580]   typically if you work for a large company
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   and they offer an after-tax non-Roth 401k option,
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.280]   you can do something called the mega backdoor Roth process.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.280]   Which is a little bit different
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.800]   from the plain old backdoor Roth process
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.160]   you see in the second bullet point,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.240]   but it does get after-tax funds into a Roth account
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.760]   instead of a taxable account.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.520]   So that's a good deal.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.360]   There was a comment, yeah,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   there's another example on MAGI of healthcare subsidies.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.760]   That may be another reason
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.640]   that you'd want to use a 401k in preference to an IRA.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.520]   And all of these are if you have to make a choice.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.120]   If you're in the wonderful position
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.080]   that you've got enough disposable cash
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   that you can fill all these up, well then great.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.840]   It doesn't, you know, the order doesn't really matter.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:27.060]   Questions about that middle four
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.960]   or anything else at this point?
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   - Yes, I have a question 5k on the mega Roth.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.120]   You mentioned the mega Roth.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.560]   Can you explain what that is?
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.200]   - So if this is,
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.120]   so mega backdoor Roth is something
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.840]   that goes through an employer plan.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.320]   So 401k, 403b.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.760]   Most people are familiar with the concept.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   You can contribute to a traditional account in your 401k.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.400]   And when I say 401k, just assume that I mean, or 403b.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.720]   You can contribute to a traditional account
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.000]   or a Roth account.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.280]   Those are, you can elect which one to do.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.160]   There's a third option that some employers offer,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.400]   not all, but some.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.300]   And that is after tax non-Roth.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.060]   So you can contribute after tax,
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.660]   but it's not immediately going into a Roth account.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.740]   And it sits there, it's like a non-deductible
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.880]   traditional IRA contribution.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.860]   So that's nice, but not all that interesting
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.500]   unless the employer plan also allows you
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   to take that non-deductible after tax account
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.140]   and roll that over to either the Roth version
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.360]   of the Roth account within the 401k,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.140]   or if the employer plan allows you
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.240]   to distribute that out to a Roth IRA.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.780]   So you make this after tax non-Roth contribution
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.740]   where if you don't do anything with it, it just sits there.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.220]   You're not paying any tax on any gains
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.420]   while it's sitting there, but when you withdraw it,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.220]   you now pay tax on the gains at ordinary income rates,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.980]   unless you have the option to take that account
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.540]   and roll it over immediately, or within a month or two,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.540]   or even a year into a Roth 401k or Roth IRA.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.180]   And there's a whole, there's two wiki entries,
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.180]   one on after tax 401k, one on the mega backdoor Roth process.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.620]   So they're related, but not identical.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.100]   Does that cover it in enough detail?
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.760]   - Yes, but does that mean that the mega Roth,
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.460]   it's a mega 401k, correct?
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.140]   Mega 401k Roth, that it differs
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   from your regular 401k Roth, regular 401k.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.980]   Your regular Roth 401k on the taxing of the earnings.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:29.620]   - Correct, so there's, where do I start?
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.020]   I'll start with the processes.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.820]   So there's a backdoor Roth process,
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.780]   which involves multiple steps.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.880]   And there's a mega backdoor Roth process
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.420]   that also involves multiple steps,
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.860]   but the two of them are different.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.460]   The regular backdoor Roth process
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.420]   refers to what you do with IRAs.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.700]   The mega backdoor Roth process
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.880]   refers to what you do with your 401k.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.840]   So the process for both of them involves,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.160]   you make a non-deductible contribution.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.080]   So it goes into an account.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.900]   You did not get to deduct that contribution from your taxes,
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.220]   but if it stays in that account while it grows,
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.300]   you won't be paying any taxes.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.380]   But when you go to withdraw from that account,
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.900]   you'll pay tax at ordinary income rates on any gains.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.260]   So up to this point, if you put it in the account,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.140]   you didn't get to deduct it, it's growing,
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.100]   you're not paying tax, but then when it comes out,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.700]   you have to pay tax on any gains.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.140]   Kind of interesting, but maybe not all that interesting.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.620]   What makes it very interesting
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:58.260]   is if you can take that non-deductible amount
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.100]   and then convert it immediately to a Roth account.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.680]   So when you do that conversion,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.660]   if there hasn't been any gains,
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.400]   you're not going to pay any tax,
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.540]   but now you've got it into a Roth account
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.420]   where you'll never pay any tax on it.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:24.700]   So you've got, people sometimes say,
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.740]   I'm going to put it in my backdoor Roth account,
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.060]   or I'm going to use my mega backdoor Roth account,
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.240]   which is playing a little fast and loose with the language.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.600]   Those backdoor things are processes
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.900]   that involve a contribution to a non-deductible account
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.180]   and then a conversion to a Roth account.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:52.300]   - Does the mega backdoor,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   does the mega backdoor Roth stay in your employer plan
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.900]   until you take it out and you roll it over to a regular IRA?
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.420]   Is that correct?
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.660]   - I'll give you a definite maybe on that one.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   It depends on your employer's plan.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:22.540]   Some employers allow you to roll it into a Roth,
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.500]   into your Roth 401k account.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.580]   Some employers allow you to do what's called
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.740]   an in-service distribution,
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.700]   and you can get it out of the 401k completely
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.420]   and into a Roth IRA.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.860]   Either one of those is perfectly fine.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.260]   It really doesn't matter as long as your employer plan
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.320]   allows you to do either one.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.980]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.580]   - You're welcome.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.140]   All right.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.420]   Anything else on this before I move along?
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.300]   - Okay, I think there was a question in the chat.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.440]   What tax bracket should use a Roth 401k
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.560]   versus a regular 401k?
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.400]   - Oh, okay.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.500]   Let me go back to...
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   So even when the math is simple,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.660]   equation values may be speculative.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:22.580]   It really, it doesn't matter what your current tax bracket is
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.420]   as much as it matters how does that compare
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.900]   to what you think your future marginal tax rate will be.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.700]   And you notice I use marginal tax rate instead of bracket,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.500]   and I really should use that.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.580]   Depends on what your current marginal tax rate would be,
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.140]   which for some people is their nominal bracket amount,
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.240]   but for others, it's not.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.100]   You need to compare that to what you think it will be
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.080]   in the future.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:59.280]   So we can go after I'm...
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.040]   So this presentation is mostly on the investment order.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.240]   We can certainly go into Roth versus traditional
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.780]   after this one is done.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.060]   And as I said, we can take at least an hour on that alone,
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.840]   but maybe we can keep it a little shorter than that.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   But there is no...
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.820]   I mean, there's sort of rules of thumb,
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.440]   but I really don't like rules of thumb
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.920]   in traditional versus Roth
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.540]   because there's a huge number of exceptions to them.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.060]   And one rule of thumb would be,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.120]   well, if you're in the highest tax bracket, use traditional.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   Well, that's a great rule of thumb
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.680]   unless you're gonna stay in the highest tax bracket
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.100]   even after retirement, and then you should use Roth.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.680]   Another decent rule of thumb
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.960]   is if you're in the 12% bracket or lower,
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.280]   if you're in 12% bracket, use Roth.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.840]   And that's a pretty good rule of thumb
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   unless this is someone who's late to the party
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.340]   and they're in their fifties and haven't had much saved
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.560]   and probably never gonna pay tax in retirement.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.040]   So they should use traditional.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.680]   So I just, I don't like rules of thumb
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.200]   because there's too many exceptions
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.240]   when it comes to traditional versus Roth.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.300]   Again, that's a personal opinion.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:14.620]   Okay, any other questions before I go on?
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.920]   All right.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.640]   Okay, so now we're kind of towards the bottom
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.560]   of the prioritization list
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.700]   and we've taken care of the top ones.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.480]   You know, get your house in order
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.120]   so that you're not bouncing checks
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.280]   and get that employer match
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.680]   that 100% return on your investment.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.560]   Get those credit cards paid off
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.200]   and we're through all of the tax advantaged options,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.320]   the HSAs, the IRAs, the 401Ks.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.400]   So now we're down to, okay, do I invest
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.600]   or do I pay off debt that I have?
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.880]   Good question.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.280]   So in the Bogle Hedge Wiki,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.120]   you'll see there's three bullet points,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   pay off medium interest,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.960]   then invest taxably,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.440]   then pay off low interest.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.480]   It's a little tough
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.220]   since there is no maximum on taxable investment.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.000]   You could reasonably ask,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.440]   how do you ever get to paying off low interest debt?
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.560]   That's a good question.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.200]   You can think of those two maybe as parallel
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.880]   rather than one right after the other.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.240]   And it gets into your risk tolerance
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.080]   or your risk aversion,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.360]   just how do you define things?
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.080]   So there's one definition of medium interest debt
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.640]   that you'll find over on the Money Mustache one.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.160]   And again, it's just a definition,
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.560]   3% over the 10-year treasury note yield,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.200]   which 10-year treasury has been what,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.960]   about one and a quarter percent
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.320]   averaging over the past year.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   So I might say medium would be over four and a quarter.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   So that would say 5% would be medium interest debt
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.640]   and you ought to pay that off.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.000]   And 4% that'd be low interest debt.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.880]   So you should invest taxably.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.760]   And some people would say, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.680]   Other people would say 5%.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.640]   Man, that's pretty low.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.280]   I think I'm gonna earn more than that.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.880]   I'm in this for the long haul.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.960]   I'm 100% stocks, away I go.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   Other people would say 4%.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.720]   Gee, that's a great return.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.160]   That's a guaranteed investment return.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.320]   I'm all for that.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.600]   I'm gonna pay off the debt before I invest.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.400]   And so it's personal,
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.640]   but these are some of the things
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.000]   that you might wanna think about
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.520]   when you're making your personal decision.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.160]   Other considerations that often pop up with questions,
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.760]   a common question is where do you put saving
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   for a house down payment in this ordering?
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.240]   That's really up to you.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.320]   You can either say, hey, we really want the house.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.520]   We're gonna consider this a day-to-day expense
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.560]   like going out and buying groceries,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.160]   food, clothing, and eventual better shelter.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.200]   So we will do that.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.520]   That's just something that we're not gonna consider
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.880]   that an investment that's at risk.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   We're gonna go buy chicken and potatoes and milk
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.400]   and then we're gonna put a bunch into our down payment fund.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   Or people can say, okay, we're renting here
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.680]   or we've got an okay house and we'll invest.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.560]   And if things work out,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.440]   we'll take money out of investments later
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.080]   and buy a house or buy a bigger house,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.920]   but we're in no rush.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.720]   So again, either one of those is perfectly defensible.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.640]   Another question is where do 529 plans come into this?
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.680]   That's another personal thing.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.320]   I kinda like the analogy of do that only
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.040]   after your retirement plan is set.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.800]   Get your own oxygen mask on, then go assist others.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.520]   Another phrase that I've heard is you can borrow
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.840]   for college, but you can't borrow for your retirement.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.080]   But that's a personal thing.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.520]   Some people consider it extremely important
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.400]   to be able to pay their kids college.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.640]   So you have that as a higher priority.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.040]   And in all this, the ordering pretty much assumes
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   that you've got W-2 earnings or you're a contractor
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.520]   without, you don't own capital.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.160]   So you don't own a chain of dry cleaning stores
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.320]   or you don't own a food truck
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.440]   that you're looking to grow your business.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.600]   If you are self-employed in that way,
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.400]   if you own your own business,
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.320]   you really need to look and figure the return
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.600]   on your business investment and decide where that fits in.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.360]   With all the investment options of IRAs
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.720]   and solo 401ks and so forth and so on.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:30.200]   And that is it for the formal presentation
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.520]   on prioritizing investments.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   So where are we with questions?
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.040]   I see some long ones here.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.640]   - Chat asking, what's a reasonable amount
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.400]   to put per month into a 529 for young kids?
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:55.960]   - I don't have a good answer for that.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   If someone wants to opine on that, that depends.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.200]   Is your kid gonna go to Harvard
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.880]   and you wanna pay for all four years plus a PhD
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   and whatever, then you'd need to be putting
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.920]   in a heck of a lot.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.960]   Is your kid gonna go to enormous state university
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.560]   and is likely to get some sort of athletic scholarship?
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.680]   You probably don't need to put in as much.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.360]   That's a really personal one.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.800]   I don't have a good answer to that.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.400]   If anyone does, raise your hand or open your mic
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   and I'll be quiet for a bit here.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.440]   (mouse clicking)
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.360]   Well, one thing I would say is that the earlier
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.560]   you put the money into the 401k,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.480]   the more time it has to grow.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.840]   And so it's kind of like a front-loading.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.720]   I view it as kind of a front-loading effort to put as,
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.760]   I mean, I realize that saving for retirement is important,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.520]   more important, but if there's any way to front-load
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   the 529 early, then it has more time to grow.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.720]   It only has 18 years to grow.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.400]   The life of the 529 is shorter than the life
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.760]   of your retirement, your investing for retirement.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.800]   So it's kind of like a different type of an account.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   It sort of behaves a little different.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.160]   But most of the 529 plans do have a,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.040]   like a glide path similar to a target date refund
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.840]   or target date retirement fund,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.320]   where it will glide down to bonds.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.680]   So if you put your money in,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.800]   if you intend to put more money in towards the end
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.400]   of the 18 year period, you're going to be
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   in a more conservative portfolio,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.760]   or you're going to take more risk
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   that the market will drop before your child goes to college.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   So I see a reason to front-load it as much as you can.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:17.800]   - Okay, there was a long post about after-tax money,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.840]   choice between regular taxable account
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   and Megabackdoor Roth, and RB suggests it's always better
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.560]   to use Megabackdoor Roth, and I would agree with that.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.560]   That's why it shows up in this middle four
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.400]   as opposed to the bottom three.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.240]   So yeah, we talked about,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.480]   you can sort of flip-flop some of these,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.720]   but I think that top three,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.280]   there's a pretty bright line between the top three
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.120]   and the middle four, and there's a pretty bright line
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.480]   between the middle four and the bottom three here.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.080]   I suppose someone might be able to come up
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.800]   with an exception, but I can't off the top of my head.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:13.280]   What else do we have in chat?
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.760]   529s, 529s.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.880]   - Okay, there's another question I can read out if you want.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.280]   It's from Deepak.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.360]   He said, "My state 529 plan has a state tax deduction.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.680]   I thought of this as a guaranteed return on my investment
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.640]   and hence prioritize it a little higher
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.160]   than my taxable accounts.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.760]   What are your thoughts on this?"
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   - Yeah, that's, if you're sure
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.320]   and you get to define the word sure,
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.480]   if you're sure that your kid's gonna go to college
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.800]   and you're gonna spend,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.200]   and you want to spend the money on that,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.360]   sure, that makes sense to do that.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.640]   What we've done personally,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.200]   well, we weren't really all that,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.760]   we were lucky with what we did on our personal finance.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.600]   Worked out okay,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   but we didn't really know what we were doing.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.320]   But what we do now with kids still going through college
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   is we put in the maximum 529 that we can
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.480]   to get the state tax break.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.840]   And then we take it right out the next year
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.320]   to use it for tuition and room and board.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.120]   So yeah, if you're in a state
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   that gives you a state tax break,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.720]   might as well take advantage of it.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   - And a while back, there was a question in the chat,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.200]   "If you don't plan to retire in the U.S.,
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.880]   how does any of this change, if at all?"
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   - Great question, and that would probably depend
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.600]   on where you're going to retire
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   and how that country treats IRAs and 401ks.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.640]   IRAs and 401ks in the U.S.,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   and I am absolutely not an expert on those,
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.920]   not even close to being moderately informed on those.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.480]   So someone else will have to weigh in on that.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:14.200]   - Okay, I actually had a question as well.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.400]   What if you sort of have low to medium interest debt
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.240]   somewhere in between, say like two and a half percent,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.680]   and you weren't really sure
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.280]   how things were gonna kind of go in the future,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.680]   would you focus on paying off the debt or investing,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.720]   or I guess, how would you make that decision
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.680]   if you really were unsure as to the trade-off there?
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:42.840]   - Well, one, you could follow these suggestions,
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.440]   and two and a half percent,
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.120]   the Bogle Hedge Wiki does not define high, medium, and low.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.720]   The Money Mustache one gives some suggestions,
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.080]   but I don't think it even pretends
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.200]   that those are wholly writ suggestions.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.280]   There are some guidelines.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.960]   So if we were to go with the definition of medium
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.600]   as being 3% over the 10-year treasury note yield,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.800]   and at one and a quarter percent roughly,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.920]   so medium would be four and a quarter percent.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.440]   So you said two and a half percent,
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.040]   so that's under four and a quarter,
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.560]   so that would be not medium interest debt,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.800]   that would be low interest debt.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.880]   And if you follow this ordering,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.440]   you'd never pay it off until you paid it off
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.720]   by paying it monthly.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.520]   But if you're staying up at night
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.000]   because you can't stand debt and you're losing sleep,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.680]   well, then maybe you wanna pay it off.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.000]   - Can I contribute something to that point as well?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.840]   - Sure.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   - It's rather helpful if you simplify that debt question.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.160]   So for instance, if you're paying two and a half percent
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.400]   in interest on any form of debt,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.320]   you can also look at that as a way to give yourself
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.000]   a two and a half percent raise on your income
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.080]   by eliminating that debt.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.760]   Furthermore, if you plan to invest
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.320]   while carrying the example two and a half percent debt,
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.200]   and let's say you're receiving a nominal,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   which is pre-inflation return, say 4%,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.640]   you're not really receiving that 4%,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.280]   'cause if you're paying two and a half percent on debt,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.560]   but receiving 4%, you could do the math
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.320]   and you tend to be spinning your wheel.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   So it's always prudent to pay off the debt first
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.440]   and then jump into investing to maximize those efforts.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   - That's one way to look at it.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.120]   Other people could say that they're not investing
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.360]   in bonds at all, and they expect their stock returns
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.200]   to be higher.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   So it's never say always, or how does that go?
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.200]   - We have a question.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.800]   - That's one thing I'm missing,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.000]   but if you take someone who's decided
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.920]   they wanna be 100% stocks and they're saying
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.120]   that the expected return is higher
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.600]   and then they're willing to run the risk
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.560]   that that expected return does not materialize,
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.640]   then I think that they have made a defensible choice
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   to not pay off their debt.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.200]   - David Gravener has a question.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.040]   - Okay.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.560]   - 5K, were you finished?
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.720]   - Okay, David, do you have a question?
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:57.440]   Okay, Christina, do you have a question?
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.480]   - Yes, I'm wondering, I also put it in the chat,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.440]   but I'll just go ahead and state it here.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   I'm wondering, as you move closer to retirement,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.560]   should you consider moving most of your money
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.600]   into an after-tax account
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.480]   so that you're not "surprised" by the taxes you're paying
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.960]   when you're drawing down from pre-tax accounts
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   like 401(k) or traditional IRAs?
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:30.280]   - I think the answer is in your question,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.040]   and that would be, don't be surprised.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   You might want to do Roth conversions, or you might not.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   While you're still working,
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   it's usually not beneficial to do Roth conversions
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.680]   because now your Roth conversion amount
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   is being added on top of your salary or your wage income,
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.800]   and so you're gonna pay a pretty high marginal rate, usually.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.280]   - Right, but doesn't a Roth conversion assume,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.120]   like, excuse my ignorance here,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.400]   but doesn't a Roth conversion already assume
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   that you're making a certain amount of money?
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.760]   So I'm working from the point of view
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.040]   that you're not making so much money
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   that you can do some sort of mega backdoor or Roth
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.120]   that you just basically have some basic investments
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.720]   in traditional retirement accounts,
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.480]   like a 401(k) or what have you,
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   and you're putting all your money into that,
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.360]   but perhaps as you move closer to retirement,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.200]   when you start to draw down from that 401(k),
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.800]   you're gonna be paying taxes on that,
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.440]   or you're gonna be paying taxes on your traditional IRA.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.320]   So at what point, I'm wondering,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.280]   should you be trying to move money,
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.720]   or should you, maybe it's not about moving money,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.840]   maybe it's just simply about putting money now
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.280]   into, let's say, a Roth account of some sort.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.480]   I'm just really trying to figure out,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   like, how do you avoid paying taxes you don't need to pay,
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.440]   if that makes sense.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   - And that would be that you learn enough
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.480]   to understand your own personal tax situation.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.560]   There's lots of ways to do it.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.680]   If you use, you can pay a CPA to tell you,
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:52.040]   you could use TurboTax, and you can say,
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.080]   well, okay, here's what it would be, here's my base,
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.960]   and now if I were to do $1,000 Roth conversion,
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.640]   how much more tax would I pay,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.840]   and what's that divided by 1,000,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.160]   so what's my marginal rate on that,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.520]   so forth and so on.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.320]   You can use spreadsheets
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.720]   that will do all those calculations for you
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.920]   and give you a chart that'll show you
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.560]   what your marginal rate would be for your Roth conversion.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.160]   The whole thing on Roth conversions
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.560]   or traditional versus Roth,
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   it boils down to, it's the, where is it here?
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   You really want to understand the rate
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.040]   that you're gonna pay,
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.920]   so with a Roth conversion,
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:45.840]   if it's gonna cost you 24% to do a Roth conversion now,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.680]   but you expect after you retire,
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.480]   you can take money out of your traditional account
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.760]   and only pay 15%, then wait.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:02.840]   If it's gonna cost you 12% to take your money
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.120]   and do a Roth conversion now,
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.000]   and you expect after retirement,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.640]   you're gonna have a pension kick in,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.400]   and you're gonna start Social Security,
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.000]   so you're gonna be paying 22.2%,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.960]   then don't wait, do that conversion now at 12%.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.560]   So it really, it matters what your situation is,
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.840]   what your tax rate is going to be now
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.960]   and what you think it's going to be later.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:35.000]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.840]   - Thank you.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.640]   - I'm sorry that I can't give a cut and dried answer.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.160]   What I can say, Christina, is that for me, for our family,
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.240]   we were surprised when we retired
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.560]   that we were in a higher tax bracket
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.480]   than when we were working, and we did not expect that,
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   but life has its way of changing your tax expectations.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.120]   We have pensions and also RMDs,
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   and then my husband went back to work with 401k,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   with, I'm sorry, W-2 wages.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.720]   And before you know it, we're back up in a higher tax,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.360]   we're in a higher tax bracket than when we worked.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   So there are many Bogleheads who did find that,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   I read them on the forum,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.800]   and also many Bogleheads
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.880]   are in more or less the same tax bracket,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   just more or less the same tax bracket when they retire
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.200]   as when they were working.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.720]   - Thank you, Miriam, that's very helpful
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.280]   because what you just described is what I'm talking about.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.840]   - What you're looking at.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.200]   - Exactly, so that was very helpful, thank you.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.280]   It's like, you can try to plan,
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.960]   but I mean, I'm not quite at or near retirement yet,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.280]   but you thought you were doing
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.040]   all the things you needed to do,
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.840]   and then yet you get in retirement,
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.520]   and it's like, surprise, surprise.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   So that's helpful, thank you so much.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.400]   - You're welcome.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.960]   Also, David Grabener, are you unmuted now?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.080]   - Yes, I'm unmuted.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   - Okay, you're on.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.680]   - I want to clarify the way we look
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.480]   at the paying down a debt versus investing decision.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:29.880]   So try to take an objective look at this.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.480]   So if you pay down a loan,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.280]   you're getting a risk-free return
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.320]   equal to the rate on the loan.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.640]   And so you have to decide,
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.280]   would you rather get a risk-free return
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.440]   equal to the rate on the loan
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.480]   or the rate on your investments?
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.760]   Well, if you hold a bond,
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.840]   you're getting a low risk return
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.360]   equal to the rate on the bond.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:00.680]   So that I think is a five case point
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.640]   about if you're 100% stock,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.920]   then it might well make sense
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   to hold a debt that's sufficiently above the bond rate.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.440]   You'd rather get a,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.200]   you'd rather invest in stock
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.280]   and expect 7% with a lot of risk
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.640]   than get a risk-free 3%.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.720]   But if you hold a stock,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.200]   if you hold a bond yielding 2%
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.600]   and a loan at 3%,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.080]   then if you sell the bond to pay down the loan,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.160]   you're getting a guaranteed 1% benefit
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.800]   without changing your risk.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.400]   So unless there's some other reason you wanted,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.440]   so if you have any bonds at all,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.680]   then paying, unless there's some other reason,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.520]   and there may be,
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.600]   you may need to keep the money liquid.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.040]   It's often better to,
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.520]   it's usually better to max out your 401k
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.760]   rather than paying down a mortgage
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.640]   because you get taxed for growth for the long time.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.280]   But I think that that's the point
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.480]   I tend to make on the forum,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.360]   that if you are actually 100% stock,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.400]   and you're well,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.680]   then it may make sense to borrow a lot more,
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.440]   to borrow more than at significantly above the bond rate.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.280]   But if you hold any bonds,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.640]   you can view your mortgage as a negative bond,
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:24.480]   and therefore paying down the mortgage
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.600]   is a better kind of "bond" to buy.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.480]   - That if its rate is significantly higher,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.920]   and if you can pay down,
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.960]   and if you don't get any other benefit like liquidity.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.240]   And liquidity is useful,
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   but I don't think on the forum,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.800]   I think unless you're 100% stock,
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.280]   I would certainly pay down a mortgage
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.240]   that's 3% above the treasury yield.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.680]   - Thank you, David.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.680]   - That's covered pretty well in the paying down loans
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.320]   versus investing wiki article,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.040]   which that's where it's linked here.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   - Yeah, I'm one of the main contributors to that article.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:15.840]   - That's why I made sure to bring it up.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.960]   - It does show a lot about how I think about the problem.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.240]   - Yep, I think it's well-written.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.960]   - 5K, does it depend on the type of debt?
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.600]   Like what about student loans,
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.360]   paying off student loans
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:36.240]   rather than investing for retirement?
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.920]   That is often discussed on the forum that-
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.160]   - I suppose it could.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.600]   That's getting to be a really sharp pencil there
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   to make distinctions.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.280]   Debt is debt, you can get into callable
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.880]   versus non-callable and all that sort of stuff.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.640]   But I think if we're gonna stick
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.880]   with the Boglehead principle of simplicity,
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.360]   let's just say debt is debt.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.240]   - Absolutely, and then one other thing
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.120]   I'd like to add to on the topic,
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.640]   I think often gets overlooked
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.520]   because a lot of people start comparing at different rates,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.880]   carrying debts versus investments.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.840]   It really boils down to cashflow.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.640]   If you're carrying debts,
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.120]   not only are you paying an interest rate
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.160]   on that borrowed amount of funds,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.480]   but you're also servicing that debt.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   And therefore that cashflow
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.040]   is flowing out of your expense column
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.120]   rather than staying in your asset column.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.880]   And so the more money that you're paying out
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.360]   servicing debts of say credit cards,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.280]   student loans, car payments, XYZ,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.160]   let's just call it consumer debt.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.920]   That's less money that you're contributing
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.320]   to your investment efforts
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   and therefore a smaller nest egg at retirement.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.160]   Now, obviously there's no perfect plan.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.360]   And as previously mentioned,
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.440]   there is never a rule of thumb,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   but it's worth considering that paying money out
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.720]   in terms of cashflow to service debts
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.280]   is money that you're not investing.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   And so one should seriously consider that opportunity cost.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.400]   - Thank you, Michael.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   Carol, do you have a question?
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.120]   - Yeah, there was a question in the chat a while back,
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.960]   and I know this is kind of like a whole other topic,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.400]   but the question was what assets should go in a Roth
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.960]   versus a traditional IRA versus taxable account?
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.640]   And I know that's a big question.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.280]   - I'll give the one or two sentence answer.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.000]   And again, there's a whole wiki article
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.200]   that goes into pros and cons and conflicting opinions.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   But the one or two sentence answer
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   is you put your high expected growth things in your Roth,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.720]   your low expected growth, like bonds in your traditional
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.080]   and taxable, you try to make that
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.240]   as tax efficient as possible.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.920]   So that's my quick answer,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.560]   but anyone else is certainly welcome to chime in.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.200]   - Yeah, it's also worth noting that bonds pay interest,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.000]   which are typically taxed at marginal rates.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.640]   And therefore in some of Bogle's books,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.600]   he definitely highlights and mentions
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.960]   some of the potential benefits of placing fixed income
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.960]   within Roths, which are obviously a post-tax contribution.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:34.280]   So the interest earned on those bonds within your Roth
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.760]   as it compounds over many decades is a serious advantage
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.920]   because you're not paying any taxes
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.320]   on those interest payments.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.680]   - Right, so this is John.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.480]   I'm the one that posed the question.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.760]   I struggle with the question of what to put
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.320]   in my Roth account because those are
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.880]   a finite amount of assets.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.600]   I mean, it's not as large as my taxable or my 401k.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.400]   So I'm trying to be choosy about what I put
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.840]   in my Roth account.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.360]   And so I struggle between,
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.520]   like you mentioned, higher growth stocks,
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.120]   but I also have things that pay pretty good dividends
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.440]   that I don't necessarily wanna pay taxes on,
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:17.440]   like a high yield junk bond fund or a Verizon, for instance,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.120]   that pays 4.5% dividends.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.480]   So that's just my struggle.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.040]   And I just retired, so that's my context.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.160]   - Congratulations.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:34.560]   Let's see, then there's a, right under that,
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.720]   there's a question on Mega Backdoor Roth.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Currently invest Roth sells offered.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.160]   Funds I have in 401k, taxes on games.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.200]   Oh, don't worry about being confused.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.320]   Join the crowd on that.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.360]   The whole, whether it's a regular backdoor
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.960]   or a Mega Backdoor, they can get confusing.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:59.400]   So what you would need to understand is,
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.520]   do you have a third option in your 401k?
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.160]   So you have the traditional pre-tax,
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.880]   you have the Roth that goes in after tax,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.800]   and you need to find out
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   if your employer also offers after tax non-Roth.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   That's the first step.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.600]   So does your employer,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.760]   so you can contribute up to 19.5 or if you're older,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.480]   so more to either the traditional or the Roth.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.240]   But then there's that $58,000 limit
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.840]   that's employer contributions and the 19.5
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.600]   and anything else that you kick in.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.280]   So that's where the after tax non-Roth comes in.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   That if your employer hasn't matched you 2X or whatever,
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.440]   you still have this room.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   If your employer allows you to put in after tax non-Roth,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.320]   you can do that.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.600]   And then you need to, so that's step one.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.000]   Step two is, does your employer also allow you
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.920]   to then immediately or in the relatively near future,
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.280]   allow you to take that contribution
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.320]   and roll it over into a Roth account,
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.320]   either inside the 401k or out to a Roth IRA.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.680]   So it's a two-step process
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.320]   and you need to check with your employer
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.600]   on whether both of them are allowed.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.320]   - If I could just add that quick question there.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.920]   I think someone had also asked,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.160]   in terms of the gains before the mega backdoor is completed,
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.080]   I believe you'd pay taxes on those gains, is that correct?
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.720]   - Oh yes, okay, yep.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.640]   Taxes are paid on the gains, that's correct.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   So if it's gone up by $25,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.520]   'cause you waited a month,
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.840]   you're gonna pay tax on that $25,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.000]   but I wouldn't let that hold you back.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.040]   - Okay, sounds good.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.160]   It sounds like the best way to really find out about that
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.680]   is to contact your employer and your plan.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.160]   And I think there was a question in the chat asking,
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.920]   does the sales rental property,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.760]   capital gains on that rental property
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.080]   affect the distribution from IRAs on your tax return?
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.240]   - Okay, hang on to that one.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.040]   Let me just check with Gail of North Texas.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.560]   Did that answer your question?
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.320]   (mouse clicking)
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.640]   - Yes, thank you.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.440]   - Okay, great.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.280]   Okay, sorry, Maddie.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.480]   What was the one about the capital gains?
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.680]   - Oh, sure.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.760]   The person was asking,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.840]   does a sale of a rental property capital gain
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.000]   affect the distribution from IRAs on your tax return?
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.200]   - Well, it depends.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.640]   So if you've got a capital gain,
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   if you're in one of those zones
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.280]   where your capital gains are not being completely taxed,
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.880]   or you're hitting the NIIT boundary,
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.360]   and so they're gonna be taxed a little more,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.080]   if you're in one of those,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.040]   then additional ordinary income
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.280]   gets taxed at a higher marginal rate.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.680]   Otherwise, no.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:29.720]   So that's another one of those, it depends answers.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:36.880]   And if it does make sense to everyone,
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.240]   I'm amazed because it's not something that's obvious.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.000]   - Sounds like it's a complicated answer,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.200]   but I think that that makes sense to me.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.000]   - I just mentioned in the chat
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.760]   the presentation you gave us at Chicago a few months ago,
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.480]   where you used the financial toolbox.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.880]   That was a really good thing
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.320]   to play around with some numbers
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.040]   to see the financial impact and the tax consequences
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.160]   and marginal rates, effective rates, all that.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.440]   So I put the link in the notes here in the chat.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.640]   - And if we have some time tonight, I could...
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   - 5K, I think you put yourself on mute.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.680]   - Sorry, that was me, sorry.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.400]   - Oh, okay.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:33.360]   All right, I'm not sure what got muted.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.200]   - Okay, that's fine.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   5K, would you say that our young investors should aim
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:47.120]   or it would be good to arrange their order,
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:52.840]   their investing so that when they reach retirement,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:58.760]   they pretty much have a nice pot of money in their pre-tax,
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.880]   a nice pot of money in their after-tax Roths
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.640]   and money also in their taxable account?
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:13.800]   - It really depends on what their marginal tax rate
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.200]   has been through their employment.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.840]   And it's a common question.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:25.600]   People say, well, what percentage should be in which bucket?
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.640]   And it's really not the best,
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   the percentage is a consequence, not a goal.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:38.160]   So the goal is you want to fill up your traditional account
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.840]   up to, but no higher than,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   you want to fill it up by saving,
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.440]   as you put into your traditional account,
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.920]   you're saving some certain marginal rate,
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.280]   12%, 22%, whatever.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.240]   If you're in the earned income tax credit area,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   you can be saving a high marginal rate.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.800]   If you're paying NIIT, you can be paying,
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.960]   you can be saving a higher marginal rate, et cetera.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.000]   You want to keep filling up that traditional account
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.040]   by saving at whatever marginal rate you're saving at
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.360]   until it gets large enough that you think
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.000]   that when you start to withdraw
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.960]   from that traditional account,
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.600]   you're going to be paying somewhere close
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.760]   to that same marginal rate.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.440]   So if you've got someone that's making
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.160]   relatively low income,
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   they may end up with 90% of their investments
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.040]   in traditional because they're going to be pulling it out
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.000]   at a fairly low marginal rate.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.360]   Or you take someone, you've got a brain surgeon
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.760]   who's making half a million a year or whatever,
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:01.960]   they're going to have a relatively small amount
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.200]   in traditional because they can only put so much in there.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   And they're going to have a whole bunch in taxable
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.440]   and Roth because it's spilled over.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.560]   So I can understand why people want a percentage
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.880]   because that's a nice, easy thing to look at,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.560]   but it's really the percentage should be an outcome,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.480]   not a goal.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:34.880]   - We actually have a question in chat on that.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   It says, is there such a thing as too much money
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.480]   in a Roth versus traditional IRAs?
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   In other words, if I only have Roth funds
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.440]   with no more traditional IRA funds,
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.400]   aren't I wasting some of my efficiency?
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.720]   - Yeah, if you have everything in Roth,
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.000]   and I mean everything,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.120]   so you're not paying any tax at all in retirement,
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.520]   then yeah, you missed a bet.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.720]   You should have made some traditional contribution
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.600]   and saved taxes back at that point.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.440]   - Sonia, do you have a question?
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.840]   Sonia, you're on mute.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:32.800]   - No, sorry, it's a mistake.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.640]   - Okay.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.800]   - No, I think someone else had a question in the chat.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.560]   Any thought on placing similar asset allocation funds
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   in tax and tax deferred accounts
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.160]   wouldn't be a hundred percent tax efficient,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.360]   but you'd avoid behavioral issues
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.400]   and you'd get automatic rebalancing.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.720]   And what are your thoughts about that?
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.120]   And the other advantage that they pointed out
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.400]   was you might be able to do a similar amount withdrawal
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.200]   across all accounts when you need to spend in retirement.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   - That's a trade-off between simplicity and optimization.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.480]   And both of those are somewhat subjective.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.560]   One person's simple is another person's complex
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.200]   and one person's optimum is another person's not worth it.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.760]   I can't improve on the pros and cons
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.520]   in the tax efficient investment wiki.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.640]   - Thanks, and Doug, I mean, just to follow up on that,
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.200]   curious, has anyone actually looked at like,
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.960]   what are the percent differences in, for instance,
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.200]   accounts if you did that
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.720]   versus doing something that's more tax efficient?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.360]   Like how much of a difference does that make
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.480]   at a retirement time?
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.240]   (mouse clicking)
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:02.320]   - I'll let anyone else who wants to weigh in on that one.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   - Manny, could you ask your question again?
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.520]   Was it your question or a question from the chat?
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.680]   - It is my question.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.080]   I was just more curious based off that question,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.480]   but essentially they were saying simplicity
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.520]   versus more complexity.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.320]   If you had similar asset allocation
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.800]   in tax and tax deferred accounts
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.920]   versus doing a more tax efficient asset allocation,
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.720]   what's the actual difference in retirement?
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.280]   Like what's the percent difference you might have
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.480]   in the amount you're able to withdraw in retirement?
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.360]   - Are you talking about tax efficient by putting,
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.280]   are you talking about stocks versus bonds
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   in your tax, in your pre-tax versus your Roth?
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.360]   If you were to, you know,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.280]   rather than just putting similar asset allocations
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.040]   across tax and tax deferred,
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.000]   exactly, to put them in a more tax efficient manner.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.200]   So it wouldn't be, you wouldn't be accumulating tax drag.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.040]   - Okay.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.640]   - Well, I can, I'm, even when I was working,
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.160]   my Roth account, I had mostly stocks.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.840]   And the reason was I wanted it to grow
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.920]   because it was my account I was anticipating
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.720]   to be used for health reasons.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.400]   For, since we do not have,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.360]   we don't, we have health insurance,
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.440]   but we don't have long-term care insurance.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.360]   And so I was, wanted it to be big for that
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.840]   and also to leave to the kids.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.600]   I simply wanted it to grow.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.520]   I could not get over.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.640]   It just seemed to me that it was tax free.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.400]   All the growth in my Roth IRA was tax free.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.120]   It was just going to grow and grow and grow.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.520]   And it just seemed to me,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.120]   I just could not get over how it would grow big
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.880]   if I had a lot of taxes, a lot of stocks in there
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.960]   for what I needed in the long-term future.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.200]   Is that what you're talking about?
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.520]   - Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.840]   And I was really wondering like,
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.640]   what is the actual difference in retirement?
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.480]   You know, if someone didn't do that and they put,
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.960]   you know, taxes, like equities and bonds
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.680]   in their tax protected accounts,
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.960]   like what would the actual difference be?
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.800]   But it sounds like it'd be, it's beneficial really,
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.000]   or it could be beneficial
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.080]   to leave stocks in those tax protected accounts.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.920]   - In Jack Bogle's "Guide to Investing" book,
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.680]   there's a chapter near the back of the book somewhere,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.360]   I actually have it here in my library,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   where he does a small little breakdown
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.640]   of exactly what you're asking
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.480]   and does a comparison of putting X amount of dollars
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.880]   in a taxable account
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.520]   and then taking the same amount of dollars
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   and putting it in a tax deferred or advantaged account.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.600]   Additionally, whether you select equities or bonds
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   and what the resulting investment total would be at the end
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.280]   considering tax drag that you're referencing.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.040]   So I don't know if you can get your hands on that book,
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.400]   but I think that may point you
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.920]   in the direction to what you're asking.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.600]   - You're talking tax drag from a taxable account, Michael,
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.000]   is that right?
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Not the tax drag that comes or the taxes that you pay
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.080]   when you withdraw from your traditional 401k
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.960]   or your traditional IRA, right?
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.200]   You're talking about a taxable account
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.200]   versus a traditional IRA or a traditional 401k?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.200]   - Yeah, I was just trying to reference that chapter
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.000]   in the book that may have helped the gentleman
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.200]   ask him the question,
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.800]   if it may have helped clarify his question.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.360]   It just came to mind 'cause what he was asking
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.520]   seemed to be similar to what I recall reading
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.040]   in that chapter of "Boglehead's Guide to Investing" book.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.000]   - Thank you.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.520]   5K.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.120]   - Let's see, question about IBONs
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.760]   with which I am not familiar.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.560]   So if someone would like to weigh in
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.400]   on Deepak's question on IBONs.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:53.560]   - 5K, I do have another question on teachers
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.440]   and 403(b) plans.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.920]   We do have many teachers on the Bogleheads
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.560]   and I know that they have a weird setup
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.280]   with their 403(b) plans.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.400]   How does that fit into your investing priorities?
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.320]   Should they like, you know, abandon,
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.040]   get out of them if they really could
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.880]   and move into Roths and traditional?
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.440]   They also have annuities,
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.720]   which sometimes are not the best investment for them.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.360]   - There's one, I know there's a link
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.400]   in the Money Mustache one.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.120]   I'm not sure if there's a link in the Wiki.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.720]   If there's not, I'm sure we could put it in there,
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.120]   but it goes something like, you know,
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   if you have poor choices in your 401(k)
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:48.920]   and it refers people to the Bogleheads Wiki article
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   on how do you decide how poor is too poor?
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.040]   And David Grabener could go into more details on that,
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.680]   but there's some calculations you could do.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.240]   You know, there was a recent thread
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.840]   where someone was paying, I think,
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   a total of about 0.3% in their 401(k)
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.320]   or maybe it was a 403(b)
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   and they thought that this was terrible.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:17.760]   And, you know, while it's not as good as a 0.04%
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.360]   for 401(k) or 403(b), it's by no means terrible.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.920]   You know, if you're getting up into 2% and 3%,
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.400]   you know, that can be terrible.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.920]   And especially with teachers who may stay
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.040]   with the same school district for a long time.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.680]   But yeah, that's just something that they need to look at,
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.760]   just how bad is it?
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.760]   And sometimes 90% of the funds are really terrible,
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.080]   but there's a Vanguard S&P 500 one in there
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.200]   that the salesman never tell you about,
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.480]   but if they look closely, they can see it
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.040]   or something similar.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.160]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.840]   Mega Man, are you, you have a question?
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.880]   - Yes, I wanted to circle back
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.920]   to the Roth versus traditional IRA.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.040]   And the question was, is it possible
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.400]   to have too much in the Roth?
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.680]   And I think the answer is yes.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:21.360]   If you've got 100%, you're losing tax efficiency
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.640]   at some point.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.640]   I've got about 70% in my Roth and I'm retired for 10 years.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.680]   So we're really, it's nice to have both
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.800]   because it gives me great flexibility for taxes,
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   especially when you look at the tax brackets,
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:46.280]   there's a jump from 12% to 22% tax rate.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.800]   And that's if you're making 20,000 a year up to 81,000,
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.560]   you're paying just 12% tax.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.920]   So that's a 10% spread.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   So I can use my taxable funds up to the 81,000.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:11.880]   And then if I need more, I can just take it from my Roth.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.200]   So I can, you know, 300, 400,000 for that year,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.800]   I can take out of my Roth.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.400]   So I think in those particular,
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.600]   that bracket is 8% or 10% spread.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.040]   And then the spread from 173,000,
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.560]   this is joint married couples, up to 330,000,
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.880]   that's a 24% bracket up to a 32% bracket.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   So that's an 8% spread.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.200]   So if you're in that bracket,
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.200]   you'd take your traditional up to the 173 and pay 24%,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.960]   but use Roth money that if you need more beyond that,
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.040]   because you don't wanna be in the 32% bracket.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.040]   So that's what I like is keeping the bracket
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.920]   and I know where my tax is gonna be.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.800]   And I have the flexibility because I have a lot of Roth
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.120]   and I also have traditional.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.480]   - Interesting, thank you.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.320]   - Sure.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.800]   - 5K, do you have comments on that?
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.400]   - I agree.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.640]   (laughing)
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:32.440]   Lady Geek has put the link to the expensive
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.080]   or mediocre choices and some I-bonds.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.720]   As well, so I love it when there's a good person
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.240]   filling in the answers in chat.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.600]   So thank you.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.480]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.240]   Could you go over 5K,
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   what the difference is between tax brackets
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.240]   and marginal tax rate and how young investors
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.600]   who don't wanna learn,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   who do not want to get into the weeds of taxes,
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:14.840]   but they want to just create their portfolio,
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.400]   a simple portfolio.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.440]   Do they have to worry about marginal tax rate versus bracket?
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.200]   Can they just look at their tax bracket
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.360]   and they'll be pretty safe in assessing their portfolio
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.960]   or their investments and where to put them?
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.120]   - Probably, I mean, the whole Roth versus traditional thing,
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.960]   we're just nibbling around the edges on that anyway.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.200]   If someone's gonna agonize over Roth versus traditional,
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.240]   they should just invest and flip a coin.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.360]   So the short answer is, yeah,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.480]   they can just use their tax brackets.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.160]   But you did ask about young investors.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.160]   So I'm going to make the perhaps unwarranted assumption
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.400]   that if you're talking about a young person,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.360]   they can handle a spreadsheet.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:11.960]   So let me show how easy it can be.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   So, okay, so if we're gonna do young,
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.920]   so let's say we've got a young married couple
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.080]   and they're both 35.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.760]   Can people see the spreadsheet?
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.240]   - Yes, is this your personal toolbox spreadsheet?
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.040]   - Yeah, it's the one, it's, as I've said,
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.440]   I can answer probably most questions about it.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.840]   The detailed questions go back to the Money Mustache Forum
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.200]   where it's hosted there.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.680]   But yeah, I can probably answer
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.320]   any beginner questions about it.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.800]   I find it a very useful tool.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   So, okay, so we've got married.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.440]   Oh, let's say they've got two kids.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.480]   They're both under 18.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.840]   Yeah, they're both under 13.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.360]   One of them's under six and they both qualify
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.760]   for earned income credits.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.280]   So it depends on what kind of earning.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.440]   So let's say we've got one of them
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.440]   is making, gosh, I don't know, $60,000 a year.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.360]   The other one's making $40,000 a year.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:42.960]   And they want to know if they make 401(k) contributions,
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.360]   how much is that going to save them?
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   So they are firmly in the 12% bracket.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:06.440]   So if all they knew was that they were in the 12% bracket,
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.640]   that would have been fine
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.760]   because they are so firmly within that,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   that if they both contribute the maximum to their 401(k),
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.440]   then they get down and they just reach the first tier
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.600]   of the saver's credit.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.600]   But because they had to put over $30,000 in there,
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.120]   just to reach the first tier of the saver's credit,
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.800]   it really doesn't change their marginal rate
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.160]   very much at all.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.360]   They're still at 12%.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.800]   So if you've got someone in that situation,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.720]   they say, I'm in the 12% bracket.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.880]   I'm gonna roll the dice and figure this is the lowest.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.640]   Tax rate I'm ever gonna pay.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.080]   And they go all off.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.960]   That's a defensible choice.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:01.040]   But let's change things a little bit around here.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   Let's say one of them decides I'm gonna go on.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.080]   - It's a little hard for me to see the box you're changing.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.920]   If you could just mention what you're changing
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.200]   when you just-
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.520]   - Okay, so I had it set up.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.480]   So I'm in the upper left here,
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.320]   then one of them was making 60,000.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.720]   The other was making 40,000.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.120]   Over here, they've got a couple of kids.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.720]   One of them's under six and one of them's not.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.160]   Say one of them's five, the other's 10, whatever.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.640]   And so this was their only income.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.240]   And they wanted to know what should they do
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.200]   with their 401k?
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.960]   Should they do traditional or Roth?
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.480]   Well, in that case, they're in the 12% bracket.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.080]   They are firmly in the 12% bracket.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   So I'm down here looking at the chart and it's 12%.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.240]   No matter how much they contribute to the 401k,
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.760]   except for that one little blip
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.040]   where they hit the first tier of the saver's credit,
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.600]   they're smack in the 12% bracket.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.640]   But now let's say the one that was making 60,000 says,
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.960]   well, I'm gonna go back to school for two years
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.120]   to get a better nursing degree or whatever.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.200]   So that drops out.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.560]   Well, now that changes things a bit.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.880]   Now you've got someone that, good grief,
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.480]   they're in the earned income tax credit zone now.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   So they're saving more than 50%.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.080]   I'd have to change the scale here.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   So they're actually, if they could afford it,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.240]   now this gets into, can they afford it?
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.280]   So now only one of them can possibly contribute.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.280]   But let's say maybe they received an inheritance
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:07.280]   and bemoan the fact that they got the inheritance,
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.160]   but now they got it.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   They've got this cash that they can live off
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.080]   for a couple of years
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.560]   while one of them goes back for a better degree.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.640]   Well, you might think that they're earning $40,000,
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.160]   they're in the bottom of the 12% or top of the 10% even.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.960]   But because of the earned income tax credit,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.600]   they can actually save 80%
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.760]   on at least some amount of traditional contribution.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.520]   So that they ought to do.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.600]   Here they ought to take a 12,
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.720]   they ought to take a traditional contribution
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   and maybe up to $5,000, they do all traditional.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.480]   And they're still at 20%,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.720]   which is maybe they go traditional,
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.320]   maybe they go off.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.680]   That's at 80%, they should do traditional.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.080]   And then once they get up to contributing 15,000
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.400]   while they're not paying any tax,
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.360]   they're not getting any credit,
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.560]   they should put it all in Roth.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:15.200]   So that's a quick, it depends answer to your question about
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.440]   can they just go by tax bracket
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.320]   or do they need to look at marginal rate?
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.720]   But the point of using a tool like this,
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.640]   it's just very, very fast to get a quick look
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.320]   at what the marginal rates are.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.440]   For someone who's 92 years old
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.320]   and has never used a spreadsheet,
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.800]   I wouldn't suggest this.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.360]   But someone in their 20s or 30s
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.280]   and they use spreadsheets in college,
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.800]   they ought to be able to handle something like this.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:59.240]   - I did a presentation on this spreadsheet,
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.840]   the personal financial toolbox.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:06.640]   I think it was in March for the Chicago chapter
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   and it is on the Vogelheads virtual presentation list.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:17.160]   I believe it's all there.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.360]   - And as I'm looking in the chat,
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.560]   yeah, the answer to all the questions,
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.080]   recent questions are yes.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.840]   Whether it's personal finance toolbox
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.760]   or the case study spreadsheet, it's the same thing.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.280]   - Okay.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.840]   And it is also in our wiki in the,
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.480]   I think, is it in the tax efficient fund placement wiki
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.800]   or the-
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.040]   - It's in the tools and calculators wiki.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.240]   - Tools and calculations wiki.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.560]   Okay.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.400]   - Yeah.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:57.640]   - 5K, is there a time at which a point
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.920]   at which the taxes you have paid
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.880]   to convert a traditional to a Roth
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:11.160]   are outpaced by your earnings in the Roth
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:16.000]   that are now tax free?
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.600]   What point would that be?
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.880]   How would we see that?
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.040]   - That sounds like a return on investment thing.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.760]   And I know that's a hot topic these days.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.720]   Personally, I don't get the whole return on investment
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.640]   idea of analyzing traditional versus Roth.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.600]   I mean, you have to pay tax.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.680]   You either pay it now or you pay it later
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.760]   or your heirs pay it now
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.920]   or your heirs are gonna pay it later.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.640]   Or if you leave it to a charity,
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.600]   no one's gonna pay tax.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.800]   But it's not like you're going to take a thousand dollars
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.360]   and invest it in stocks
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.880]   and hope to get your thousand plus gains back.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.920]   If you're paying tax, you're paying tax.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.720]   It's just, when are you paying it?
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.520]   And at what rate are you paying it?
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.920]   So it's all about the rate.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.680]   It's not the amount of tax you pay
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.480]   because if you go by amount of tax you pay,
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.640]   Roth is going to win every time
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:33.160]   because you pay a little bit of tax now
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.440]   and after, let's say it's grown tenfold,
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.240]   well, you're gonna pay 10 times the amount of tax later
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.920]   even if it's at the same rate,
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:46.160]   but it ends up being the same amount after tax.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.000]   So looking at the amount of tax paid
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.280]   is just not the right way to look at it.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.080]   You've got to look at the tax rates.
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.040]   And so the traditional versus Roth wiki has,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.400]   there's a common misconceptions section.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.640]   That's the second one.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.040]   The second one is the one that says,
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.080]   look at the amount of tax paid.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.480]   No, that's a misconception.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.760]   And the first one, first misconception
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.000]   is that you get to save at a marginal rate,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.720]   but you only pay at your effective rate.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.400]   No, you don't get to start from zero
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.920]   on every single withdrawal.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.280]   So, but that section of the Roth versus traditional wiki
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.120]   covers those two common misconceptions.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.560]   One favors Roth, one favors traditional,
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.920]   but neither one is correct.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.800]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.200]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.600]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.000]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.400]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.140]   (upbeat music)
