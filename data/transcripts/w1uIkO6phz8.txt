[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Today's question is one faced by a lot of pastors.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.900]   I know this because I see it frequently pop up in the inbox.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.800]   As people find Christ and are converted and are called to live differently than their
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.080]   pre-conversion passions, this raises endless questions about living arrangements.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.280]   The question originates as a follow-up from a listener named Cameron.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.560]   "Hi Pastor John, in episode 920, Divorce, Remarriage, and Honoring God, you argued that
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.440]   people should stay in a second marriage even though it was entered wrongly.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.280]   You said, 'A prohibited relationship can become a consecrated and holy one.'"
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.400]   My question is along this line.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.280]   Does this principle also hold to people in same-sex marriage relationships or in polygamous
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.560]   marriages?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.680]   After conversion, would you advise them to stay in similar relationships and somehow
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.760]   consecrate them?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.520]   What makes those two scenarios different in your mind than divorce?
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:12.640]   No, I would not recommend that two men or two women living together, practicing homosexuality,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640]   remain in that relationship.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.360]   The reasons are several.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   The situations are different between a man and a woman entering a marriage they should
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.160]   not enter, and a man and a man entering a relationship they should not enter.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.800]   Let me try to explain some of those differences, which would result in my decision not to recommend
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.880]   that they stay there.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.760]   Number one, the reason I took the position that a man and a woman in a marriage which
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.200]   they should not have entered should stay in that marriage and seek to consecrate it to
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.840]   the Lord is because the Bible, while not condoning the entrance into the marriage, nevertheless
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.400]   calls it a marriage.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.680]   Here's what it says in Luke 16, 18, "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.160]   commits adultery."
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.120]   So don't do it, in other words.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.960]   And he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.340]   But he does use the word "marry," not just sleep with.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.320]   He calls it a marriage.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.640]   And Jesus says to the woman who had been married five times in John 4, 17 to 18, "You are
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.020]   right," he says to her, "you are right in saying, 'I have no husband.'
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.140]   For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband."
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.900]   So Jesus differentiates the five from the one, even though she's living with the one.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.500]   And he says, "No, he's not your husband.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   The others were, and he's not."
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.420]   So I conclude that while it was an adulterous act to marry under the conditions that Jesus
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.740]   disapproves of in Luke 16, nevertheless it's called a marriage.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.780]   And a marriage is a matter of covenant faithfulness between a man and a woman.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.140]   And therefore I would encourage that couple to repent of what they did wrong and to ask
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:49.500]   for forgiveness and to consecrate their union, which, though it should not have happened,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.980]   may nevertheless be holy before the Lord.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:06.380]   But two men or two women entering a relationship of sexual union with promises is not a marriage.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.820]   It's not a marriage.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.460]   You can't consecrate a marriage that should not have taken place if it is not a marriage
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.620]   at all.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.460]   And the union of two men and two women is not "gay marriage."
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.020]   It's no marriage.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.860]   I don't like the idea that so many people are willing to use the term "gay marriage"
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.100]   instead of calling it "so-called gay marriage," because there is no such thing in the universe
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.060]   as so-called gay marriage.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:49.540]   Marriage, which is defined by God in this world according to His Word, is not a man
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.580]   in union with a man.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.980]   That's our imagination.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.660]   His definition goes like this.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.500]   He quotes Genesis 2:24, "A man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.900]   his woman, his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.540]   That's where Jesus went in Matthew 19, Mark 10, and it's where Paul went in Ephesians
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.540]   5 when they were seeking to give the most essential definition of marriage.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.660]   So that's the main reason one relationship can be consecrated as a holy marriage and
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.220]   the other one can't, because one is a marriage and the other is not a marriage, no matter
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.240]   how many thousands of times legislators and laws and judges and news commentators say
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   that it is.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   It isn't.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.240]   That's the first difference.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.980]   Here's the second reason I would recommend that a man and a man or a woman and a woman
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.140]   in such a relationship not try to consecrate it but move out of it.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:03.640]   The second reason why I treat a man and a woman entering the marriage they shouldn't
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.020]   differently than a man and a man entering a relationship they shouldn't is that you
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.980]   can't make honorable what God has said by nature is dishonorable.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:26.500]   In other words, homosexual behavior is not wrong just because it's commanded that we
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.940]   don't do it.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.820]   It's wrong because by nature it is dishonorable and shameful.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.540]   In other words, sexual relations between a man and a woman are not by nature dishonorable
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:47.260]   and shameful, but sexual relations between two men or two women are by nature dishonorable
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.140]   and shameful according to Romans 126 that goes like this.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.720]   For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.380]   For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature and
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.620]   the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.900]   for one another, men committing shameless.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.740]   So he's called them shameless and dishonorable.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.860]   Shameless or shameful acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:34.940]   No amount of repenting, no amount of faith, no amount of consecration can turn that which
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:43.020]   is by nature dishonorable and shameful into an act that is holy or pure or honorable.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:50.060]   That's why I would encourage two men or two women involved in such acts to renounce sin,
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.940]   repent, ask for forgiveness in the name of Jesus, and no longer make any provision for
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.260]   the flesh as Paul says in Romans 13, 14.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.220]   We did an APJ on polygamy about three months ago.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:13.420]   I think it's episode 1304, and maybe I can just refer Cameron back to that one for some
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.940]   thoughts on that issue.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.060]   It's not exactly the same issue when he raises it alongside homosexuality.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.740]   It's not the same issue because it doesn't involve sexual acts which by nature are dishonorable
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.500]   and shameful, but it is not in accord with God's original will for marriage according
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:40.180]   to Genesis 2, 24, and so it can't be consecrated in the same way that the marriage of one man
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.100]   and one woman can be.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:51.480]   So the aim would be to help those who realize this to find the most just and gracious way
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.820]   to bring a polygamous relationship to an end.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.660]   That won't be easy, and great wisdom will be needed, especially in missionary context.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.100]   Well, we continue to get a lot of pastoral questions here about living arrangements for
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.120]   those who are recently converted.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.860]   Please keep sending those questions in to us.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:20.500]   You can do so through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.020]   Well speaking of missionary context, next time we're going to close the week with a
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:29.160]   question about mission, specifically can an elect person die without ever having heard
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.780]   the gospel, or is that impossible?
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.020]   It's a good question with many practical implications flowing out of it.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.300]   We'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.020]   Thanks for listening.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.020]   [END]
