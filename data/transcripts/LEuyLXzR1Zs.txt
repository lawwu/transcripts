[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Most of you will remember that we have reached a crucial and important point in our study
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.000]   of this epistle of Paul to the Romans. We are at that point of transition from the seventeenth
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.480]   verse to the eighteenth verse. So let me remind you again of the exact context. "I am not
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.680]   ashamed of the gospel of Christ," says the apostle, "for it is the power of God unto
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.960]   salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.600]   is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The just
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:56.880]   shall live by faith.' For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:16.520]   Now, here we are, as I say, dealing with what is in many ways the most crucial part of this
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.040]   epistle, adenorite by way of introduction. We have seen that in the sixteenth and the
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.160]   seventeenth verses the apostle states the great theme of the whole epistle. And therefore,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.040]   obviously, it is very vital that we should be perfectly clear in our minds as to that.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   Many have read this epistle to the Romans and have lost their way in it, and have become
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.000]   confused and have found it an extremely difficult epistle. I feel that that is probably due
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.280]   to the fact that they have not realized as they should have done what he says in these
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   two verses, sixteen and seventeen.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.920]   Now we have been putting it like this. Let the apostle is explaining in verse sixteen
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.000]   why he is not ashamed of the gospel. He has given his reasons. And in verse seventeen
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   he partly goes on with it, but also at the same time states what is the theme of the
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.560]   gospel. Now that is what we were considering last Friday evening. I tried to give a complete
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   and a whole view of it. I felt it was important that we should give a complete statement of
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   it, even at the expense of time, in order that we might have an entire view of that
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.840]   statement. In many ways there is no more important verse in this entire epistle than this seventeenth
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.520]   verse. That is the statement of the content of the gospel as we saw last Friday evening.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   It is the announcement, the revelation of a righteousness from God, a righteousness
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.440]   from God which comes to us by faith. So it is a righteousness by faith, given to faith.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.080]   And as he tells us and as we saw, this is nothing new. This has always been God's
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.880]   method. And he takes one instance of it. Now it was stated by Habakkuk, who says in the
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.280]   second chapter of his prophecy and in the fourth verse, what is translated here in the
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   authorized version in this way, "The just shall live by faith," but which we saw can
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.680]   be much better translated by putting it like this, "The just by faith shall live." Or
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.520]   if you like, "The righteous by faith shall live." Now that is the great proclamation
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   of the gospel, and that is the theme of this epistle to the Romans. It says that God in
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   his infinite wisdom and in his infinite love and mercy and compassion has found a way to
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.200]   save the unrighteous and to make them righteous. And the way is that he gives to us and imputes
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:30.080]   to us the righteousness of his own Son, our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.400]   Now that is the heart of the gospel, that we have a righteousness from God. The righteousness
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.520]   of his own Son is given to us. And that is this wonderful and blessed good news. And
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   it is for that reason that the apostle is not only not ashamed of it, but deliberately
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.520]   uses that figure of speech, that literate is, in order to say that indeed he is very
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.440]   proud of it and is ready to preach it at Rome or anywhere else. He doesn't mind. There is
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.560]   nothing like it under the sun. Now, we mustn't stop with these particular
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   terms, but I did try to indicate in passing, in general, last week, that we must be clear
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.760]   about this word "faith," that it is something very special, that it isn't what people normally
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   and generally call faith, which we don't regard as faith at all. But that is often
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.320]   the way in which it is regarded. People say, "Oh yes, every man has got faith, and this
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.880]   simply means that he applies that natural faith to the things of God, and thereby is
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.640]   saved." We try to show that it isn't that. But there are other dangers in connection
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:54.480]   with this word "faith." There are some people who seem to regard faith as the opposite of
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:05.720]   works. Now, that in itself is also not right, because the opposite of works is not faith.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.440]   The opposite of works is the righteousness of God. That's what the apostle is contrasting.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   Men who try to save themselves by works, and this other salvation, which is the giving
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.160]   to us of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. "You can't ever become righteous by works,"
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.440]   says the apostle. "The only righteousness that avails is the righteousness that God
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.600]   gives." So you see, the opposite of works is not faith. The opposite of works is the
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   righteousness of God in Jesus Christ. And the quotations which we gave from Philippians
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:52.040]   3, 9, and so on, I think should have demonstrated that quite plainly and quite clearly. We receive
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.440]   that righteousness by faith. But that doesn't mean that faith is the opposite of works.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.560]   No, no, it's the righteousness of Christ that is the opposite of works and its righteousness.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.600]   It comes to us through faith. And then in the same way, it is important that we should
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.800]   never say that faith is the opposite of law. Now there are various statements, now and
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.320]   again, which almost seem to be saying that, as indeed there are statements which seem
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.960]   to put up faith and works as opposites. But it's very important that we should remember
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:39.800]   this, that sometimes when the apostle uses the word "faith," he doesn't only mean
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.920]   the faculty of faith, he means the whole faith position. He means the righteousness of God
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.960]   by faith. Now you'll find many illustrations of that, and the context will invariably make
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.360]   it quite plain as to which use he is giving at any particular moment. But sometimes when
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.680]   he says "faith," he's including everything, and doesn't simply mean faith as the instrument
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:14.640]   by which we receive this righteousness. Now I'm saying this in order to show that as
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   faith is not the opposite of works, it is not the opposite of law either. No, once more,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.640]   these are not antitheses, because when we receive this righteousness of God by faith,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.940]   we are fulfilling the law. The law is fulfilled for us by Christ, and that is the righteousness
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.680]   that is given to us. You see the danger of putting these things up as antitheses. It
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.720]   leads people to say that law has been done away with altogether. But it hasn't, of
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.160]   course. What Paul says is that by this way, the righteousness of the law is fulfilled
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.640]   in us. And he says at the end of chapter 3, "We do not make the law void," he says,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.300]   "but we establish the law." So we must be very careful in our interpretation and
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.360]   use of this word "faith."
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.760]   Very well, having issued those words of caution, it is perhaps important for us again to remember
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:27.220]   the content of the word "faith." Faith is a very big term. It's a term that embraces
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:35.140]   a number of ideas in it. Now, faith does not only mean a belief. It doesn't only mean
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.620]   an intellectual assent. It does mean that, but it means more than that. There is no better
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.500]   definition of course of faith than that which you will find in the eleventh chapter of the
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:54.660]   epistle to the Hebrews. And there, the three main essential qualities in faith are emphasized
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:06.260]   and stressed. First and foremost, faith does mean belief. He says there in the sixth verse,
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:12.420]   the author says, "He that cometh unto God must believe that he is, and that he is a
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:20.580]   rewarder of them that diligently seek him." Now there is emphasized the aspect of believing,
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:26.180]   the part of faith that comes to the mind. And of course it is absolutely essential.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:33.700]   Faith, he says, is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things which are
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:41.460]   not seen. In other words, you do believe them and accept them with your mind. But it doesn't
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:47.140]   stop there. And it is vital that we should remember that faith does not stop there.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.620]   What's the second element? Well, the second element in faith, according to the author
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:57.020]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, is this, that we not only see these things and believe them,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:04.020]   but that we are persuaded of them. Now that's a very important word that he uses in verse
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:12.700]   13, where he says that they not only saw these things afar off, these all died in faith,
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:19.820]   not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:27.260]   them. You see, there's another element. That means that they gripped them. Their heart
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:35.260]   was involved. Their heart and emotions became engaged. The sensibilities were involved.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.380]   And then that in turn, of course, leads to the third factor, which is this, that having
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:49.540]   been persuaded of them, they embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:58.580]   pilgrims on the earth. In other words, there are these three essential elements in faith—believing,
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:07.260]   being persuaded, and acting. In other words, the mind is involved, the heart is involved,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:13.260]   and the will is involved. Now, we've already glanced at this when we were looking at the
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.380]   fifth verse, where the apostle says, "By whom we have received grace and apostleship
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:27.540]   for obedience of faith among all nations." And you see the importance of emphasizing
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:35.140]   this tripartite character or nature of faith. Because there are many who are tempted to
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:43.340]   confuse between faith and a mere believism. There are people who are even taught to do
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.460]   that. They're evangelized in that way. People say, "Do you believe this word of God?"
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.540]   And they're told, "Yes." And they say, "Yes, I do." "Well, very well, then."
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.860]   They say, "You're saved." But merely to say that you believe the word of God doesn't
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:05.740]   prove automatically that you're saved. Are you persuaded? Have you embraced, have you
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:12.420]   made this confession in action? The obedience of faith. These men that are described in
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.260]   the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews were not simply men who said, "Yes,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   I believe in God and his promises," and who then went on living like everybody else
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.220]   in the world. Not at all. They came out of it. Look at Abram. Left his country. Didn't
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.540]   know whether he was going, but he went and was contented. Well, intense, and to suffer
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:38.300]   a great deal. Indeed, the thing emphasized in the chapter is the way these people suffered,
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:46.420]   and suffered gladly because their whole life was built upon the fact that they had believed
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:54.020]   and embraced these things that had been revealed to them. So that it's never faith until
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:02.140]   it involves action, until it's made us do something. Merely to say you believe the gospel
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.820]   doesn't mean you're saved by the gospel. It doesn't mean you're in the faith position.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:14.540]   The heart must be involved. There must be a love for these things. And above all, I
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   say, there must be evidence in the life. It must have led to action, to a movement, to
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:27.220]   a change, to a confession, not only with lips, but also with our lives.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.300]   Very well, now then, all that is here put to us clearly by the apostle in this seventeenth
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:40.820]   verse. And his quotation from Habakkuk especially brings all that out. The crisis, you see,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:46.860]   that Habakkuk was foreseeing was revealed to him by God. The Chaldeans were coming.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.420]   There was going to be terrible devastation. Is there any hope? Well, there is. That just
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:15:01.060]   by faith shall live. Now, says the apostle, that's my message. That's the thing that
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:07.420]   has been revealed in all its fullness, in all its plenitude. That's the thing that
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:17.100]   is so plain and clear now in Jesus Christ. Adam britted in the old, seen in type, seen
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:26.300]   in vision, seen indistinctly, but now manifested, made clear, revealed, unfolded.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.900]   Very well, now then, having said that, the apostle has thus brought to an end, as it
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:36.380]   were, his great statement that he's not ashamed of this gospel. And there you have
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:44.060]   his reasons for not being ashamed. Indeed, he exalts it. Because, as he says, it is only
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:52.220]   those who are righteous by faith who shall live. And now he goes on to give us positive
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:16:00.820]   proof of that. Why is he so certain that these and these alone shall live? Well, he proceeds
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:09.020]   to give us the answer, starting in verse 18. This, he says again, is something which has
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:17.480]   been revealed. And what has been revealed is that no one such as is righteous by faith
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:25.300]   shall live, because the wrath of God from heaven has also been revealed upon all ungodliness
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:32.700]   and unrighteousness of men. And now he proceeds to develop that great statement.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:41.380]   Here, in other words, we come to a new section of the epistle. And it's a section that
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:51.180]   runs from verse 18 in this first chapter to verse 20 in the third chapter. The whole argument
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:58.900]   is found in those verses. And it is, in many ways, one of the greatest and the most important
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:06.660]   sections in the whole of the Bible. It's so important that I feel constrained and compelled
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.580]   to make a number of general remarks about it before we even begin to consider it in
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:19.620]   detail. Why is it so important that we should understand the drift and the argument and
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:26.340]   the statement of this tremendous section? Well, here's the first answer. You really
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:35.700]   cannot understand the gospel without understanding this section. This is the section which shows
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:42.580]   us the absolute necessity of the gospel. The gospel, remember, is a statement to the effect
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.420]   that the only hope for man is that God has provided a way of righteousness, and that
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:53.780]   in his own Son. Well, why did God have to do that? This section gives the answer. And
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.540]   if you understand this section, you will never be in difficulties as to why it was absolutely
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.580]   vital that the Son of God should leave heaven and be born as a babe, be born under the law,
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.060]   be born of a woman, should live life as he lived it, and go to the cross and die and
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.540]   be buried and rise again. You'll never have any trouble about that. But if you're not
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:22.820]   clear about this section, well, then you'll always be in trouble about the gospel itself,
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.700]   as many people are. There are many people today who don't like the gospel of atonement.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.900]   They say, "We don't like this talk about the blood. We don't like this idea that God
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.460]   punished our sins in Christ." They reject it. And you know why? It's because they don't
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.260]   accept the biblical teaching about sin. It's because they reject the idea of the wrath
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:52.740]   of God. They reject this section. I argue that you cannot understand the gospel unless
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:59.180]   you understand this. But if you understand this, you'll not only understand the gospel,
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:05.500]   you'll embrace it immediately and thank God for it for the rest of your life. How essential,
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.740]   therefore, is this tremendous section.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:16.480]   But let me give you another reason for showing the importance of this section. There is,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:23.940]   in this section, an account such as you rarely don't find anywhere else in the whole of the
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:35.140]   Bible of the history of the human race. It is, I suppose, the most perfect summary of
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:43.500]   the whole history of men, which can be found even in the Bible. It reviews the whole story
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.580]   of men from the very creation right down until this time, and indeed until the end of time.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:56.420]   Now that's a tremendous thing. So often as Christians, as evangelical Christians perhaps
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.180]   in particular, we tend to ignore this and to forget it. We are concerned about our own
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:07.700]   personal salvation. There is nothing more important for us than for us to grasp the
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:14.780]   full view of salvation, God's great plan and purpose. And here it's set in terms of
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:21.100]   the entire history of the human race from the very beginning until this very night.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.740]   It's not only the history of the Jews, it's the history of the whole of mankind. And it
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:34.740]   passes under review in a most masterly manner, and we must understand it. It is the only
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:43.900]   adequate explanation of the human story. Now, we all ought to be concerned about that, the
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.980]   story of the human race. It's the favorite preoccupation of most intelligent people today.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.380]   There never has been, I suppose, a greater interest in history than there is at the present
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.740]   time. Professor Toynbee has published his monumental work in ten volumes, A Study of
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.140]   History he calls it. Others have been doing the same thing. You and I have lived in a
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:11.100]   century when this problem of history has obviously become crucial. People are asking, "What
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.060]   is happening to men? What's happening to the world? What is the whole meaning and purpose
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.700]   of life and of history?" Now, here I maintain is the only adequate history of the human
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:28.060]   race. Here's the secret. Professor Toynbee's got his theory. Other professors have got
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:33.540]   theirs. They don't accept his. There are all sorts and kinds of theories and ideas as to
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:41.700]   human history. Here is God's own explanation of human history given through his apostle
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.700]   Paul.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:54.420]   But, and I want to emphasize this again, all this is unusually important today. I say quite
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:03.860]   seriously and deliberately that I know of no more important section of Scripture for
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   all of us as we talk to our fellow men and women who are not Christian. Because, you
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:20.780]   see, there are these other theories. There's this theory of evolution, for instance, which
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:29.220]   the average man takes for granted. Now let me anticipate. You will find in three years'
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.660]   time that there will be great celebrations in this country, unless I'm greatly mistaken.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.740]   They will be celebrating the centenary of the first publication of Charles Darwin's
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:49.380]   book, The Origin of Species. Now what an important book that was. That one book, I suppose, has
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.900]   been more responsible for undermining people's faith and belief in the Scriptures and in
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.300]   God's way of salvation than any other single book. Well, now, it was published by Darwin
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.820]   in 1859, and there will be great attention paid to it in 1959, for certain. And the average
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.620]   man bases his whole view of life and of history and of everything else upon that theory of
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:22.380]   evolution. It is only here that you and I find final arguments against it. So how vital
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.060]   it is that we should be familiar with this case, in order that we can help people, not
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.940]   simply to argue with them, not simply to score over them, but in order to convince them and
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:38.420]   convict them of their sin and of their need of this salvation, which is alone to be found
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:44.940]   in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Or let me put it to you like this. I say this is
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:53.100]   especially important today. It is important as it is the only explanation as to why things
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.900]   are as they are. You see, if you are discussing these matters with one of these people who
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:06.260]   believes in the theory of evolution, the thing to ask him is this, if his theory is right,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:13.100]   why is the world as it is? Why have we had our two world wars? Why has this twentieth
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:18.980]   century been such a miserable and an appalling century, if his theory is right? And they
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   really cannot answer you. They have got no explanation. Here is a perfectly adequate
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:31.820]   explanation. We shall see it as we work it out together. A Christian who knows this section
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:38.260]   should not be to the slightest extent surprised that the world is as it is. Indeed, he ought
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:45.020]   to expect it to be as it is. We are told here quite plainly and clearly that when men do
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:51.460]   what they began to do about a hundred years ago, there is nothing to expect but the very
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.860]   thing that you and I are witnessing round and about us at this present time. The Christian
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:02.420]   should not be surprised at the state of the world today. He should not be disappointed.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:08.740]   He should say the world today is proving the argument of Paul in this great section of
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:16.260]   the epistle to the Romans, for that is precisely what it does. And therefore, I would say that
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:26.500]   in the third place, it is of a special value today in that it shows us and gives us the
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:36.420]   only true explanation of the final futility of what is commonly called civilization. What
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:42.660]   I mean by civilization is, of course, culture, the belief in the training of the mind and
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.580]   interest in art and music and various other things. Now, that is all right, but not when
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.140]   people put their faith in it. And the people of today put their faith in it, what they
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.500]   call civilization. And they have believed, they have believed it intensely for a hundred
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:05.700]   years, that by means of civilization and the civilizing processes, man can be uplifted
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.780]   and raised to the heavens and his life will become almost perfect. Now, we are living
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:16.820]   in an age which is proving that that does not happen, that it cannot happen. And it
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:23.220]   is only as you understand this section that you will understand why it never can happen.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:31.260]   So that you see, this great section does really hold us face to face, not only with the basic
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:38.500]   principles of our own gospel, but with a true understanding of the world as it is, and especially
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:47.300]   today, it gives us an ultimate outlook. And for all these reasons, I argue that there
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:56.100]   is no section of scripture that is more important from the standpoint of evangelism. Now, we
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.940]   are all interested in evangelism. It is the great word today. Yes, but evangelism, remember,
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:07.660]   can be true or false. It can be done in the right way or the wrong way. It is here, I
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:16.100]   suggest, and only here, that we shall be given an insight into true evangelism, what it is
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.620]   and how it is to be carried out. Very well.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:27.300]   Having thus tried to give you some conception of the greatness and the importance of this
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:35.140]   section, shall we now give you a general analysis of it? I am going to give you a bird's-eye
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:42.300]   view of it before we come back to look at it in detail. Now, Bible students, let me
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:51.460]   commend to you the wisdom of doing that always. First of all, with any verse or any portion
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:57.100]   of scripture, any paragraph or any longer portion, first of all take a bird's-eye
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.700]   view of it. See the whole first, then come back and take it bit by bit and by detail.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:11.420]   That, as I understand it, is the true way of approaching scripture and studying scripture.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.660]   Some people, of course, stop at the bird's-eye view, never come to the details, and they
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:22.940]   really never grasp the scripture. They just rush through it and are content with having
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.660]   skimmed the surface. Others, of course, come right to the details and never get from them
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:34.140]   and have lost the general view. And, as I suggested at the beginning, they end in utter
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:40.420]   confusion and they fail to see the wood because of the trees. The right method is to do the
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:47.540]   two things, the general conspectus and then the working out in detail with a final synthesis,
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:54.820]   again, of all that has emerged in the detailed analysis. In other words, I am suggesting
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:04.340]   to you that the scripture is remarkably like a symphony. The themes are stated, the themes
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:09.500]   are worked out in detail, they are all gathered up together again in a final climax.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.700]   Now, you will find that that is precisely what the apostle does in this mighty section.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:22.180]   Very well, what is the analysis? Well, let's put it to you like this. Why is Paul so proud
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:29.700]   of this gospel? Why is he so pleased with the fact that he is being called to be a herald
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:37.980]   and an announcer of this righteousness by faith and of the fact that it is only the
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:46.300]   righteous by faith who shall live? Well, I say the answer is because something else
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:54.420]   has also been revealed. And what has been revealed is this, that nobody else shall live.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:01.300]   "Oh yes, the righteous by faith shall live," says verse 17. "Yes," says verse 18, "but
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:07.740]   nobody else shall live." That is why the gospel is so vital and so important, so unique
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:14.980]   and so glorious. It is the only way. For, and you notice the connecting link? You see,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:23.060]   he takes it up. For, the wrath of God from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:32.420]   of men is revealed, has been revealed, against these people who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:39.980]   That is why he brings this statement in, you see, in verse 18. For, and you notice that
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:46.220]   he says that it is against all unrighteousness. It does not matter who is guilty of it. It
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:52.380]   does not matter whether it is a Jew or a Gentile, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Anybody
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:59.940]   who is ungodly and unrighteous is under the wrath of God. There is no difference. So that
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:07.580]   I interpret the 18th verse as a general statement. He does not start dealing with the Gentiles
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:14.380]   in verse 18. That comes in verse 19. Verse 18 is just a general statement to the effect
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:22.900]   that the wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness,
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:33.020]   wherever it may be. It does not matter who it is. But then someone may well ask, "Is
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:40.780]   that quite fair?" Someone might say, "Well, I could understand the wrath of God being
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:46.700]   revealed like this against the Jews, because after all, the Jews were a special people
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.900]   and God manifested himself to them in a very special way. He gave them the Scriptures and
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.620]   the prophets and so on. But the Gentiles, surely, are not going to be punished like
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:05.020]   that. They have never had a chance. They do not know. Is it fair? Is it right to say that
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:13.460]   the wrath of God is also on the Gentiles as well as on the Jews?" And from verse 19
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:21.700]   to the end of the chapter, Paul deals with that objection. "Oh yes," he says, "it
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:31.980]   is as true of the Gentiles as it is of the Jews. The Gentiles are without excuse as much
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:39.380]   as the Jews, because God has not left them without knowledge. He has given them the evidence
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:46.180]   that is necessary there in the creation. And it is the refusal of that that brings damnation
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:53.660]   upon them." He works it out in great detail. His point is to establish that the Gentiles
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:04.820]   are utterly inexcusable because of what God has revealed even unto them. But then he has
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.980]   got a further proof. He argues, and we will have to pay great attention to this, he says
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.460]   three times that God has given them over to unrighteousness, by which he means that God
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:23.380]   has already punished them. There is no need to ask, "Is he going to?" He has done it.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:28.300]   He has already given them over. And the giving over of the Gentiles to the terrible type
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.860]   of life they live is a proof of the fact that they are responsible and that God has held
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:40.340]   them responsible and has punished them. Very well, that brings us to the end of chapter
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:50.500]   1. But then in chapter 2 he takes up another point. Someone might come forward and say,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.740]   "Ah yes, I am very ready to agree that anybody who lives the kind of life that is depicted
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:03.140]   from verse 19 to the end of the chapter in chapter 1, I am ready to agree that such people
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:09.340]   are vile and are foul and that they deserve punishment." But they say, "Everybody isn't
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:18.020]   like that. There are some people who have got ideals and wonderful ideas of morality.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:23.180]   There are people to whom God seems to have been very kind and he has been very good to
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.420]   them. Surely they are not going to be under this wrath and under this condemnation."
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:36.220]   It doesn't matter whether they are Jews or Gentiles who speak like that. And now the
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:43.980]   apostle deals with that question in the first eighteen verses of the second chapter. And
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:53.500]   what he says is this, that finally what matters is not people's ideas but their conduct.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:35:03.980]   He says these are the questions which we have got to face. If we recognize right and wrong,
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:11.180]   the question is, are we doing wrong? "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O men, whosoever thou
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:17.660]   art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:23.540]   judgest, doest the same things." It's all very well to stand back as a philosopher and
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:28.340]   say, "Shocking, terrible." But you are guilty of the same thing, he says, so you are condemning
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   yourself. It isn't your ideas that matter. You say, "The man in the gutter, he's got
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.020]   no ideas. He lives like a beast." You say, "I'm not like that. I've got these wonderful
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.500]   ideas." But God's not interested in your ideas, says Paul. He's interested in your
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.340]   life. What are you doing about your ideas? Are you carrying them out? And then this idea
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:56.900]   that God has been good and kind to certain people. What about that? Well, this is his
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:03.100]   answer, "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering,
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:08.940]   not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" Are you saying, "I
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.100]   don't like this idea of wrath. I believe that God is good and loving and kind and forgiving."
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.900]   Very well, if you believe that, says Paul, has it led you to repentance? It's no use
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.820]   saying, "I believe God is love." What effect has it had upon you? Has it made you turn
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:32.540]   to God and live entirely to his glory and to his praise? To say these things is of no
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:38.980]   value. It doesn't help you at all. And then he works it out in still greater detail by
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:46.580]   showing quite clearly that whether we are Jews or Gentiles, whether we are under the
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:52.660]   law or outside the law, we've all got these ideas and we've all got consciences, and
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:59.660]   they condemn us, every one of us. We shall be judged not by our professions, our ideas,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:08.660]   or anything else, but by our total living and our total relationship to God. So he answers
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:16.620]   that objection. And then from verse 17 to the end of that second chapter, he takes up
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:24.060]   another question. He seems to imagine somebody saying, "But wait a minute. If what you've
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.060]   just been saying in general is all right, surely you must grant that the fact that the
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:38.260]   law of God was given to the Jews, surely that must make a difference." And not only that,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:45.460]   they said, "Surely the fact that God gave the sign of circumcision and that all Jews
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.540]   are circumcised, surely that proves that they're God's people. He can never manifest his wrath
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:58.820]   upon them. They've got the law and they've got the circumcision." Very well, from verse
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:05.460]   17 to the end of that second chapter, the apostle proves beyond any doubt or any reply
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:12.580]   whatsoever that the mere possession of the law doesn't save you, and the mere fact
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.180]   that you're circumcised doesn't save you. It is circumcision not in the flesh but of
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:22.740]   the heart that matters. He is not a Jew which is one outwardly. He is a Jew which is one
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:30.420]   inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart. So again he's answered that objection. The
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:39.020]   wrath of God is upon the Gentiles. It is also upon the Jews. Oh, very well, says someone.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.180]   At the beginning of chapter 3, at the end of chapter 2, if you like, Paul imagines someone
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.740]   saying, "Well, of course, if that's the case, there's no point in being a Jew. What
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:54.340]   advantage then hath the Jew? What profit is there in circumcision?" Are you denying
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:00.140]   the whole of the Old Testament history, someone asks Paul? Are you saying that all that God
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:06.220]   had done to Israel was really a waste of time and had no meaning? Then Paul answers that
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:14.700]   in the first eight verses of that chapter, and he shows what advantages the Jews had,
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:20.820]   and what an advantage it was to be a Jew, because you have this glorious revelation
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.620]   of God directly. It isn't enough to save, yes, but it's a very wonderful thing to
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:32.940]   have. That can be applied in this way. The fact that a child is born, the child of Christian
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.980]   parents doesn't save it, no, but it's a very much better thing to be born a child
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.220]   of Christian parents than to be born a child of non-Christian parents. It doesn't mean
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:48.300]   that their child is more saved than the other, no, but it has tremendous advantages. The
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.340]   advantages won't save it of necessity, but that doesn't mean that they're not advantages.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:40:00.300]   Now that's what he argues in those first verses there of that third chapter. And then,
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   having done that, from the ninth verse to the twentieth, he just takes up these very
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:19.500]   scriptures, and he shows very plainly and clearly that these very scriptures show how
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:30.540]   both Jew and Gentile are unjust and unrighteous before God. The very law of which the Jew
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:36.220]   boasted was the very thing that condemned him, and he leads it up to this tremendous
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:43.900]   statement there in this nineteenth verse. "Now we know that what things soever the
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:52.340]   law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that every mouth shall be stopped,
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:41:03.140]   and all the world become guilty before God." So you see, he's arrived back at the point
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:09.980]   at which he began. He starts by saying, "The wrath of God is revealed from him upon all
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:16.180]   unrighteousness and godliness and unrighteousness of men." And here he winds it up by saying
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:27.900]   that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Jew and
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:34.780]   Gentile. The law doesn't save the Jew, for by the deeds of the law there shall be no
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:42.140]   flesh justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin and not salvation
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.700]   from sin.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:54.540]   Now then, there is this tremendous section which we are going to study together in outline.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:02.660]   You see how tremendous it is, how it spans the whole of time, takes within its ambit
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:14.260]   the whole story of men, deals with Jew and Gentile, the whole world, and establishes
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:21.140]   that the greatest and the best good news that has ever come into the world of men is the
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:32.820]   news that the just by faith shall live, because no one else shall live, because all others
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.140]   are under the wrath of God and are guilty before him.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:46.420]   Oh, it's not difficult when you look at it like this to see why Paul said, "I am not
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:55.980]   ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Emperors and kings and consuls and proconsuls, parliaments,
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:05.820]   senators, military men and captains, the whole world is guilty before God." He has the
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:15.100]   only message that can save anybody. It's the message about the righteousness that God
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:30.900]   himself provides in Jesus Christ and which is offered to Jew and to Gentile alike. Amen.
