[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.180]   My name is Josh Ruchite. I'm your host.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.980]   Today, we continue our series on
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.180]   how to invest in your children's minds.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.460]   And I did not intend this series to be as long as it is,
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.660]   but we're in the thick of it,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.160]   and I know I've got great feedback
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   from many of you that has been very useful.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.660]   I think that's very practical,
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.160]   and I'm going to continue and see this through.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.360]   In short, today, I want to share with you
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.460]   why I believe that it's important
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.060]   that you encourage and require your children
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.860]   to memorize as a way of strengthening their minds.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.660]   And there are two components to this episode.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.860]   First, I want to make a short apologetic
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.560]   for why it's important that your children memorize things,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   even in a day of omnipresent access to information
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.960]   through digitally and Internet-connected devices.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.560]   And then part two is I want to share with you
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.060]   why I think it's important that your children take training
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.160]   in how to actually memorize things more effectively.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.460]   Why memorize? That's the first question.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.060]   I think all of us are aware of the fact
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.560]   that it's easier and easier for us
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   to externalize our brain and to have access to information.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.760]   In a world in which we can ask Google or Siri
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   or whoever the next iteration of an electronic voice is
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.260]   for any specific fact or piece of information
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.460]   that we need to know,
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.860]   it seems less and less relevant and important
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.760]   for us to drill meaningless lists of facts into our heads.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.260]   We are all connected to devices that can help us
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.960]   to recall any piece of information we want to recall.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   And I think it's important to use those systems.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.060]   I think if you could go back a couple hundred years
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.860]   and introduce something like Evernote to an author,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.660]   he would have immediately seen the potential
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.960]   of the ability to build a second brain,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.760]   to build an external repository of notes
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.860]   and thoughts and comments, et cetera.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.260]   So I'm not here arguing against using the tools of the day.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.660]   I'm as grateful as you are
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.760]   for the ever-present access to a search engine,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   the information of the web, et cetera.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   We're living in an incredible age.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.060]   But with every benefit,
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.760]   there's often a counteracting drawback.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   And one of the drawbacks of our using these tools
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.360]   more and more is quite simply
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.660]   that we are exercising our brains a little bit less.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.260]   I am personally persuaded, though I cannot prove it,
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.060]   this is my opinion, and I'm not a neuroscientist,
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.360]   but I am convinced that the brain is best viewed
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.260]   as a muscle, and with more use,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.460]   the brain becomes stronger.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.960]   With less use, the brain becomes weaker.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.360]   And so we should be seeking to exercise
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.860]   the muscle of our brain as much as we can,
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.860]   as much as we are capable of.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.860]   And in fact, if you think about many of the shows
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.060]   that I have done in this series,
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.760]   talking about how to help our children to be smarter,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.360]   a lot of it simply involves exercising the brain
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.760]   in different ways.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.660]   I first became aware of this a number of years ago
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.160]   when I was interacting with a neighbor of ours.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   And this neighbor was an elderly man.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.160]   He had been very kind to me when I was young.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   I'd hung out with him a lot when I was a young boy.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.060]   And he was getting older,
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.260]   and he was starting to show signs of dementia.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.360]   But he would come down to our house,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.560]   come down the road to our house, stay at my house
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.260]   where my grandparents were, be a friend,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.760]   and just basically be a companion.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.060]   He was always in, he was there every day.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.360]   He was the guy who was checking up on the neighborhood.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   As he got older, he started to experience
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.160]   certain signs of dementia.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   And along the way, one of the things
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.660]   that he got interested in was doing jigsaw puzzles
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.660]   as well as doing crossword puzzles.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.360]   And one of the things that his wife,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.160]   who was a lot younger than he was, noticed
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.460]   was that as soon as he started engaging
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.960]   in that mental effort of doing crossword puzzles
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.260]   and jigsaw puzzles, his dementia symptoms subsided
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.160]   and stabilized a good bit.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.660]   He had several more years of a properly functioning brain
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.860]   than he otherwise would have had
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.660]   because he was exercising his brain.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.860]   And it really stuck with me as a young boy.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.260]   There was no study on this.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.660]   There was no evidence.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.260]   There was no good academic research.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.960]   This was just an anecdote from a neighbor.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.060]   But it seemed obvious to me that this is probably true.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.860]   And while I haven't always done what I aspired to
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.360]   of strengthening my own brain, I've noticed
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.460]   that if we want our brains to work well,
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.160]   they need to be exercised.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.660]   And that exercise comes in different ways.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.660]   At its core, one of the fundamental forms
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.060]   of exercise is simply memory.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.860]   Now, I've dabbled around here and there
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.160]   with some of the commentary
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.360]   that various neuroscientists talk
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.860]   about how memories are stored,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.160]   how they're lodged in the brain, et cetera.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   I couldn't present an effective teaching
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.960]   on that at the moment.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.460]   But I am convinced that the more we exercise our memory,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.860]   the more effective our memory becomes.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.460]   And at its core, this is the fundamental reason
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.160]   why we should not neglect memorization
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.360]   in the training of our children.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.460]   Rather, we should emphasize
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.360]   that they have some ongoing,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.660]   consistent requirement to memorize.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.760]   Let me read a few from a few articles.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.060]   Let me begin with a New Yorker article
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.360]   published almost a decade ago
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   called "Why We Should Memorize" by Brad Lighthouser.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   "Much of our daily lives would be dizzyingly unrecognizable
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   to people living a hundred years ago.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.260]   What we wear and what we eat,
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.960]   how we travel, how we communicate,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.260]   how we while away our leisure time.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.360]   But surely, our occasional attempts
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.160]   to memorize a poem would feel familiar to them,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.460]   those inhabitants of a heyday of verse memorization.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.960]   Little has changed.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.060]   They too, in committing a poem to memory,
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.360]   underwent a predictable gamut of frustrations.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.860]   The pursuit of stubbornly elusive phrases,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.360]   the inner hammering of rote repetition,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.960]   tantalizing tip of the tongue stammerings,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.460]   confident forward marches
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.860]   that finish in an abrupt amnesiac's cul-de-sac.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.860]   Actually, if the process has altered over the years,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.560]   perhaps we feel the difficulties of the task
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.960]   more acutely than our ancestors did.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.160]   As a college professor of writing and literature,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.760]   I regularly impose memorization assignments,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.660]   and I'm struck by how burdensome
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.660]   my students typically find them.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.960]   Give them a full week to memorize any Shakespeare sonnet,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.460]   "Hey," I tell them, "pick a really famous one.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.760]   "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   And you've already got the first line down,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.160]   and a number of them will painfully falter.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.560]   They're not used to memorizing much of anything.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.960]   In what would have been my prime recitation years,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.060]   had I been born in an earlier era,
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.560]   junior high and high school,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.860]   little memorization was required of me.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.460]   But in early boyhood, I did a fair amount of it.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.460]   My mother, who had literary ambitions,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.260]   paid me a penny a line to memorize poems.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.760]   The first one I mastered was Tennyson's "The Eagle."
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.860]   He clasps the crag with crooked hands,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.960]   which brought in a haul of six cents.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.560]   Opportunistically, I moved on to the longer "Casey at the Bat."
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville Nine that day.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.260]   And Byron's "The Destruction of the Sennacherib,"
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260]   whose title I mispronounced for decades,
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.060]   which netted me 52 cents and 24 cents, respectively.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   Some Longfellow, some Frost.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.460]   I straggled through Coleridge's "Kubla Khan"
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.060]   and enough of his "The Ancient Mariner"
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.960]   to purchase a couple of candy bars.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.160]   It sounds whimsical and entertaining now,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.260]   but I suspect some dead serious counsel
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.960]   lay behind my mother's beaming encouragement.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   I think she was tacitly saying,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   "Stick with poetry. That's where the money is."
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.460]   It turned out to be level-headed advice.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.760]   Today, I pay my bills by talking to my students about poetry
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.260]   and about stories and novels and essays,
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.460]   ultimately about memorable cadences,
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.160]   about the music that occasionally lifts off of words
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.760]   carefully deployed on a page.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   The piece goes on by the author wherein he talks about why
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.260]   and the value of memorizing, especially poetry.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.960]   And his basic argument is simply two points,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.660]   that poems that you have memorized
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.560]   are a form of larder or pantry,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.660]   something that's laid up against the hungers
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.760]   of an extended period of solitude.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.060]   You have access to these words.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.260]   And that when you really want to have access to something
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.360]   at any moment, it needs to be in your memory.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.560]   In addition, he emphasizes that
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.960]   when you know something by memory,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.160]   by rote knowledge,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.360]   you have the chance to know it on a very different level
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.160]   than if you don't know it by rote knowledge.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.360]   It's a much deeper form of knowledge.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.860]   Let me go now to an essay from the website Psychology Today
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.860]   called "Memorization is Not a Dirty Word" by William R. Clem.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.160]   And in this essay, he talks about
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.360]   the value of memorization.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   I'm going to pick it up a few paragraphs in.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.960]   In my experience with students,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.360]   both the college students I teach
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.860]   and the secondary students that teachers tell me about,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.360]   the biggest weakness students have
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.160]   is that they either try to remember school material
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.960]   by rote memorization,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.660]   or have no strategy at all,
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.760]   relying on some kind of magical mental osmosis.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.460]   Even among students who rely on rote memory,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.360]   they generally lack much of a strategy for memorizing,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   relying on various degrees of casual
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.060]   looking over the instructional material
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.260]   until they think they can remember it.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260]   Experiments show that students routinely overestimate
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.660]   how much they remember
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.460]   and underestimate the value of further study.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.560]   Moreover, many educators at all levels
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.160]   have disdain for memorization,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.760]   stating that we should focus education
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.060]   on teaching students to think and solve problems,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.060]   as if you can think and solve problems
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.760]   without knowing anything.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.660]   Too many teachers regard memorizing as old-fashioned
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.860]   and even destructive of enlightenment.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.160]   Disdain for memorization
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   is a relatively new phenomenon in education.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.160]   In ancient times, people took great pains and pride
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.260]   in memorizing huge quantities of information.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.560]   The advent of printing greatly reduced the need
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.960]   to memorize history and cultural mores.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.260]   In modern times, we have the internet,
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.460]   where you can just Google what you need to know.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.060]   So who needs to get brain strain trying to remember things?
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.860]   Now we have a book by Samuel Arbusman,
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.360]   "The Half-Life of Facts,
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.860]   Why Everything We Know Has an Expiration Date",
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.160]   where he argues that there are no lasting facts.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.760]   They all have a half-life,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.460]   that is, the number of years it takes
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.260]   to falsify half of what you think are facts.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.860]   He argues that new "facts" are made all the time,
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.160]   often replacing what we had previously thought were facts.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.360]   He argues we should just stop memorizing
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.260]   and look up whatever current facts we need on the internet.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   But if there are no lasting facts,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.760]   how are those you find on Google any more valid
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.360]   than those you memorize and can deploy in real time?
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.760]   There are some serious errors in Arbusman's position.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.960]   One, many facts are immutable.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   They don't have a half-life.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.760]   Events in history did actually occur.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.360]   And while revisionist writers of school history textbooks
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.660]   may change the reporting of those events,
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.760]   the facts remain true.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.560]   Nixon covered up Watergate.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.860]   Obama obfuscated Benghazi.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.260]   The fact of DNA as a basis for heredity is not likely to change.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.660]   Two, many facts that do change
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.860]   will not change in a given person's lifetime
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.660]   and thus will be useful in daily living.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.660]   Three, the internet is flooded with error,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.260]   propaganda, and unvetted assertions.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.960]   Four, you don't always have internet access.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.260]   Five, in many situations it is not practical
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.760]   to look up what you need.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   Ever try to read or speak a foreign language
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   where you have to look up most of the words?
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.460]   Ever try to use computer software
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.660]   where you have to repeatedly refer to the instruction manual?
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.160]   Six, expertise in any field of endeavor
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.960]   requires a great deal of memorized facts.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.560]   And if you want to succeed in life,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.460]   it pays to be an expert.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.960]   I can easily make a strong case for memorization,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.660]   especially for schools.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.960]   Here is a list supporting the importance of memorizing.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.060]   One, memorized information is always with you,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.460]   even when you lack the time or access to sources
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.960]   where you could look it up.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.460]   Two, we think and solve problems
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.260]   with what is in working memory,
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.860]   which in turn is memory of currently available information
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.160]   or recall of previously memorized information.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.360]   The process of thinking is like streaming video on the internet.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.660]   Information flows in as short frames
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.460]   onto the virtual scratch pad of working memory,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.260]   successively replaced by new chunks of information
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260]   from real time or recalled memory.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.460]   Numerous studies show that the amount of information
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.560]   you can hold in working memory
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.660]   is tightly correlated with IQ and problem solving ability.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.960]   Three, memorization provides exercise for the mind.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.260]   This is the reason schools used to require students
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.560]   to memorize poems, Bible verses, famous speeches, etc.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   The true advantage of such exercise
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.960]   is that it generates mental industriousness.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.160]   Any teacher will tell you
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.860]   that many students today are mentally lazy.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.860]   Memorization also trains the mind to pay attention
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.860]   and focus intensely.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.260]   Such skills seems to be lacking in many youngsters,
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.060]   which is most obvious in the growing number
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.760]   of kids diagnosed with ADHD.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.860]   Next, memorization trains the brain to develop learning
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.060]   and memory schemas that facilitate future learning.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.560]   Learning schemas develop as you acquire competence in an area.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.460]   Call it skill A.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.160]   Now when you need to learn a new and related skill B,
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.660]   your mind says to itself,
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.060]   "I don't know how to do B, but I do know how to do A."
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.560]   And some of that can be applied to learning B.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.860]   Memory schemas are memorized frames of reference
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.760]   and association, where having memorized fact A,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.660]   you have an association handle for memorizing fact B.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.960]   Next, if you learn strategies for memorization,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.660]   as opposed to the rote memory approach
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.760]   of looking information over repeatedly,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.560]   you accelerate the ease, speed,
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   and reliability of learning new things.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.060]   The bottom line is the more you know,
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.360]   the more you can know.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.560]   Regardless of where you stand on the importance of memory,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.460]   most people believe that learning is a good thing.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.760]   But what good is learning if you don't remember it?
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.860]   So there's a couple of overviews from articles
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.960]   talking about the importance of memory.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.560]   I would simply point out that memory
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   is a form of brain training.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.460]   Thus, it is useful in and of itself.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.560]   It's not that it's necessary for things.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   It is useful as an exercise.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.960]   This is the same thing I tell my children about math.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.160]   I think math teachers often commit a great error
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.460]   in trying to talk to people about the usefulness of math.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.160]   Clearly, math is useful.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.960]   But the fundamental reason we learn math
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   is to make us smarter, to build our brains.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.060]   It's not because we're going to necessarily be using
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.960]   our algebraic equations the rest of our life.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.760]   It's to make us smarter and to train our brains.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.360]   And when we help students and children to memorize things,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.560]   their ability to memorize things grows.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   I have an interest in great feats of memory.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.160]   I've listened to talks by people who have memorized
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.360]   the New Testament or who've memorized the Koran
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.760]   or other long works.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.560]   And one of the things that is very obvious
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.460]   is quite simply the more somebody memorizes,
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.760]   the better they become at the skill of memorizing.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.660]   That which you practice is a skill that grows.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.660]   And so it becomes much easier for them to memorize.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.860]   And this is one reason I believe we should train children
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.560]   to learn to memorize things when they are young.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   As they figure out how to memorize things,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.560]   they will become more effective at memorizing things.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.860]   In a recent episode, not part of this series,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.760]   I talked about how to go to college fast and cheap.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.360]   And one of the things I pointed out is that
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.760]   for people who are academically skilled,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.660]   you can go to college and you get a degree
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660]   really quickly and really easily.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.960]   But where does academic skill come from?
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.460]   I don't think it's something that you're born with
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.860]   or not born with.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.760]   I think there's clearly a component where we all begin
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.060]   with a baseline ability, just like we all began
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.060]   with a certain built-in athletic ability,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.860]   a certain built-in genetic size potential.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.760]   But I'm convinced we can maximize that ability
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.560]   to the highest degree possible.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.860]   And if you give me somebody who is born
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.460]   with a lower IQ than another person,
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.060]   but yet that person has years of training
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.760]   and simply practice in developing his skill set,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.560]   he has hundreds of poems committed to memory,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.060]   he has hundreds of Bible verses committed to memory,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.560]   he has dozens of historical speeches committed to memory,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.460]   he's going to have a much greater capacity
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.160]   for memorizing things.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.060]   So then when we come to academic subjects
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.960]   where memorization is necessary as a basic skill set
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.860]   of passing an exam, he's going to be able to do it
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.660]   much more easily than the guy who's never had
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.760]   any practice memorizing things.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.460]   That leads me then to point number two.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.960]   It is important for us to teach children
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.460]   how to memorize things more effectively.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   I was in high school when I stumbled across a copy
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.660]   of Harry Lorraine's book called "The Memory Book,"
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.260]   the classic guide to improving your memory
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.160]   at work, at school, and at play.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.260]   And Harry Lorraine was one of these incredible performers
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.660]   showing off his amazing feats of memory.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.760]   And he was really good, and I picked the book up,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.860]   and I was amazed at what it contained
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.660]   in terms of one man's potential,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.160]   his ability to show off his memory ability.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.760]   And I was also amazed at how useful
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.360]   some of his techniques were.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.760]   And so I went through his memory book,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   and while I'm no memory expert,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.160]   I haven't practiced all the techniques enough
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.460]   to be good with them, I am able to use
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.560]   the memory techniques that are necessary
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.160]   in order to commit information to mind when necessary.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.360]   Probably the best popular access to this would be,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.660]   if you remember in the Sherlock Holmes series
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.360]   with the British guy Cumberbatch,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.260]   there was a whole episode devoted to the memory palace
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.960]   and the idea of having a memory palace,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.460]   a place to which you put things, and that's one technique.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.860]   And there are a number of other techniques that can be used.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.860]   Basically, you can create the ability to memorize
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.960]   any bit of information that you want to memorize.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.560]   And another place that this stood out to me,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.760]   in my ninth grade geography class,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.160]   we had a teacher who taught us mnemonics
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.960]   for memorizing the capitals
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.260]   of various countries around the world.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.660]   And while I have forgotten many of the mnemonic devices
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.960]   through lack of constant use,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.260]   what I learned from that, which was most important,
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.860]   was how to create my own mnemonic devices.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.660]   And that simple skill set is something
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.060]   that can be incredibly valuable to a student
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.460]   who is seeking to put information away.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.560]   And so back to the theme of this podcast series,
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.960]   I want you to invest in your children when they are young
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.060]   so that they will be able to go farther
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.160]   than just waiting around to pay money for college tuition.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.760]   And I'm convinced that having your children
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   memorize things consistently
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.760]   is something that will enhance their capabilities
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.660]   to memorize information,
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.960]   which is something that will be fundamentally useful to them
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   in passing various academic subjects
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.360]   and doing well on quizzes, exams, tests, et cetera,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.860]   to get great grades.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.360]   And if they get great grades,
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.260]   then they can get paid to go to school,
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.260]   get paid to go to college,
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.860]   get paid to go to master's, to get a master's degree,
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.060]   get paid to get a PhD,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.160]   get paid to have a fellowship somewhere
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.260]   because of their skill of memorizing information.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.060]   And so it sounds deceptively simple.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.360]   Require your children to memorize things.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.060]   And yet it is a fundamentally valuable skill
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   with a massive payoff
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.260]   because as you require your young children
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.960]   to memorize things,
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.060]   then you enhance their ability
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.260]   to memorize things in the long run.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.960]   And that enhanced ability then gets translated
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.560]   into higher levels of academic ability.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.160]   It doesn't cost you any money
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.660]   to require your children to memorize things.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.160]   It simply costs you time and attention.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.260]   It is something that you can do that is fun.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.560]   You can do it together.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.660]   And so where I mainly use this
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.060]   is simply at the breakfast table.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.460]   We memorize different things.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.760]   We memorize Bible verses.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.560]   We memorize poems.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.960]   We memorize catechism questions.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   And it just becomes something interesting that we do.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.160]   And it's something that we all do together.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.760]   And I'm not too worried about matching any specific number.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.360]   That's not like you have to have a certain number
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.960]   of lines of poetry memorized.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.860]   What matters is that you consistently exercise the skill
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.260]   from a young age.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.460]   And of course there are many other bits of information
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.960]   that are important to memorize.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.860]   It's important to memorize your math facts.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.260]   It's important to memorize many of the basic facts
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.960]   of academic skill.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.760]   And this will pay off in spades.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.660]   And then when appropriate,
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.060]   I'm not sure the exact age
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.660]   at which this transition should happen,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.960]   but when appropriate,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.260]   you should require your students
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.060]   to memorize things on their own
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.760]   and you should teach them the memory techniques
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.260]   that the memory masters use to memorize information.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.160]   These techniques are best viewed as a bridge.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.660]   A bridge to help you recall something
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.160]   a sufficient number of times
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.860]   until it becomes part of your long-term memory
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.460]   and the bridge is no longer necessary.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.960]   I don't need a mnemonic to know
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.760]   that Belgrade is the capital of Serbia.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.260]   I'd simply know it.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.060]   But there was a day and age,
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.960]   there was a day and time
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.660]   in which I'd never heard the name Belgrade
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.260]   and I needed the mnemonic
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.760]   to actually connect the two together.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.960]   And so you're doing the same thing.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.560]   You teach techniques
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.060]   and teach your children
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.960]   all the memory techniques that are available
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.060]   and have them practice it
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.760]   with various bits of information
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.460]   so that if and when they need to use those techniques,
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.260]   they are equipped with the basic skills.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.360]   Grab yourself a memory book.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.260]   I'm not an expert in that space.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.560]   There are a few YouTube channels that I check out
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.160]   and that I watch
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.260]   because I'm interested in the subject.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.160]   There are some, I have several books
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.760]   that I've read on it,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.860]   but I don't have a specific recommendation
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.960]   at the moment for the book that you should use.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   But these are the two things.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   Number one, require your children to memorize
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.060]   so that their brains become more skilled
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.760]   at memorizing information
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   because that's a skill they can employ
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.260]   later in their academics
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.360]   when they need to memorize large quantities of information
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.960]   and teach them at a middle age
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   the specific techniques of memory
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.660]   and have them practice those techniques
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.760]   repetitively until they become very skilled
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.160]   at employing them.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.260]   That's it for today's podcast.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.160]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.060]   I'll be back with you soon.
