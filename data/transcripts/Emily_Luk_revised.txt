[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast and in this episode I have
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   a special guest with me, Emily Luck, co-founder and CEO of Plenty, a wealth platform for modern
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.560]   couples.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.900]   She previously worked at Stripe and Even, which was acquired eventually by Walmart.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.900]   Welcome to the show, Emily.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720]   Thank you so much for having me, Sam.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.140]   So in this episode, I'd love to talk about modern couples.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.260]   What is the definition of a modern couple today and what are the challenges modern couples
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.260]   face?
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260]   Great question there.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.020]   So a lot of how we think about modern couples is really looking at the partnership structures
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.260]   that people in their 20s and 30s or 40s are now in.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.220]   And right now what we see is that one of the biggest things as defining modern couples
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.020]   is that unlike older generations, 80% of couples both work.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.900]   And so there's this built-in independence that is just a natural part of the relationship.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.140]   And so that's one of the things we think a lot about when we define modern couples.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.780]   So in terms of modern couples, 80% work.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.100]   Do you remember what it was like, I guess, pre-70s, 1970s, 1980s, where was that inflection
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100]   point?
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.500]   Yeah, it was actually below 50% and oftentimes also from a career perspective and from an
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.900]   income perspective, if both partners worked, there used to be a much bigger disparity between
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.260]   the incomes that it was really more of like a part-time role or a role that had fewer
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.180]   hours in order to support the partner.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.180]   I think both because people are more and more educated as well as people are also thinking
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.820]   more about cost of living being increasing, what they'd like to do with their families
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.180]   also requiring more, there's now more of a pressure need as well as more of a desire
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.100]   to build your own career and maintain that while also having a family.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   Right.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.380]   So I guess, as I think about it as a father, I would love for my son to work and my daughter
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.380]   to work and to have dual income, but at the same time, there definitely are challenges
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.940]   in place, especially if you want to have family.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.700]   So what are some of the biggest problems modern couples face today that were different from
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.700]   in the past?
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.140]   Yeah, well, I think actually this is something that we are seeing everywhere internationally
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.620]   right now, both within the US but also in other countries where one of the things that
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.900]   also marks this generation of modern couples is that very often they're moving away from
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900]   home.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.660]   And when they're moving further away from home, they really lose that community of family
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.460]   support and that is cited to be one of the most common reasons why also there is this
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.340]   decreasing birth rate because when you don't have as much support, many couples are now
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.420]   deciding to just have fewer kids to make it work, especially when daycare expenses are
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.900]   so high.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.020]   They might need to both juggle trying to have their own busy careers while also trying to
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.540]   figure out a way that they are able to be present.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.100]   And oftentimes the decision is just we'll have one fewer or two fewer.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.860]   Yeah, it's interesting about moving away.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.180]   One of the things I was thinking about was, you know, there's like a statistic that says
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.340]   that 80% to 90% of the time you spend with your child is over by the time they turn 18
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.340]   or 19.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.200]   And so one of my thoughts was, well, why don't I just move closer to where my children are?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.740]   What are your thoughts about that strategy and why don't you think more parents – why
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740]   don't they move closer?
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.040]   So, sure, like parents, they're set in their ways but after they retire, they have more
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.620]   freedom and they can follow along and go where their children are.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.500]   I mean, does that sound a little crazy or does that sound kind of logical if you want
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   to spend more time with your children?
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.020]   It doesn't sound crazy to me at all.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.540]   And I actually think that will be a really big trend that will only increase over the
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.260]   course of the next decade, especially as we look at the baby boomer generation and they're
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.340]   moving more solidly into retirement.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.660]   They also have the financial access in terms of being able to have the ability to move
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.100]   to different places.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.140]   So I actually think that's going to be increasingly common over the course of the next 10 plus
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.140]   years.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.820]   I think though there is some reality where if you built your life in the city, you have
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.300]   your friend group, you have your community, it can also be really difficult to uproot
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.340]   and move especially if it's to a new city where you don't know as many people, you
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.100]   don't have as much community and to do that in a way that's also healthy for your kids
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.500]   where there isn't a deep reliance there.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.900]   I'm just thinking to myself, I know it'd be hard to move in the future but I mean,
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.580]   I think it's also fun to meet new people and watch them grow up and then just have
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.580]   no regrets.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.420]   So yeah, the challenges of childcare I guess for modern couples is a big one.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.760]   What about the challenges of a dual career track where sometimes I see one spouse or
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.460]   one partner really rising up the ranks and then the other one might get maybe jealous
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.900]   of that success and maybe that's more of a male thing that I've seen, I've read
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.100]   where a man might feel intimidated or threatened by their partner who happens to be a woman
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.620]   climbing up the corporate career ladder or business ladder.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.780]   What are your thoughts about that dynamic?
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.940]   So there was actually a great report that came out recently talking about also what
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.900]   happens in different partnerships where one individual is a higher earner and what are
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.100]   some of the dynamics that actually play out in terms of the amount of household chores
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.860]   that each person does.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.580]   So that was a fascinating study but I think one of the things that is almost just at the
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.940]   core of any healthy relationship is – and the way we see it and Channing and I talk
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.580]   about this too – is at the core of one person being able to do what they do, oftentimes
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.540]   that's as a result of the support of the partner.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.320]   I think a lot of times it can be a very healthy practice and gratitude to your partner and
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   also reinforcing.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   It's like, "Hey, I'm able to do this because of the support that you're able
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.700]   to give and so this is us winning, this is us really achieving together and it's not
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.940]   really as much of like you're off on your own and you did this completely independently
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.500]   and it wasn't like you had a whole family of support behind you as well."
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.180]   I actually think that's a lot of ways like relationship best practice.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180]   But I do think about it.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.300]   So if you have two highly motivated individuals trying to grow their careers, sometimes their
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.620]   careers oftentimes are highly demanding and they might pull one partner to a different
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.060]   location, to a different office, more hours and then ultimately something has to give.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.260]   How do modern couples manage that where both are super high career oriented, they're
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.780]   working so many hours and they have to travel?
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.140]   Any thoughts and tips on that?
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.900]   Well, I think it's definitely a tricky dynamic.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.260]   It's one where it usually what we've seen from a lot of relationships is first and foremost
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.620]   it starts off with open communication and also just making sure that both partners are
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.380]   aligned on the value behind why that role or that job or that progression is so important
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.780]   and making sure that they both feel comfortable with it.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.300]   I think where we've seen actually the most friction and there's a fantastic book that
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.180]   I'll send you a link for so you can share with everyone where it's a book written about
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.540]   relationship principles by a divorce lawyer.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.980]   And one of the things he talks about is one of the first things that breaks down is really
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.420]   the ability to and desire to communicate about what's important.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.060]   Is this like, how do we think about this?
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.340]   Making sure we're on the same page, that we're acting as a team, even if one person is really
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.100]   the one going out to take that work trip internationally, for example.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.260]   Starting off with communication.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.060]   But I think one of the things that is also helpful is, and I think this is actually where
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.260]   in the '50s and '60s and '70s, this conversation didn't even exist, where there is some more
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.220]   of this concept of taking turns and I support you, you support me, instead of it just being
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.140]   unilaterally in one direction.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.220]   And I think that's also something that we're increasingly hearing and seeing in modern
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.780]   couples relationships, which is more of this, "Hey, it's not just that one person is forever
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.220]   going to support the other person, it's, "Hey, maybe this time it's your turn.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.740]   And maybe next time when there's an opportunity, it's my turn."
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.380]   And I think that's actually so important in having that balance.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.380]   Right.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.820]   Taking turns is a big one.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.780]   I just remember hearing so many stories about, "It's your turn for the next five to 10 years
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.860]   to see how high you can climb in your career."
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.180]   And then, "Okay, now I'm done.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.700]   Maybe it's time to be a stay-at-home parent.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.020]   It's your turn for the next five to 10 years."
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.340]   And that concept is quite interesting.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:22.300]   I do wonder, today's modern couple, how do couples now view divorce?
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.940]   Is it less taboo now than it was back in the day?
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:32.940]   I think people, our generation also uniquely grew up as the generation of, as kids who
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.860]   in the parents' generation, 50% of parents had a divorce.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.140]   And so I think there's actually a much greater awareness.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.500]   One thing that's actually fascinating is that if you look at divorce rates currently in
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.900]   the country and you start to look at it by age, there hasn't been a dramatic change in
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   the rate of divorce for people who are getting married in their late teens and early 20s.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.220]   But if you look at individuals who are getting married more in their late 20s and 30s, currently
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.020]   at least they're trending towards a much lower divorce rate than our parents' generation.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.540]   My theory behind that is having grown up in that dynamic, I think people are more intentional.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.460]   I think there's much healthier conversations about what it takes to build a partnership
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.580]   and a relationship, what's required.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.020]   Even the concept of being vulnerable, being open, having conversations about topics that
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.300]   are hard, having the set of things you should talk about before marriage, these are just
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.860]   becoming increasingly more common conversations and topics that really were more on the fringe
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:43.380]   of what society was really thinking about 30 years ago or 40 years ago.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.860]   And so with Plenty, I decided to build Plenty as a wealth platform for modern couples.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.580]   What does that mean exactly and how does Plenty differentiate itself from other platforms?
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.580]   Great question.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.220]   First and foremost, we're the first wealth platform to really be focused on building
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.740]   for couples.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.180]   As we think about our product functionality, every single product feature and product we
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.880]   offer is really built from that perspective of how do we support these couples who either
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.580]   want to work towards their goals together by actively saving and investing.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.100]   That can be a goal for a home renovation, that can be a goal for buying a home, that
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.460]   can be having a kid, or you can also share information about where you are and what's
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.780]   currently happening by flexibly connecting your accounts, setting some accounts to be
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.820]   private or saying, "Hey, some of these accounts, I'd like to share the information with my
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.820]   partner."
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   So we can have more open conversation, understanding where are we today, what's happening with
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.540]   our money today from a spend perspective, our saving and an investing perspective, and
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.040]   then just making it really easy to say, "Hey, we want to work towards these things together.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.860]   Let's just take action," and you can just directly save and invest with Plenty.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.860]   Right.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.620]   You know, what's interesting is how there's like this, what is it called, bimodal or multiplayer
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.500]   function where you see your own accounts and your joint accounts.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.900]   Tell me a little bit more about that private setting.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:13.140]   In what instances would a couple want to share accounts but keep some of the accounts private?
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   Great question.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.860]   So this is something we hear a lot from our couples, which is in many relationships nowadays,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:26.100]   even if they decide to both deposit their paychecks into the same joint account, it's
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.340]   very common to have some amount of money that is pushed into your own personal accounts,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.340]   and there might even be a credit card that's attached to it so you can spend out of it.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.140]   But oftentimes, we hear couples say, "Hey, it actually feels like more freedom for me
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.980]   to have some credit card or some amount of money where I can just do whatever I want.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.500]   We don't need to check with each other.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.980]   Maybe if it's over a certain dollar amount, then we'll just run it by each other, but
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.100]   hey, there's still like some freedom and it's not fully like each person has to monitor
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.020]   what's going on.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.460]   Each person has a say over every single dollar that's spent."
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.180]   We've seen that and increasingly do believe that that is a relationship best practice
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.700]   where, yeah, there is some transparency, but going from 80% transparency and openness to
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.900]   100%, that's a big difference.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.900]   For a lot of couples, especially when you're so used to managing your own money, you've
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.660]   been independent for so many years, then that's usually that happy media where you're like,
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.940]   "Hey, I still feel like we're still doing most, if not the majority of our financial
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.940]   decisions together, but I still have my freedom.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.460]   You still have your freedom."
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.140]   Whether you want to go invest that yourself, you can do that.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.260]   Whether that is you want to go buy a surprise gift for your partner, you want to go on a
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.340]   trip with your sibling, any of these, that's all open.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.340]   Got it.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.220]   No, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:51.300]   What's interesting is there's this term called financial infidelity where I guess that one
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:57.620]   person or one partner cheats in terms of spending money where he or she shouldn't have or there
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.620]   was no discussions.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:05.260]   What are your thoughts on the concept of financial infidelity and as it pertains to private versus
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.540]   joint and looking at everything?
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.860]   I think financial infidelity, there's a few layers there where it is the most common reason
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.820]   for divorce nowadays.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.380]   I think largely that comes out of a few places.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.620]   One, when couples don't have a place to understand where they are together and they don't have
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:31.140]   a practice of looking at that together, it becomes much easier for one person to be in
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.940]   the know and the other person to really not have an understanding of what's happening.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.780]   We oftentimes, the way we think about this is there's first that layer of deception,
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.740]   which can be intentional or unintentional.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.700]   One of the things is by having a place where you can go reliably to actually see and understand
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.200]   where things are, that's a really important first step to prevent going down that path.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.980]   The other thing that we also think about is there is that act of trying to deceive or
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:09.260]   to hide or actively lying and as part of that, that's usually, and the way we see it is usually
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.540]   those are conversations that just weren't had.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.940]   Whether it is an investment decision, whether that is a spend decision, there is probably
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.740]   before you get to that point of actually having an event that people would consider to be
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.140]   it cheating there, there's many, many years of built-up practice of not knowing how to
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.820]   talk about money together, not feeling like you can easily share with your partner about
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:42.020]   an investment or a spend decision, which are the two most common times when that happens.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.180]   It ends up just being a lot of complication built up over time, where then you get to
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:52.940]   this point where the mistakes, the hiding becomes more common and bigger.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:59.020]   Then usually the thing that's really tough is one person is blindsided by the truth.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.980]   All of that has to play out, but it doesn't just happen overnight.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.820]   I think for many relationships, this is something where they could have had great intentions
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.860]   going in, but this could even have been one person feeling like, "Oh, I want to take care
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.860]   of my family.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.180]   My partner just doesn't quite know and gets overwhelmed with financial information.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.620]   Maybe I'll just do this," and then they try to do what's best for the family and maybe
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.780]   they make an investment decision that's a little bit riskier.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:30.840]   Maybe they'd purchase something for the family, like a whole life insurance plan, for example,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.580]   where they think it's the right thing and they end up not consulting their partner,
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.100]   their partner not really understanding what's going on or being brought along for the journey.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.620]   Then they end up in this situation where maybe there's a negative consequence.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.980]   It was much more expensive.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.420]   It was a bad investment and that shocks the other person who thought everything was okay
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.660]   because they just defaulted to one person taking care of everything.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.060]   It can be much more common and it can be also out of the best intentions, but oftentimes
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.780]   it roots from not having a built-in practice of talking about money together and open.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   Right.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:10.500]   Switching topics a little bit in terms of getting married, do you see more and more
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:17.260]   of your colleagues getting married much later and do you have friends or colleagues who
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.180]   actually regret getting married later because they're too focused on their careers?
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.760]   It's an interesting time.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.660]   Many of the people in my life right now, they're in their 30s and 40s.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.580]   One of the things that we're seeing a lot is both, especially in the urban cities and
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.540]   if you look at a lot of the data, you'll see that the average age for marriage has
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.300]   just consistently gone up.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.660]   Right now we're in urban centers.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.900]   More people are generally getting married in their early 30s and some of the other areas
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.100]   too and more diverse areas around the country that tends to be more your late 20s.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.140]   What we're also seeing is that there is also an increase in the average age where people
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.980]   are starting to have their first child.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.860]   The reality is, is unfortunately our biological clocks have not changed that much.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.220]   There's a lot more technology in terms of being able to have fertility treatments, but
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:18.020]   what actually becomes a much more common conversation in your 30s is also just the cost of fertility
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:24.380]   treatments and sometimes that also becomes something that is so prohibitive that maybe
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.340]   people decide to have fewer kids or are not able to have kids and it was an unexpected
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.820]   consequence of kind of everything, you know, spending more time working, getting married
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.660]   later, potentially meeting your partner later and then you end up in this situation where
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.500]   it's, you know, there are some things that unfortunately you just can't control.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   Right, right.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:51.020]   Do you know the cost of one IUI and one IVF cycle nowadays?
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.840]   So right now what we've seen is for an egg freezing cycle, it depends on the city and
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.460]   I think there's now great programs that have financing, but usually it is between that
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.900]   $12,000 to $25,000 for an egg freezing cycle.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   Wow.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.460]   For many couples that are, you know, and many ladies who are let's say in their mid 30s
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.180]   when they do that cycle, usually they need to do multiple rounds.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.100]   Sometimes you'll get this covered by insurance, but oftentimes very little of it is actually
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.740]   covered by insurance.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.140]   And then what we've also seen from quotes is that the actual IVF treatment is another
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.260]   25 to 50,000 depending on where you're located.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.980]   And again, one round might not be enough.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.940]   You might have to do multiple rounds.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:43.040]   And so it's not uncommon where if you do need support, you're looking at, you know, hundreds
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.300]   of thousands of dollars because you need so many rounds of egg freezing, so many rounds
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.180]   of IVF and hopefully you're able to have a child.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:56.380]   But for so many couples that prices them out in terms of what's reasonable, what's affordable
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.940]   or people end up, you know, taking a second mortgage on their home because that's the
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.940]   only way that's possible.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.840]   I mean, that sounds like a lot.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.140]   So there's egg freezing and there's the IVF cycle.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.180]   I didn't think about the double impact.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:13.400]   So that could be 20 to 50,000 per cycle and there's no guarantee that that cycle will
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.240]   retrieve an egg and implant and, you know, have a successful pregnancy.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.120]   So for listeners out there, 20 to $50,000 is a lot of money.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.840]   So I would say, I would think strategically maybe one is to look at your company benefits
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   and see if they provide that.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.040]   You've heard places like Google and Facebook do that, but you know, those places are tough
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.480]   to get jobs.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.940]   What are some other strategies couples can think about so they don't have to spend all
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.580]   that money and that time?
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.380]   So one tip that I wish more people talked about and it's something where after I saw
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.860]   the data, it was shocking to me was one of the very common, if you look at the statistics,
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.700]   if you're by the time you're in your late twenties and early thirties, if you were to
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.460]   try to donate your eggs, you're actually considered to be an older donor and they actually don't
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.700]   try to get donations for eggs at that point.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.020]   So they really are focusing for a lot of these fertility clinics, they really focus on getting
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.580]   egg donors who are in their early to mid twenties because that's usually when the quality of
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.660]   the eggs are the highest.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.260]   Paradoxically though, the egg freezing industry and a lot of fertility industry focuses on
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.780]   ladies in their thirties and especially the egg freezing.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.980]   It's almost like this strange, you know, reality where it seems like from a business perspective,
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:40.340]   they're focusing on the people who are most likely to want to do it quickly, as well as
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.660]   be able to afford it.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.020]   One thing that you can do is over the course of your twenties and your thirties, there
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:52.180]   usually is a decrease in both quality as well as the quantity of eggs that each woman will
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.220]   have.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:59.340]   And so one thing that you can do as a financial planning decision is actually, I would even
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.660]   think of this potentially like even earlier that you're thinking really about life insurance
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.900]   and all that is you can do your egg freezing at an earlier age, and you're more likely
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.380]   to not need as many cycles to still get more eggs.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.900]   And they're also usually a higher quality of eggs is something, you know, that I ended
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.900]   up being very lucky.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.380]   I talked to a lot of people who had unfortunately been through very hard fertility cycles and
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.980]   treatments, some of which were successful, some of which were.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.820]   And because of that, I ended up making the decision to actually freeze my eggs when I
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.940]   was 27, and it was a financial decision.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:40.340]   I did think of this as an investment, but I also realized and knew that it would actually
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.020]   give me the ability and give me the reassurance to really control a little bit more of the
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.340]   timing for when I might want to have kids.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:54.420]   And a little bit too was like, it's less, you know, the timing for maybe the first child,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.760]   but really if we were thinking of having more than one child, having that is almost the
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   insurance policy.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.860]   Now it's something very lucky, but there's also lots of ways to do your egg freezing
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.740]   cycle in more cost-effective ways, especially if you're willing to go internationally.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   Got it.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.580]   You know, it's interesting because I think it's hard enough for people to save for retirement
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.340]   when they see retirement so far away.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.440]   I wonder if it's even harder for a woman to decide to freeze her eggs if they don't even
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.900]   see someone in their lives yet.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.640]   I mean, what do you think is a harder decision deciding to pay money to freeze your eggs
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.900]   for family planning purposes and cost-saving purposes or to save for retirement?
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:41.700]   I mean, I think if you are an individual who you feel pretty sure and you're pretty calm
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.460]   and central about you want to have kids, it could be one, especially if you haven't met
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.820]   your partner yet.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.080]   That's actually when we've seen most people actually go through an egg freezing cycle.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.240]   It gives you more time.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.380]   It makes you also not feel like as pressured to meet someone quickly because you have a
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.220]   little bit more control and freedom there.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.180]   That was actually one of the things that I completely underestimated was I kind of rationally
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.300]   was like, "Okay, I'll have this insurance policy."
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.620]   What I underestimated was psychologically how much relief I would feel from feeling
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.940]   like, "Oh, I actually do have this, so whether or not we want to take more time, we want
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.460]   to wait a little bit more, I'd like to invest in my career a little bit more," whatever
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.860]   that is, and we make the decision to start trying to have kids later, I still have something
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.980]   covered and it's not like at that time that we need to potentially be thinking about fertility
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.420]   treatments right off the bat.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   Right.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:40.460]   What do you think about the loneliness situation in America in terms of meeting people post-pandemic?
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.420]   Do you feel that people need to spend less time focusing on their careers and making
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.700]   money and saving for retirement and more time focusing on meeting people?
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.860]   Why is it so hard nowadays, especially with all the online ways to meet?
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.940]   Zeezan Sari has this book called Modern Love and there's this one part that he talks
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.500]   about that I absolutely love and I agree with so completely.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.860]   There's this concept that when you have more choice, you're actually strangely less
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.260]   likely to be happy with the choice that you make.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.980]   I think unfortunately with these apps and I've been on them and I've experienced
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:24.340]   them, you get such a high volume of people that both it takes time to interact and engage
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.820]   and be witty and funny and then actually go out on that first date.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:33.460]   But also when you have that first date, you're also more likely to be like, "That was
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.460]   good.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.460]   Is there more?
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.660]   Oh, it's such a low friction to being like, "Oh, I'm just going to keep looking."
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.540]   I think one of the things that he talks about in the book that I appreciated a lot was you
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.780]   can go to a really great Italian restaurant, right?
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.180]   You pull up Yelp or OpenTable and you go to this fantastic Italian restaurant, maybe it's
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.700]   even the best one that you've been to and are you likely to go back or are you more
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.060]   likely to be like, "I want the next best Italian restaurant next time I'm going out
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   for dinner.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   I want variety.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.900]   I want to go somewhere else."
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.300]   I think especially in a place where decades ago there wasn't really the availability
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.740]   of apps in the same way.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.860]   You really had to meet people.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.580]   You actually were spending more time with an individual getting to know them.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.660]   I actually created a little bit of this rule actually after reading this book, which was
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:28.540]   even if it was someone where I was like, "Okay, I think this is interesting," at what scale
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.820]   of good or great, I still commit to a second date.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.180]   I really give and invest the time to get to know someone a little bit more and oftentimes
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   it was actually surprising.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.860]   I realized like first impressions and first dates weren't necessarily predictive.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.940]   I think that's something too where when you have so many choices, you're also less
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:55.060]   likely to invest that time and are you really going to be able to deeply get to know someone
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.020]   over an hour and a half?
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.180]   I think everyone has their own way of doing it, but that's some of the things I'm even
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.180]   thinking about.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.300]   There's also a really great book called The Paradox of Choice written by a psychologist
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:12.620]   about exactly this and so I would also highly recommend that as a read because I think it
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.900]   helps frame up the reality that when you have so much choice, it's not always a better
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.900]   thing for people.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.900]   Right.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.420]   Do you think on the dating app or even in your professional LinkedIn profile, it's
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:30.180]   better to have a better looking picture of yourself than in reality or as close as possible
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.860]   or slightly worse looking picture of yourself than reality in terms of managing expectations?
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:43.220]   Well, I think there is some combination of putting your best foot forward and so I think
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:50.140]   actually the best profiles, you have pictures of you doing the things that you most enjoy,
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.620]   the hobbies, really feeling like you can actually give people a sense of who you are.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:00.020]   I do think that if you're editing the photo, that's probably not a great idea because
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.900]   you don't want someone to meet and then you're like, "Oh, that was completely different
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.020]   from what I thought."
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.980]   I think there's also the stereotypical photos that are fairly overdone, which are like the
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.300]   "I pet the tiger in Thailand" photo and that was very common for a long time and
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:22.660]   I think still is, less in touch with that at this point but I think there is the ability
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.380]   to use the photos to really convey parts of who you are, like maybe you love travel, you
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.940]   love cooking and I think that's actually helpful and important because it just gives
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.460]   people insight very quickly, it's like photos worth a thousand words, like very, very quick
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.460]   essays.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.460]   Right, right.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.980]   It's kind of a chicken or the egg because if you don't have a great photo, that might
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.680]   make you look better than you really are, you might not get any leads.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.140]   But if you have a really great photo and then you meet the person in person, then you might
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.500]   be shocked on the downside.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.540]   So that is an interesting dilemma.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.900]   Personally, I would shoot for more realistic as possible or even below expectations because
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.300]   if you never get the leads, you never know what you're missing, so it's okay.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.340]   And then you can surprise on the upside in person.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.780]   And I also think one of the things that I appreciate, I would say there's all these
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.020]   different apps and they're structured a little bit differently in terms of how you
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.900]   might meet and how you might interact but I do think the ones that really focus on being
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.140]   able to actually put some text that you're answering some questions, there's a little
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.820]   bit of an opportunity, again, to show who you are without using just photos.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:40.700]   When you interact, the number of people I've met who talk about how ineffective apps are
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.500]   for meeting people and then when you dig into it, it's like, "Oh, what's the first
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   message you're sending?"
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   And they're like, "Hey."
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.020]   It's like, "Okay."
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.420]   That wasn't a ton of effort that you put into writing a witty response.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.780]   It's like you got to give someone something to engage with and I think that's also a
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:03.180]   part of being interested, being willing to invest the time and energy to be like, "Hey,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.740]   I came across an individual that I actually think is really interesting.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.940]   I see all these different facets of them.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.960]   Let me actually spend the time to now think about a way to actually engage with them instead
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.700]   of doing like, how do I send 60 Hayes in one night and see if one person gets back to me?"
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.700]   Got it.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.860]   Well, let's talk about Plenty a little bit.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.060]   What type of couple should sign up for Plenty?
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.500]   How can Plenty help them?
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.940]   We typically meet couples at all different stages of their relationship and so really
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.740]   where it starts to make sense is at a time when you're starting to combine your finances.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:43.340]   So where we most commonly see that for a lot of couples is they're really at a point where
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:51.080]   maybe they're engaged and they're tired of doing the Venmo split-wise, per-transaction
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.040]   splitting and they're really thinking about, "Okay, we're building a life together.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.860]   We are actively working towards these big goals."
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.180]   Maybe they're thinking about paying for a wedding, they're thinking about saving towards
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.940]   a house and that's where we often start meeting a lot of couples.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.180]   Another moment that we start to hear a lot of times is at a moment right around when
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.900]   people are getting married, there's much more of a focus on, "Hey, I really want to make
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:19.460]   sure that you're able to have some visibility into our finances, my finances."
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.220]   So that's another moment where once sharing visibility also becomes important, whether
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:31.180]   that's over spending, other accounts we have, 401(k)s, investment accounts, that's another
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:37.540]   moment where there's incremental steps taken to combine finances more and more.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.380]   What we're also seeing a lot of times is when you enter these life moments and chapters
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:48.400]   where you're really tied together in terms of doing things financially, most commonly
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.920]   when you are thinking about buying a house together, when you are thinking about or having
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.220]   a kid together, those are then the other steps.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.780]   I think of it almost as increasingly in our parents' generation, what's very common is
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.660]   you get married usually in your early, mid-20s, and just combine everything day one and everything
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660]   is fully joint.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.980]   Usually you're only at one or two banks.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.060]   What we're seeing a lot of times for couples is that's not the reality and combining finances
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.460]   is actually a set of incremental steps.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.540]   It's almost like going up the staircase, like first staircase is, "Hey, let's start saving
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.780]   and investing together," second staircase is, "We're going to start sharing some visibility
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.340]   in addition to the goals that we have," and then the next step tends to be, "Oh, maybe
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.860]   there's this big life milestone, like buying a house or having a kid," where we're really
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:39.340]   starting to think, and we have more reassurance because we've been together for so many years,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.020]   we've been combining our finances for so many years, where now we're thinking about reducing
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.820]   some of the complexity to maybe cut down on the number of accounts we have and start to
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.580]   consolidate a little bit more of what we're doing and what we have.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.580]   Got it.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.620]   No, I mean it definitely sounds like a great wealth platform to use.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.980]   Where can people sign up?
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.380]   Yeah, great question.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:06.700]   Our website is www.withplenty.com and right now we have a waitlist but are excitedly bringing
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.660]   people on and we are working towards fully launching the product in the first half of
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.660]   the year.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.660]   All right, Emily.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   Well, it was great talking to you.

[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.860]   This was a great conversation.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.860]   All right, everyone.
