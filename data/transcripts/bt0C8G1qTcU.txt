[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, Episode 170.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.000]   Here in the Deep Work HQ, joined as always by Jesse, we're going to be doing a listener
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.440]   calls episode where we take your calls to answer.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.920]   As always, go to calnewport.com/podcast to get the instructions on how you too can record
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.640]   a call for one of these listener calls episodes.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.840]   We are, as we talked about in the last episode, releasing all of these calls on YouTube, you
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.960]   go to our YouTube channel.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.440]   Within a couple days after this episode airing, if all goes well, you should see individual
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.080]   videos uploaded for every call we capture today.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.240]   You will also see a video of the entire episode we do these live from beginning to end one
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.240]   take.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.720]   So if you prefer to watch instead of listen, there will also be within a couple days, the
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.640]   whole episode will be available live online.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.560]   So for now, we'll just put the the link for the YouTube channel will be in the show notes.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.920]   Soon we will have a personalized YouTube URL.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.040]   Jesse can probably fill us in here.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240]   Jesse, there's some rules, right?
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.880]   Like before YouTube will give you youtube.com/somethingsimple, there's some hurdles we have to do, right?
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.120]   Yeah, so we just need 100 subscribers, which we already have, it needs to be up for 30
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   days.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   And I was confused whether that was like unlisted videos or published videos, but I think it's
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   published videos.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.960]   So yeah, just once we hit those things, then we can get a simple name and it'll be rocking
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   and rolling.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.480]   So I at some point in February, we'll have a simpler URL.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   All right, excellent.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.080]   But anyway, it's exciting.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   We're glad to have, you know, everything we talked about available in itself, so that
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   you can save the things you like, you can share the things you like, etc.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.080]   Alright, so we have some good listener calls to get into today.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.220]   First, I want to do a deep dive, I want to do a particular type of deep dive that I introduced
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200]   on Monday's episode, which is the core idea, deep dive.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.080]   This is where I am trying over the next few weeks to capture many of the big ideas we
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840]   come back to all the time on this show.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.060]   And in my writing, capture each of them with its own dedicated deep dive, which Jesse is
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.240]   going to put in its own playlist on YouTube.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.800]   So now you can go back and reference it.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.640]   So when you hear a big idea come up that we talked about a lot, there will then be a deep
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.280]   dive on just that idea you can go back to and reference.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   So I'm going to continue with that.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.960]   On Monday, we did time management.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   Today I want to turn our attention towards the world of careers and do a core idea deep
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   dive on the idea that you should not follow your passion.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.960]   Here's a core idea.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.720]   Don't follow your passion.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.840]   Let me give some background here.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.120]   What do I mean by don't follow your passion?
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.920]   Well, this all goes back to a book I published in 2012 that was called So Good They Can't
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.280]   Ignore You.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   The whole premise of this book was to take a look from scratch at the core question of
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   how do you end up loving what you do for a living?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.320]   I wrote this book as a postdoc at MIT before I took my first professorship at Georgetown.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   Because professorships, if done right, is a job you have for life.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.560]   My thinking was if there was any time in which I would get a lot of leverage out of understanding
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.480]   what makes people end up loving what they do for a living, this was the time that I
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.760]   would get the most leverage out of it.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.940]   This was the time I needed an answer to that question.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.280]   This was a time in which I was cementing what my professional life was going to look like.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.720]   And I said, I better understand how people end up loving their work before I start setting
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   into stone career trajectories that are hard to otherwise later change.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.120]   And so I went and I researched and wrote this book as a postdoc at MIT, trying to answer
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.680]   the question, how do people end up loving what they do?
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.600]   At the time, and continuing until today, the common answer to that question was follow
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   your passion.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   That's by far the most common answer, especially in the American context.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.680]   There are definitely some regional differences here, but definitely in the American context.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.760]   It didn't take much pushing to realize that there are problems with this advice.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   Number one, a lot of people, and by a lot I mean most, don't have clearly defined preexisting
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   passions that they can identify to then follow.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.760]   Real issue if you talk to a bunch of, let's say, 22 year olds just coming out of school,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.800]   and say, look, you got to follow your passion or you're going to be, you know, a miserable
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   sad sack.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   And they say, well, what's my passion?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   I don't know.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.440]   That's a problem.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:13.840]   Second, there is not a lot of good evidence that matching the content of your work to
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.080]   a preexisting interest is a major driver of satisfaction in that job.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.360]   We just assume that's true.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.760]   That advice just assumes that true.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.960]   Oh, I like this thing.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.640]   So if I do that for my job, I'll like my job.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.060]   But we actually don't have a lot of evidence that's true.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.600]   We have a ton of evidence that other factors are much more important.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.880]   Things like autonomy, things like mastery, things like impact, things like connection.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.740]   A lot of other things that are really important for job satisfaction have nothing to do with
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.840]   is the content of my work matching a preexisting interest.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.480]   And we of course have plenty of counter examples of people who build jobs out of hobbies and
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   are miserable.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.080]   I mean, these are cliches.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.720]   The baker, the amateur baker who's miserable as a professional baker, the amateur photographer
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.920]   who's miserable doing six wedding photography gigs per week.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.960]   This is so common, it's a cliche that when you take what you love and say, let me make
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   a job about it, you no longer love that thing.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.520]   That's because the things that makes you really love a job is not me really like this topic.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.880]   Me job now has this topic in it.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.960]   Me now really like my job.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.360]   Way more complicated than that.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.760]   The final issue I'll throw in a third here that I noticed when I was researching So Good
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.460]   They Can't Ignore You is that if you just go out there and grab a bunch of people who
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.160]   love what they do for a living and look at their actual stories, nine times out of 10,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   they were not following a clear preexisting passion.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.800]   So I mean, if this is the universal advice we give, you would expect that it's what most
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.560]   people who love their job did.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.160]   That's why we give this advice.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.920]   Most people don't.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.440]   And the reality is when you just ask someone casually who loves their work, what's your
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   advice?
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.080]   And they say, follow your passion.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.580]   What they really mean is follow the goal of ending up passionate about your work.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.040]   They don't mean identify in advance what you're passionate about, match that to your job,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   and then you will love your work.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   That's not really what they mean.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   It's not really what they did.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.640]   It's just a shorthand.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   But we interpret it as meaning we're wired to do one thing, match our work to that one
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.720]   thing, then we will love our work.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   That's not actually the way it works.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   And you know what, we can't blame people for falling back on that shorthand because the
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.160]   reality of what really matters for building a career you love is complicated.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   We're about to get into it.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.080]   It took me a year of research to really untangle this storyline.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.520]   So we should not expect it when we grab some entrepreneur in a magazine interview and say,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.240]   what's your advice that they'll have this all figured out.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.200]   They just say follow your passion, but they don't really mean it because it's not really
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   what they did.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.800]   They followed the goal about being passionate about their work and how they got there was
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   complicated.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.680]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.640]   How do you get there?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.800]   What I uncovered in my work is that the skill, the what we want to call attributes of a job
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.000]   that makes it great, the properties of a career that makes it something that you love are
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.640]   almost always in demand.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   They're rare and valuable.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.960]   Most jobs don't have them.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.560]   And so if you want those, if you want those in your job, you have to have something rare
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.080]   and valuable to offer in return.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.680]   The world doesn't care that you want to be happy in your job and you think those things
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.360]   would be good for you and you just want them in your job.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   It doesn't care.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.160]   You have to have something to offer in return.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.520]   And almost always the things you have to offer in return is rare and valuable skills.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.800]   So if you want the rare and valuable traits that makes great jobs great in your job, you
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.920]   have to have rare and valuable skills to offer in exchange.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.940]   And therefore the whole game in building a career you love is skill acquisition.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.040]   Step one, get really good at things.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.200]   Step two, use those skills as leverage to shape your career towards the elements that
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.440]   resonate in a way from the elements that don't.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.500]   Get good uses leverage.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.280]   Get better uses even bigger leverage.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.040]   You cultivate over time a career that then is a real source of meaning and satisfaction
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   for you.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   This has nothing to do for nine out of 10 people with leaving college at 22 and saying,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.120]   I am wired and I just know this.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.200]   I've done this my whole life.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.160]   I am wired to be a social media brand manager for a major hotel chain.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.560]   If I could just go get that job, I'm going to be passionate.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   And if I don't, I'm going to be miserable.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.280]   It's not how it works.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.480]   Get good uses leverage, get good use as leverage.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   I ended up calling this career capital theory.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.240]   As my metaphor is, as you get good at things that are rare and valuable, you are acquiring
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.000]   more career capital.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.480]   You then must invest that capital to get returns in your job that are positive.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.040]   So I use that metaphor of career capital.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.880]   Two quick follow up.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.080]   One, how do you do that?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   How do you get good at things?
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.840]   How do you build rare and valuable skills?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.540]   The short answer is deliberate practice.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:06.720]   You need to very carefully figure out what's valuable in your current career or job area
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.800]   and then train to get better at that deliberately, like an athlete adding a new jump shot to
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.240]   their repertoire or a chess player mastering a new in-game strategy.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.040]   Specific activities designed to stretch you past where you're comfortable on things you
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   know are valuable.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.580]   You got to be training yourself to get better.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.880]   That's how you get career capital fast.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.680]   So you move towards passion very quickly.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.940]   Two, how do you know what to do with that career capital?
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.840]   How do you know, like, what do I want to invest that career capital to get in exchange?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.760]   When I say you want to invest that capital to move your work towards things that resonate
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.200]   and away from things that don't, you might be suspicious that I'm just being circular
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.620]   here and somehow it all comes back to some preexisting passion.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.160]   But no, it's much more complicated here.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.840]   What do I mean by moving your work towards things that resonate away from things that
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.160]   don't?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.240]   What you need to do here is what we call on this show, lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.960]   You have to, through reflection and experimentation, fix in your mind a very clear image of what
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.920]   you want your life to be like.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   All the elements of your life.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.800]   You're really like imagining typical days in a way that just you feel this intimations
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   of that's right.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.520]   That's what I want my life to be like.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   Where do you live?
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.080]   What type of place do you live?
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080]   Where are you working?
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   How much work are you doing?
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.280]   What else are you doing with your time?
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.320]   What's happening with your family or your community?
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   Are you in the woods all day?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   Are you in a high rise?
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.600]   Are you in this vision?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.680]   Are you a master of the universe type that's making deals and moving things?
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.220]   Or are you a Bill McKibben type cross-country skiing in the snow for three weeks before
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.720]   writing one article the next week?
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.240]   You really just want to have this feel of what type of lifestyle resonates with me as
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.600]   deep.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   What I want.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.240]   And then you work backwards from that.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.360]   Okay, what I'm trying to do now is build up rare and valuable skills in my job so that
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.720]   I have leverage and then use that leverage to shape the way my work unfolds.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.020]   What I work on, when I work on the arrangement for my work, all of that.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.680]   So it is pushing me more towards this image of the optimal lifestyle for me and away from
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.040]   things that are contrary to that to that lifestyle.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.640]   So you're working backwards from a clear image of the lifestyle.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.360]   And the way you get there is not by saying at 22 to your boss, I want to live in the
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   woods.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   I want a lot of free time.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.440]   I'm going to cross-country ski all day.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.360]   So I want my work to be just stuff I'm interested in.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.680]   And I only work on on Monday and Fridays and they get paid really well.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.640]   The boss will say in that context, that's great.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.240]   Good luck with that.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.840]   Can you get your stuff off the desk there?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.360]   Because the person we just hired to replace you is here and they need to get back to work.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   That's not how you do it.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.840]   How you do it is you become so good.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.120]   You can't be ignored.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.840]   They're desperate to keep you.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.080]   And now you're able to start adjusting.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.200]   Well, you know, I'm going to work part-time or I don't do this type of work that goes
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   to the entry level.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.600]   I'm not the entry level anymore or pay me by my performance.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.960]   I want to shift to a pseudo consulting type contract.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.160]   You pay me by my performance.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.680]   All of that requires I have gotten very good and that requires that you train.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.780]   All right, so let me pull together these pieces.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.000]   This is not as sexy as the Disney version fairy tale of you were wired for one job.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.480]   And if you can figure out what that is, there will be fairy dust in the air and you'll be
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.580]   happy in your career from then on out.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.780]   And conversely, if you don't like your job, if you find it hard or there's anything that's
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.880]   hard about it, that's because you have the wrong position.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.300]   If you just quit and try something else, you're almost there.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.420]   Then everything will be easy when you get the right job.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.780]   The storyline I'm going to give you is much harder than that, but it actually works.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.400]   So the compress everything I just said here, don't obsess too much about what job you take.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.960]   Yes, the choice matters, but you know, any job that matches your interest in some sense
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.720]   and it's going to give you good options if, and when you get better is good enough.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.000]   Don't obsess over some dream job or having just the right job to train like an athlete.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   What matters?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.860]   I'm going to systematically improve that skill.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   No one else in your job is going to be doing that.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.920]   So you're going to start getting advantages opening up really soon.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.720]   Three, use the resulting career capital to as leverage to push your career towards things
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.080]   that resonate and things and away from things that don't.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.640]   And you, your compass for that is lifestyle centric career planning, very clear image
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   of what you want your days to be like all the elements of your days.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.560]   And so what can I do to make my life more like that and get away from the stuff that
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   gets in the way.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.580]   Do those three things, give yourself five years.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.600]   You will probably be pretty happy in your job.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.640]   Give yourself another five years.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.880]   You might be downright passionate about it, but then just what you have to do for me is
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.680]   when someone fresh out of college looks up at you and says, well, how did you do it?
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.380]   How do you have this cool job where you ski all day or whatever?
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.520]   Don't just say, follow your passion.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.260]   Say it's kind of complicated.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.480]   Go watch this video at Cal Newport's YouTube page.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.880]   All right.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.040]   So there's the core idea.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.720]   I'm glad to get that down because we talk about this, this career stuff a lot.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.880]   So now I can point people towards point towards this idea, but I want to get on the questions.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.800]   Jesse, let's do some calls.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280]   What do we have here for our first call?
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   All right.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   The first call is from Vanessa.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   She has a question about time management.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.680]   She works in AI and she has a bunch of other stuff going on.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   So we'll take a listen and see what she has to say.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   Hi, Cal.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:27.480]   My question to you is that in a recent podcast, you talked about dividing your time into maximum
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.240]   two areas that you want to grow in.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.920]   For me, those areas are space and artificial intelligence.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   And although my degree is in my under, I'm studying, I'm doing my undergrad in software
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.280]   engineering.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:52.840]   I do feel like my time and attention is divided with obligations that are uncontrollable,
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   like obligations at home.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.640]   I work two part-time jobs and I'm doing school.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:08.280]   So I don't feel like I have the time to do what I want to do.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.000]   And it's almost uncontrollable.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.920]   So I was wondering if you had any advice for that.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.800]   So Vanessa, it's a well-timed question.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.120]   I think the deep dive I did earlier in this episode is actually really relevant here about
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.440]   how you actually craft careers that are a real source of meaning.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   The advice I'm going to give you is actually going to be slow down.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.720]   Let me elaborate this a little bit.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.920]   You're in a moment now where you're training in school and you're working two part-time
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.200]   jobs to essentially support yourself while you're in school.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   I'm actually going to suggest just do school well, do your part-time jobs well, and don't
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.400]   be pushing pretty hard on anything else right now.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   That's a hard setup.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.880]   It can be hard enough just to find time to get that schoolwork done.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.160]   Your learning software engineering is a great foundation.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.040]   I'm assuming the degree from your school is then going to allow you to consolidate and
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.240]   clean up your professional situation.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.280]   The part-time jobs are going to go away.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.940]   You're going to have one job that's going to be a skilled job, probably something in
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.240]   software given your degree.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   So that's going to be step two.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.880]   I'm still going to advise that you start slow.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.520]   I give this advice a lot on the podcast.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.480]   When you're new to a job, you want to make sure that you're dependable.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.040]   You don't let things fall through the cracks.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.480]   Someone tells you to do something, you do it.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.640]   You tell them when it's going to get done.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.560]   If you can't get it done in time, you tell them in advance and deliver it where you say
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.400]   you're going to deliver it like they trust you.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.360]   And again, the secret there is just use my time management philosophies, capture, configure,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   control.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.440]   You'll seem like a rock star by comparison to everyone else.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.960]   And two, deliver things at a high level of quality.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.720]   I'm going to give myself enough time to do this.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.880]   I'm going to start in advance.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   I'm not going to rush it.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   I'm going to ask questions.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   I can deliver good stuff.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.680]   You just want to do that for a year just to lay a foundation.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.720]   So you have the job now you're done with school.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   You've laid a foundation.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.640]   You have your first inklings of career capital.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.320]   So your first leverage, you know, in your career.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.480]   Now I would start thinking, okay, what's the plan?
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.000]   If the plan is I want to get into AI pretty hardcore, and then I want to apply that to
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   the space sector.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.700]   Now you can start thinking through what's my plan at that point.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.120]   And it might be, okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my leverage to keep my
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120]   workload reasonable.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.480]   I'm going to throw a lot of Cal Newport time management at it so I can do a phantom part-time
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.520]   job.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.840]   And I'm going to bring into my life at this point, a side project that's going to push
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.720]   my AI abilities up really good because I have a one-year plan, or I'm going to do this for
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.840]   a year and shift over to an AI type position.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.880]   And then once I'm in the AI type position, I'm going to earn my stripes there and then
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.460]   move into their division that's working on space related things.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.360]   Now you can start really laying out these plans.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   What do I want?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   What do I want my lifestyle to look like?
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   How do I build up those skills?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.800]   I know it's probably a sense of impatience pervades your situation right now.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.120]   Like, can't I just be doing this now?
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.560]   But you've got a lot on your plate, Vanessa.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.200]   I mean, you're doing multiple jobs in school.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.680]   So crush it in your classes, learn the stuff well, give yourself a break.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.320]   So like really cherish the free time you have right now.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.680]   Then choose a good job after this that's going to have options if and when you get better.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.360]   Be dependable, deliver quality for your Leta Foundation.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.840]   And then you start putting your foot down on that gas pedal and you start really aggressively
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   moving towards this really cool vision you have of what your life could be like.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.400]   So you're going slow now, Vanessa, but you're going to be going very fast in about a year
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.860]   or two from now.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.700]   And I think that's something you can be excited about.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:41.320]   But by pacing yourself, you can also avoid burning yourself out or setting yourself objectives
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.480]   that are impossible to the frustration of having objectives that are really probably
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.320]   impossible to meet right now.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.240]   All right.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   Good call.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   Space and AI.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.040]   What do we got, Jesse, for call number two?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   Next question.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.580]   We have another mom and she has a question about how to implement some of your ideas
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.600]   from a world without email.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.080]   Hi, Cal.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.600]   My name is Madeline.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.680]   Prior to staying at home the last five years to raise my three young kids, I received my
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.640]   MBA and was an internal strategic consultant for a large healthcare company.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   Much of the work I did was to create quarterly plans, identify and track key project metrics,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.800]   and develop and implement process improvement projects.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.320]   Very in line with the recommendations you've laid out in a world without email.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.760]   I first want to thank you for creating a language and culture around the deep life and clarifying
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.520]   why this type of structure is important.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.560]   Looking back at my prior role, I sometimes wavered in my confidence to hold people accountable
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.220]   to the systems we developed because it felt like additional work for them.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.280]   My question is, after being out of the workforce, I like to reenter and coach small businesses
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.640]   on the productivity tools I did in my previous job and also the theories and recommendations
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.640]   you've laid out.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.720]   Do you have any thoughts on how someone can help small businesses implement your concepts?
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.200]   I plan to work part time, but also I would love to collaborate with other consultants
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.080]   doing this type of work.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.560]   Any recommendations would be much appreciated.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   Thanks so much in advance.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.960]   Well, it's a great space.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   It's a great space.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.640]   This is my read having published a world without email is that there is an immense hunger out
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:27.760]   there at all levels within companies to figure out better alternatives to simply, you're
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.220]   on email, you're on Slack, let's just rock and roll and hope things get done.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:39.600]   That hyperactive hive mind approach, the hyperactive hive mind approach I describe and dissect
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.340]   in detail in my book, a world without email is not working and people recognize this,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:52.120]   whether we're talking about the small business entrepreneur or the CIOs of major corporations,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.900]   which in both cases, I have had these conversations recently.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.480]   So I think this is a great space to get into.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.300]   I don't actually have a good process for helping companies develop these processes.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.100]   I kind of wish I did because I get asked to do this a lot, which is why I'm glad Madeline
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.200]   that you're thinking about doing this and that I think this is going to be a big space
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.980]   in consulting for lots of people.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.420]   There's gonna be a lot of room for this.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.500]   Typically what I tell people is I'm an idea guy.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.540]   I come in, I study the issue, what's going on here.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.900]   I get really deep into the issue.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.740]   What are the actual roots of the issue and then try to figure out philosophically what
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:35.300]   you would have to change to improve this problem, but I'm not in the world of business.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.260]   So you don't want me to come into your business and start giving specific advice on how your
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.180]   business runs because I don't know how businesses run.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.580]   So I don't have a good process for this, but I think there are good processes to be constructed.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:53.860]   I think it's going to be a major sector of the sort of knowledge work, management, consulting,
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.380]   the world, that sector.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.700]   I think helping companies develop processes to sidestep the hyperactive hive mind is going
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.600]   to be a big deal.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.940]   So Madeline, I would say probably you should have some sort of process you follow that
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.420]   you're willing to evolve very quickly as you actually try it out there in the real world.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.900]   I would say I've learned you need to probably learn more about a team than you think before
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.140]   you're ready to propose things.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.020]   There's often very, you have to surface these hidden dynamics that you don't really know
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.020]   about, but they're actually driving a lot of how work actually gets done.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.220]   And three, I would say it's important that you eat your own dog food here.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.660]   So make sure that you run your consulting firm very much aligned with these ideas, that
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.420]   it's not just, yeah, email me whenever.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.620]   Just hit me up on Slack and we'll figure out the contract.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   You should have very clear processes that you love, that you can communicate clearly
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.060]   and that clients will enjoy that clarity because then they will see that you're the change
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.060]   you want to see in the world.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.540]   They will see you do it and get a sense of what it's going to look like when they do
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.340]   it as well.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.380]   I might point you towards Jenny Blake's new book, which is a book I believe it's called
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.380]   Free Time.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.820]   And it comes out in March, but I did an interview with her in December on the podcast.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.900]   You can go back to that episode and learn about a lot of the ideas.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.220]   But it's a whole book about how to do this with your small consulting style business,
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.980]   how to figure out your processes, what to focus on, what not to focus on.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.620]   So read that book.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.980]   It'll help you with what you're doing and it might give you ideas on how you can help
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.220]   other companies do the same thing.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.300]   All right, but that's good to hear.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.420]   I do, I mean, Jesse, I think this is going to be a huge sector doing this type of consulting.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.260]   I mean, it makes my eyes bleed thinking about me doing it.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.660]   I mean, could you imagine something worse than me, just individually me being in like
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:50.100]   a corporate boardroom and having these sort of jargon filled small talks about how their
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.620]   team, their Q2 quarterly metrics.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.540]   And like, I'd be terrible at it because after like half hour, I'd be like, you guys should
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   all just go write books.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   Like, this is crazy.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   What are you doing here?
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   This is a terrible job.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.140]   So I would be terrible at it.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.380]   But other people would be great at it.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.740]   And it's going to make a lot of people's lives better if their companies actually get rid
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.740]   of this hive mind.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   Just don't ask me to do it.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.500]   All right.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.980]   So what do we got?
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.820]   Next question we got from Michael.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.660]   He's in operational technology and he's got a question about estimating time to complete
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.660]   a task.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.660]   Hi Cal, Michael from sunny Ballarat, Australia here.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.500]   I work in operational technology where the real things happen.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.660]   So studies suggest we're terrible at estimating time required to complete a task and then
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.340]   getting started is half the battle.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.700]   I feel like there is competing thoughts on how to deal with this.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.380]   On one hand, a task will expand to the time allocated to it.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.580]   So allocate a short time and just get what you can done as a forcing function.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.900]   On the other hand, take your estimated time needed to complete it and double it to make
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.860]   sure you don't over commit or over schedule yourself.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.660]   I'm always running out of time in a block or finishing early.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.140]   How do you approach this tension?
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.020]   Well, Michael, the good news is that you are time blocking.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:17.700]   So if you're time blocking, you have a hope of actually figuring out how long things actually
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.700]   take.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:24.020]   It's one of the great advantages of time blocking is that you get real time feedback.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.780]   I gave this type of work this much time on my time block plan for today and I did not
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.940]   hit that time.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.860]   How do I know because I had to build a repaired schedule next to it because I blew past that
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.740]   time.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.220]   Most people don't get this feedback, right?
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.780]   They're just like, what do I want to work on next?
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.740]   They kind of work on something and it takes longer than they think.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.900]   And then they're scrambling at the end of the day.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.440]   But they don't get that clear feedback for three weeks from now when that same thing
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.620]   is on their plate that they think, oh, wait, I actually need to start this a little bit
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.620]   earlier.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.820]   This really takes this much time.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.500]   If you're not giving every minute a plan and seeing how well that plan unfolds, you're
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.860]   really not internalizing this feedback.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.220]   So this double the time you put aside rule, that is useful when you are new to time blocking,
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.220]   or at least when you're new to time blocking a particular type of activity.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.700]   Yes, our instinct is we schedule not enough time.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.020]   What I usually tell people if they're new to time blocking is 50% more doubling would
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.740]   be a little bit more conservative, but people really underestimate at first.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.140]   However, and this is the real benefit.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:29.580]   You won't have to keep doing that forever, because you will get better at these estimates.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.460]   So you put down time, when you hit it, you're happy when you don't, you're don't.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.000]   You're getting reinforcement here.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.820]   Do this for a few weeks, you're putting down the right amount of time.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.420]   So if you're time blocking, yes, there's a place for this heuristic of just add more
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.260]   time than you think.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.820]   But it's only when you get started.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.800]   If you're more or less hitting it just about right, then you say, okay, I know how much
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.140]   this takes.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.500]   And then you can then you can stick with that time.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.200]   So that's what I would suggest is, if you're blowing past your blocks, use a 50% rule.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.700]   If that's working, then stick with it, you're probably right about where you need to be.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.500]   So you'll get better at this as you keep practicing with your blocks.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.780]   All right, we're pretty technical today, Jesse, I think we had a call about process consulting,
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.340]   we got an operation technologist talking about time blocking.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.660]   So we're sort of in the sort of in the business weeds today.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.460]   Yeah, are we keeping that up with the next one?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.460]   What's the next one?
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.820]   Next one's a little different.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.500]   It's a question about designing household space for better productivity.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   Nice.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.260]   Hey, Cal, big fan of the show.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.060]   Coming in today with a question about household space and productivity.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.980]   My fiance and I just moved into a two bedroom apartment.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:49.380]   There's plenty of space, but what we're finding our trouble is, is how we set up what areas
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.940]   are for what we're trying to keep the bedroom is certainly no technology.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.660]   Our living room, we're trying to keep that the same way.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.980]   And our other bedroom we're using as an office space as well as a workout space with a stationary
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.340]   bike and some other equipment.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:11.980]   What we're finding troubling is how do I determine how to separate my work time from my workout
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:19.140]   time if I'm at the desk doing work for my career versus having to do some paying bills
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.260]   and all that.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   We really don't want to bring the laptops out into the kitchen or the living room area,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.300]   but are also having trouble not when sitting at the desk thinking about work.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.580]   Any clues or tips you might have on that would be appreciated.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.580]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.580]   Okay, good question.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.300]   So first of all, I think this is obvious.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:43.180]   You need to take one of those bedrooms and that needs to be dedicated to Cal Newport
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.000]   related material is where you want to have a whole wall for my books.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.620]   You want to have a whole wall for my planners, a really good stereo system for playing the
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.300]   podcast with a chair that's just aimed at it.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.500]   Like that should be priority one and then everything else can fit into your main bedroom.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.500]   Now assuming you don't want to do that, which would be my suggestion, I have a couple things
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.100]   I'll say here.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.740]   All right.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.900]   So you're basically putting everything work and exercise related in the one room.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.040]   That's not a bad idea.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.740]   Maybe you could think about exercise as something that you also interleave throughout the workday.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.860]   You know, if you're working from home anyways with your equipment there, 20 minute rides,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.740]   some push-ups, like going back and forth between exercising and work is actually a pretty good
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.740]   rhythm for work.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.940]   So you might not actually want to separate those as much as you think.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:42.420]   When it comes to breaking up household work from other type of work, small, I think it's
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.020]   the right way to say this, small changes to the environment.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:53.220]   So small contextual changes can go a long way when it comes to trying to change your
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   mindset.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:31:01.380]   And what I mean about this is that you can have a slightly different setup for bills
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.500]   or what have you, then what you do in the same room for your normal work.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.020]   And that little change in context can make a big difference where you can do the bills
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.860]   or what have you without falling back into that mindset of regular work.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.340]   So like one thing you could do is have a very small desk or table that is separate from
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.340]   your main desk, right?
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.060]   So you could imagine a setup where against one wall, you've built a long desk that both
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.740]   you and your fiance can both sit and you bring your computers there and you have all your
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.020]   files there.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.500]   And then over in another corner is a very small desk, kind of like they used to use
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   if you look at the Victorian age where they'd have those stationary desks, where it's like
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.380]   very tall with a very narrow desk in front of it, you'd go and you would write your correspondence
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.380]   on or something.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.120]   So these are shallow desks.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.140]   You have something like that in a different corner of the room.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.780]   Right next to it is the filing cabinet for your household stuff.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.740]   It seems like it's the same room, but that context makes a difference.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.220]   I'm at this desk on my laptop doing email.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.420]   Now it's Sunday afternoon.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.020]   I want to pay some bills and take care of some of that type of work.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.620]   I don't want to think about email and I don't want to think about my job.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.280]   You go in that same room, but you're going over to that other little desk.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.840]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   That's the bill desk.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.100]   That's different than the work desk.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.180]   So I think you do that.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.920]   You can get a lot out of the same space.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.220]   The other contextual cues you can do is with lighting and music.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.720]   Okay, when I'm doing deep work in this desk, I have the lights low except for one bright
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.980]   spot on my desk.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.320]   When I'm doing email, I have the lights higher.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.080]   When I'm doing exercising, we do something different, right?
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   Those type of cues can matter as well.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.260]   So small cues, give your mind what they need to know that this is a different context than
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.700]   this, even if you're in the same physical space.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.060]   So I think that's a good idea.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:48.140]   The final thing I would suggest is be in the habit of using that office is where your phones
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.580]   go.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.840]   So I'm a big proponent of what I call the phone for your method, which says when you're
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.960]   at home, you do not keep your phone with you in your pocket.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.820]   Just like 25 years ago, you didn't just pick up your old fashioned telephone with a very
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.220]   wide long wire, just walk with you wherever you went in the house, carrying this phone
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   with you.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.940]   That'd be eccentric, but we do that with our portable phones.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.340]   And so it's always there for distraction.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.900]   So I say, when you come home, your phone's going to a set place, you plug them in and
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.860]   you charge them.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.580]   If you need to make a call, you go there.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.820]   If you need to text someone, you go there.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.220]   If someone's calling you, you go there.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.740]   If you want to see if someone texted there, you go there.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.540]   If you want to look something up, you go there.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.540]   And that's where your phone is.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.180]   It's not with you as a default distraction.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.380]   I call it the phone for your method, because if you're in a house, you might have a foyer
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.380]   by your front door.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.380]   It's a good place for it.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.260]   You have a two bedroom apartment, use that one apartment, that one room for it.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.820]   Go in there, we plug in our phones, we can put the ringer on high.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.460]   So we'll hear it if someone's calling or something.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.140]   And that's where we go to use our phone.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.660]   That is, I think, a great setup.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.340]   We have a living room and a bedroom that you don't look at your phone in, you don't do
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.820]   email in, you don't do work in.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.700]   And then you have this multi-purpose room where you have exercising in there, you have
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:05.300]   your main work in there, you have your phone interaction in there, you have your household
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.660]   admin like Bill Payne in there, you have your Cal Newport shrine in there that takes up
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.940]   most of the room, and the context is just slightly different between all of those different
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.940]   things.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.380]   And so when you're switching from one thing to the other, your mind knows it's different
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.980]   and it doesn't invade it all into the other parts of your life.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.860]   I think you do that, you're going to have a great setup for your house and you really
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.660]   would be taking advantage of the way your brain actually works.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.580]   All right.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.380]   We should have a shrine.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.680]   We don't have a shrine in here, Jesse, but we do have some various things that fans have
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.860]   sent us that maybe to the outside eye is a little bit shriney.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.900]   Do you have your bookshelf?
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.540]   I have the bookshelf, but I don't have all my books up there yet because I ran out of
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.660]   shelves and I got too lazy to buy more.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:35:00.300]   But someone sent us a comic book artist did an illustration of me as a superhero, heavily
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   muscled.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.820]   You've seen that out by the refrigerator.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.260]   And then a class I gave a talk to, they did a lot of original illustrations about me and
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.440]   my life, like hand drawn illustrations.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.140]   The ones I have on the wall in the main room.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:18.740]   Both of those are a little out of context, maybe oddly shrine-like.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.820]   I think out of context, that might be weird.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.420]   But the idea was here in the HQ, we're going to put it up in a way.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.720]   Brings up another issue.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.500]   People are asking for a look inside the HQ video.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.580]   So here's what we should do, and we're going to do.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.660]   I want to decorate the HQ better.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.660]   You know this, right?
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.140]   I'm just bad about this.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.820]   When you came, I had to buy some chairs.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.180]   So when you started working for me, I only had one chair.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.380]   So that's what I did.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.960]   But we still are missing a lot, right?
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.900]   Because I'm just weird with decorations and I'm lazy.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.580]   And so I think we got to figure that out.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:57.820]   We got to have a plan for it.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.180]   And then I think the video should be before after.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.220]   Like, okay, let's tour the HQ as it stands now.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.220]   That's a good idea.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.340]   And then we do some work or hire some people to help us do some work.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:14.100]   And then here's how it looks after we're done.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   So then it would be a forcing function.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.100]   Because we got to get stuff on the walls.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.940]   We got to get-- we probably have to get rid of those old desks and do something cooler.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.140]   We should have better seating.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.580]   We should get a good TV in there.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.080]   There's so much we probably-- People will want to see your board.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   People want to see the board.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.860]   Oh, yeah, we have the whiteboard in there.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.700]   I asked my listeners once to send me suggestions for the HQ.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.140]   But I don't know.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.820]   I used to call it the cave back then.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   And some of the suggestions were a little on the nose.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.580]   Like someone wanted me to actually build a cave with plaster of Paris, stalagmites, and
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.580]   stalactites or whatever.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:56.660]   I was like, okay, maybe we should not outsource this one.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.580]   But anyways, we're committing now.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.660]   We're committing now on air.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.380]   Jesse and I are going to-- Yeah, we'll put out some videos.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.660]   We'll put out some videos of what it looks like in here.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.700]   And then we're going to make it look nicer.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.700]   And then we'll put out another video.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.540]   And you'll be like, ah, now it looks nicer.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.740]   And it'll be a huge shrine.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.940]   It'll be like really embarrassing.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   All right.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.740]   Do we have one more question?
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.660]   Yeah, we have one more question.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.660]   It's from a student.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.500]   And he has a question about starting for a highly competitive exam.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.540]   All right, let's do it.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.540]   Hello, Carl.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.540]   Shubham here from India.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.540]   Firstly, thank you so much for your podcast and books.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.180]   Your books have profoundly influenced my academic career and life in general.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.380]   As a student preparing for civil services examination, one of the highly competitive
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.940]   examination held in India, the only way I think to stand out is to putting extra number
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.980]   of deep work hours in the preparation.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:58.820]   Any tips for that and in general about cracking and highly competitive examinations?
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   Thank you.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.700]   Yeah, I used to deal with these questions a lot when I was doing primarily student-focused
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.500]   advice back in my early days.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:14.820]   The big high-level point that applies to any high-stakes examination and really sort of
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:22.280]   any high-stakes grading situation is to make sure that your approach to preparing is what
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.540]   actually matters and not what you want to matter.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.740]   That's the most common trap that happens here is that people write a story in their head
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.780]   of what they want preparation for this exam to be.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.380]   And it matches something that's typically it's some sort of activity that it's hard
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.700]   enough to feel fulfilling, but not so hard that it's really going to cramp their life
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.060]   or be too hard.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.580]   Or they just like the idea of it and they just throw hours at it and they just want
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.780]   that to be what matters.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.580]   And often what really matters for doing well for the exam might be completely different
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.100]   and actually require a lot less time once you know what it is.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:01.460]   So you got to figure out what really matters for passing the India Civil Service Entrance
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.460]   Exam.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.940]   And the way you figure that out is you talk to people who have done it and know about
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.980]   it from direct experience.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   And you say, what mattered?
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.820]   What was the prep you did that really was useful and what was the waste of time?
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.500]   And you talk to five people like this.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.060]   And if it's a big enough exam, there might be books on it, you read the books too.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.620]   You figure out what really matters.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:26.140]   And then you get a realistic picture of this is what I, the activities I actually need
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.220]   to do, the activities I actually need to do to prepare for this exam.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.460]   And then you find the time for it.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.900]   Okay, well, how much is that going to take?
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.380]   And so how early do I have to start?
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.780]   Then where do I want to put that on my calendar?
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.540]   And you should autopilot schedule it.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.340]   Let me get that all in my calendar in advance, the same times on the same days.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.080]   And then you just execute and you're executing the stuff that matters.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.580]   If you're really working backwards from focusing on what people know from experience makes
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.980]   the difference is probably less time than you think for God's sakes, it's much less
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   time.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.500]   If you come at this with the mindset of just, this is a morality set up, like the more sacrifice
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   I do, the more I'll be rewarded.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.220]   So let me just make sure I'm miserable and doing lots of hours.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.580]   Your hours are only interesting to me as a secondary side effect of you figuring out
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.380]   what prep matters and you scheduling it.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.060]   And then that'll take whatever it takes.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.060]   Hours are not a planning tool.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.420]   Trying to hit another hours is not a planning tool.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.300]   Trying to hit a certain level of misery or so you feel like you're at least trying hard
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   means nothing.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.140]   All I care about is, are you doing the actual concrete activities you have evidence work?
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.100]   Did you give yourself enough time to get those all done?
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.580]   Do those things when you've done them, you're done.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.780]   If you don't, you're not, that's it.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.660]   The real differentiating factor when it comes to high stake test, the people who figure
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.060]   that out and the people who want it to be some sort of more morality play about sacrifice
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.180]   and sweat, that's not the way it works.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.140]   Here's an example from my own days in college.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:53.100]   So I went to an Ivy League school here in the US and had a lot of friends go to Harvard
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.700]   Law School after college.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:02.180]   Which by the way, side note, naive public school kid I was going to this Ivy League
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:09.340]   school was completely surprised that most of the people I know went to Harvard Law School.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:15.020]   Because in my mind, I didn't have this mindset of like, these are the professional tracks
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.020]   that are allowed.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.460]   Of course, this is why you went to the school so that you can then go to Harvard and then
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   get a law firm job.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.300]   I just thought everyone was going to be professors and journalists and start nonprofits and cool
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   companies.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   No, they all went to Harvard Law School.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.020]   Because I was from a naive public school background.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.100]   So I didn't realize like, oh, these are all pathways.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.300]   You become a doctor or a lawyer or a management consultant or finance and you go through
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   these schools and whatever.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.380]   So you look at that from the outside, you're like, man, how did all these kids get into
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.380]   Harvard Law School?
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:49.540]   And depending on your orientation on the optimist, pessimist scale about human nature, you think
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.620]   it's one of two things.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.100]   Either they must all just be brilliant.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.860]   Man, I'll never be like that.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   Look at these smart kids.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.220]   They all can just go into Harvard Law School.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.660]   Or you say, yeah, it's all just like what school you went to.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.660]   And look at that pipeline.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.940]   You just for free get to go to Harvard Law if you go to an Ivy League school.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.820]   And so it's just perpetuating sort of entrenched privilege.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:17.780]   But there's a third element here that I noticed up front, which was they systematically figured
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:24.420]   out what is needed to accomplish this goal.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.660]   And they looked up-- there's these matrices you could look up, first of all, that shows
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:35.100]   you with your current GPA, what LSAT score would you need to have a high percentage of
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.420]   being accepted into Harvard Law School?
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.140]   And they all looked at this, and they all looked at their current GPAs and said, great,
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.540]   I have to get this LSAT score.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.180]   So they're specific.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.780]   And they figured out by talking to people who had gone before and gotten good scores
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.180]   on the LSAT, what really matters.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.180]   And it was practice.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.660]   A lot of it was practice, real tests under real conditions.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.060]   You would learn some techniques and do real tests under real conditions.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:03.300]   And so they organized a club internally where they would just do these tests, real LSATs
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.940]   under real conditions, again and again and again, until their scores hit exactly this
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.340]   number that the statistics told them would give them a good chance of being accepted.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340]   And then they were done.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340]   And they went and took the LSAT.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   And they got that score.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.680]   And they got into Harvard.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.760]   The reason why I tell the story is to show what they were doing there is what often happens
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.620]   when you see people who do very well in high-stakes testing is they figured out, what do I really
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:27.620]   need to do?
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.620]   And how do you actually do it?
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.620]   And they put aside the time.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.540]   And these students, my memory is they spent a whole quarter working on this.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:38.820]   They're like, OK, we're probably going to end up having to dedicate-- I'm trying to
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.140]   add this up in my head-- 100 hours of work on this to get our LSAT scores to where they
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.140]   are.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.380]   So we got started early.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.980]   And we do this every Friday or whatever, every Thursday morning.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.580]   And let's just go.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.380]   So I just use it as an example of this is the key to anything high-stakes is get the
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:02.060]   ground truth evidence, what really matters here, and confront that for better or for
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.060]   worse.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.660]   This is what I would actually have to do to prepare for this.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.140]   And then try to find time to do it.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   Build your schedule.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.140]   Start early to fit it in.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.780]   And then either do the work or you don't.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:18.200]   But do not invent your own story for what you think should matter.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.380]   Do not just retreat to storylines about there's nothing I can do because I'm not brilliant.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.420]   So I'll just never get a good score.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   No.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   It's work.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.680]   Like, how do I get to where I need to get?
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.820]   So figure out the real solution.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.300]   Do the real work.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.460]   It's not very exciting.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:39.060]   But honestly, that's how the world turns with most of these types of high-stakes exams anyways.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.060]   All right.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.020]   So I'm looking at the time here.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.140]   We should probably wrap this up.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.380]   So thank you, everyone, who called in.
