[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.440]   So for today's deep dive, the topic I want to tackle is the
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.520]   following provocative question, is ambition worth it? Now let me
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160]   give a disclaimer before I set up this discussion. The
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.440]   disclaimer is this is not a topic for which I have polished
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.680]   evolved thoughts that I am now going to convey to you. It's
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.360]   instead a topic that I have found interesting off and on and
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.040]   particularly recently I've been thinking about. So this morning,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.320]   I just jotted down some thoughts. So what this is what
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   you're going to hear today is me thinking out loud, not
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.260]   delivering well thought through conclusions. So this this should
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.320]   be fun, you know, buckle up for that. So what made me start
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.600]   thinking about ambition recently, there has been
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.440]   recently, as there happens off and on, it feels like over the
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.680]   last couple of years, a big collection of various essays and
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.520]   articles that have come out that are all taking a negative stance
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.080]   against the idea of ambition. People often send these to me
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.360]   and so I encounter them quite often. I'm cited in some of
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.240]   these. What's interesting is sometimes I'm cited as the
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.760]   villain and sometimes I'm cited as the non villain depending on
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.720]   how you think about me or what part of my writing you're
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.360]   actually citing. So these come to me because they often they
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000]   often cite me but it got me thinking recently about this
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.640]   topic of ambition. So if you look at these what I call
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.520]   anti-ambition essays, there's really two pieces to them.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.240]   There's the piece which is personal and interesting and
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.960]   compelling, which is often people talking about their own
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.680]   struggles with ambition, and the difficulty they have with it.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080]   And the attempts they're making to perhaps disentangle their
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   life from this ambition. And then there's a maybe the
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.560]   explanatory part that's saying why is ambition something that
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040]   is so popular? Why was I as the person writing this essay so
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.920]   entangled in ambition? And in some sense, that's less
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   interesting to me because you just see whatever frame that
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720]   person's cultural context lies within will just give them that
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.520]   answer. So if you read anti-ambition essays coming from
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.340]   let's say a substack writer who lives in Brooklyn, they're going
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.580]   to look around their cultural world and say, well, ambition
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.100]   is, it's from capitalism. Let's have like an economic
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.540]   materialist approach to this where we say if we can just get
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.740]   rid of capitalism, we can get rid of these sort of disordered
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.020]   affectations, these disordered compulsions towards
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.900]   accomplishment. Whereas if you read an anti-ambition essay,
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.500]   let's say from someone who lives in Montana, and is really in
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.660]   to bow hunting or Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the frame there
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.300]   might be a much more Thoreauian type frame about simplicity and
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.820]   focusing on things that really matter and getting clutter out
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.740]   of your life. So it really just depends. So I don't care about
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.220]   the explanation, but I care about the phenomenon of these
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.980]   essays, once again, becoming something that we read quite a
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.660]   bit about. So I want to jump into this and try to actually
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.940]   tackle this. So let's define ambition, number one, the drive
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.060]   to do things of increasing impact. So it's that drive to do
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.580]   things that are notable that have impact that are rewarded or
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.980]   remunerative, depending on what your metrics are, but generally
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.020]   that drive, and it's often insatiable. So if you hit one
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.540]   level, then that next level begins to be appealing. And what
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.700]   I want to try to do here is go over the pros and cons of
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.380]   ambition. So let's get into that. Let's start with the cons.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.540]   What's what's the issue with ambition? Number one, it leads
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.860]   or it can lead to burnout. We talk about burnout often on this
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.300]   show. And if we're talking in particular about professional
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.060]   burnout for people who do computer screen and email type
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.340]   jobs, there's really two big sources of burnout that people
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.460]   suffer from one is chronic overload. I talked about this,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.700]   for example, in my writing and my core ideas video on slow
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.340]   productivity. But if you have more on your plate consistently
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.860]   than you can even imagine accomplishing just too much on
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.140]   your plate, that can be quite distressing, it can short
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.220]   circuit the planning parts of your circuits, it can lead to an
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.580]   overhead spiral where you spend more time tending to all of
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.780]   these pending tasks than actually executing them recipe
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.820]   for burnout. The other main source of burnout among this
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.100]   particular context is when you spend too much time in a high
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.660]   arousal emotional state, so high stress state, high anxiety
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.260]   state. So so you know, your work is such that there's crises
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.620]   happening that keeps you at a at a high level of alertness, you
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.380]   can basically just burn out those systems as too much
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.780]   cortisol in your system, your mind gives gives up on it,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.940]   burnout can happen as well. Ambition can amplify both those
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.780]   issues. Because if you're ambitious, you are putting more
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.100]   and more stuff on your plate probably. Because you see these
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.460]   opportunities, you want to keep moving, you want to get after
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.940]   it. So chronic overload is a real hazard. Also, if you're
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.260]   ambitious, that means you're taking on responsibility and
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.020]   making moves that are more likely to expose yourself to
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.740]   those high arousal states. So I'm going to start my own
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940]   business, we're going to build this thing big, that's going to
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.900]   set you up for a lot of situations where there's a
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.220]   crisis with your business, you can't get the funding together,
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.900]   you're not going to make payroll, it's going to set you
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.140]   up for a lot of situations where you might have that consistent
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.980]   stress. So ambition can make it more likely that you burn out.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.700]   It amplifies our human instinct to compare, compare to other
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.620]   people. Now we all do this. I mean, regardless of your
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.820]   ambition or not, you look on Instagram, you see this, you get
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.820]   a little bit jealous. But when you are ambitious, it can become
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.940]   close to intolerable when you see the success you want that
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.460]   you're not getting. And I want to say I'm speaking from some
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   experience here. I am, I have ambition. It is a an odd
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.900]   mistress of mine that has both given and taken away. But I
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.700]   felt this amplification of comparison issue, it's almost
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.460]   weird how it works. It's like your brain is being taken over
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.660]   by someone else. Like here's something that I have periodic
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.140]   just to make this personal, I have periodic bouts of this,
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.540]   where I'll go through a period where I will feel bad about my
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.820]   status as a writer. Like, man, I just I didn't, I didn't hit
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.900]   where I want to get. Now by some standards, that's
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.380]   preposterous. Like I'm a successful writer, I have
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.020]   multiple books, I think four books at this point that are
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.220]   healthily into the six figures with sales, so I can
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.620]   consistently sell six figure books. I have a seven figure or
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.100]   a seven figure sale number book, relatively well known, done
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.460]   well financially with the books, I've made impact on
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.540]   culture, I've introduced new ideas into the vernacular. Like
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.700]   I am a successful writer by most standards, but then I'll
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.140]   say, but here's what I'm not. I've never had a book where
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.300]   right out of the gate, it is on the New York Times bestseller
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.900]   list for a while. Notice how I'm subtly shifting the goal
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.660]   post, my last two books have been New York Times
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.180]   bestseller, so my mind shifts it. You've never had a book
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.700]   that stays on the list. I've never had one of those books
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.180]   where it's just on that Amazon chart top 10 for six months
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.580]   when it comes out. Now we're talking about in my space,
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.940]   there's like five people who do that. But my mind will say,
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.660]   why aren't you one of those five? And then I'll come back
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.220]   to earth and be like, Oh, that's crazy. I feel great
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.980]   about what I'm doing, but I'll have those bouts. And I point
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.260]   out that personal example, just to talk about the way that
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.700]   ambition can rewire your mind in these ways that are
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.220]   malformed. As far as the outside world is concerned, that
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.060]   is crazy talk. But it'll hit you hard. Another issue with
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.460]   ambition is that it can keep you from other things that
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.940]   are important in your life if you're not careful. This is
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.220]   often one of the big points that's hit when you read the
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.140]   modern anti-ambition essays is that, you know, if you're
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.940]   all in on I am going to start the next Uber, you're not
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.380]   spending time with your kids, you're not spending time
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.100]   out in nature, your mind is probably always moving,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.220]   you're probably not very involved in your community and
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.700]   becoming a leader and sacrificing time and energy on
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.060]   behalf of people you care about, you're doing this one
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.180]   thing. So this is a real danger of ambition, it's easy
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.740]   to fall there to get very out of balance in your life.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.780]   This is why when I talk about the deep life and my bucket
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.940]   system for the deep life, we have these various aspects,
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.300]   you should focus on to try to keep that balance. And the
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.700]   final thing about ambition, the piece we don't talk about
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.860]   even when we encourage people to follow their dreams or do
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.180]   whatever they want to do is that you probably won't
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.540]   succeed. So the things that we are ambitious about are
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.980]   very hard. That's what makes them a target of ambition.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.540]   Most people won't succeed. So you go to a really good
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.940]   school, you worked really hard to get there. You take an
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.260]   an elite job, like I'm going to be a writer, going to move
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.620]   to New York, I'm going to be a writer, maybe I'll be the
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.620]   next Joan Didion, and most people won't be. And so 10
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.260]   years later, you're writing essays about, well, ambition
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.700]   is stupid anyways. Right? So it's hard, man. It's hard.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.460]   Most people don't get anywhere close to where they're
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.140]   going. There are also pros of ambition. So let's lay out
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.380]   the other side of this. So first of all, the pursuit of
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.420]   big goals is life affirming. I mean, this is the one thing
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.100]   I don't think the anti-ambition people acknowledge
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.180]   enough is that there are few results that are better
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.620]   understood in human psychology than if you take away
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.860]   people's sense of efficacy, take away their sense of
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.860]   here's something you're in charge of that's important
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.580]   that you're working on. They will just wither. There's
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.980]   almost nothing worth you can do to a human than put them
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.900]   in a situation where they can't do anything. There's
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.980]   nothing I'm working towards, there's nothing I'm taking
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.260]   care of, there's no challenges I'm facing. That makes
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.940]   humans miserable. They need that and they need
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.900]   sociality. You take away either of those two things,
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.780]   and it's a problem. So there is something life
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.660]   affirming going after something that's important or
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.780]   ambitious, it gives a focus your energy, the human
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.820]   brain does not want to do nothing. For very brief
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.780]   periods, it gets uncomfortable with doing nothing.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.140]   Also, accomplishment does make people feel good.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.980]   Again, the anti-ambition essays tend to downplay this,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.220]   but actually, it feels good to accomplish something.
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.100]   There's like the burst of chemicals in the moment.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.100]   Yes, that goes away, you're not going to have that,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.180]   that opioid style high permanently. But there is a
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.460]   background hum of confidence and satisfaction that
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.820]   does come from accomplishment. And I think that
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.900]   is worth acknowledging. If you're doing something at
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.100]   a high level, and you're recognized for it, you get
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.580]   a steady state sense of pride, of self worth, you
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.420]   have more confidence, it feels good. So it's not all
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.180]   invented, right? So it's not all just constructed as
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.460]   part of a conspiracy to help certain groups exploit
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.100]   others, there are real benefits that you get there.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.500]   And of course, society needs at least some people to
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.420]   be ambitious. That's what moves forward whole
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   technologies and industries. I mean, you take
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.900]   someone like Elon Musk. And when he is discussed in
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.740]   sort of elite cultural circles, everyone's just
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.660]   focusing on, does he believe the right things? Does
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.060]   he talk about things properly? Is he on our team?
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.500]   Is he on the other people's team? And I say, I don't
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.100]   know, I don't really care about that. He's kind of
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.820]   a weird guy. Yeah, I think we all kind of
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.220]   acknowledge that. But he single handedly made
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.300]   basically every automaker in the country have a
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.060]   serious electric car strategy. He single handedly
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.700]   reduced the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 10.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.420]   That's crazy ambition. I don't want to live Elon
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.140]   Musk life. It's brutal. But I'm glad there's people
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.340]   living Elon Musk's life because we have a cool
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.700]   electric cars now. And you can do this again and
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.900]   again with medicine and science with the
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.340]   practitioners there. We wouldn't have relativity
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.180]   if it's not for the fierce ambition of Einstein.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.580]   His whole family broke apart about this. His hair
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.740]   went white. Einstein's hair went white at a younger
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.900]   age than mine from the stress of trying to make
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.980]   these theories come together. His family life got
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.020]   terrible because of this. His health faltered
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.220]   because of this. I wouldn't want to do it. But
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.180]   relativity was absolutely foundational for
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.940]   understanding the modern world. So we also need
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.780]   ambition in the world, even if not everyone is
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.140]   doing it. All right. So we have pros and cons. So
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.260]   we get to the conclusion that all right. So who
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260]   wins? If the question is, is ambition worth it? We
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.180]   have two possible answers here. A, no, it's just
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.500]   an invention. It's a cultural construct that is
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.980]   exploitative of you. Stop it. Focus on just being
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.340]   present. Do less. And we'll just get rid of
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.540]   capitalism or whatever, or move to Montana and
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.900]   we'll be okay. The other answer is no, no, it's
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.700]   critical to feeling good. It's critical to self
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.380]   affirmation. It's critical to the society growing.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.340]   So what answer is right? I'm going to say neither.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.900]   And I'm going to say both. Because this is where
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.460]   I'm beginning to fall on this issue. And beginning
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.140]   is the key word here. I do not have a
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.060]   comprehensive take on this yet. But where I'm
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.140]   beginning to fall on this issue is that ambition
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:41.740]   is novelistic. It's novelistic in its scope and
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.820]   impact. When I say novelistic, I mean, messy and
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.980]   human and tragic and inspiring all at the same
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.820]   time. I think ambition gets to core
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.500]   contradictions in the human experience. We're
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.980]   miserable when it's removed from our life. But as
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.140]   we pursue it, it takes out of our life other
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.860]   things that we need to not be miserable. And
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.060]   there's tragedy in that. But there's also great
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.620]   inspiration in that. That's why I say it's
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.940]   novelistic. It's not something that we look at
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.300]   through an economic lens. It's not something that
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.060]   we necessarily look through a philosophic lens.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.220]   It is messy. And it's very human. And just like
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.340]   when you read a deep novel, a deep, good piece of
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.900]   literature, you're able to actually revel in the
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.060]   complexity because that's part of what you try to
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.260]   get out of a good novel. We need that mindset, I
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.180]   believe, when we're thinking about ambition. Now,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.300]   I think there's probably an evolutionary
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.420]   explanation we could put behind this messiness. I
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.260]   never hesitate to throw in some ill-conceived,
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.420]   ill-thought-through pop evolutionary psychology.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.660]   So let's do that real quick. Probably if you
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.300]   really were going to pull back the covers here,
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.180]   here's what you're going to find. In the
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.980]   Paleolithic, you have humans living tribally. We
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.540]   evolved a strong drive to be a respected member of
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.100]   our tribe that is critical to survival and passing
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.900]   on your genes. We know this is true in part
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.100]   because nothing makes us feel more immediate,
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.700]   uncontrolled, positive feelings than when we
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.620]   encounter a story of someone sacrificing on
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.860]   behalf of their tribe. It just hits us at a core,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.980]   like, "Yes, that is right. Look at this person who
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.900]   stood up and took the arrows on behalf of his or
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.620]   her people." That instinctively feels well, and
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.700]   nothing makes us feel more uncomfortable and
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.580]   squirrely and weasely than hearing a story of
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:39.260]   someone who betrays their tribe or is weak or
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.500]   cowardly. Those are deep instincts. Deep
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.660]   instincts mean deep evolutionary paths. This
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.940]   thing has evolved. The issue, of course, is the
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.380]   Paleolithic gave way to the Neolithic, and
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.580]   suddenly we had cities and city-states.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.940]   And eventually nations. And so now we have this
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.020]   drive to be respected and be a leader, except for
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.620]   the people in our immediate surroundings are no
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.740]   longer 15 people that we have lived with
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.820]   intergenerationally for 15 generations. It's 15,000
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.460]   people in a city-state. And that gave rise to this
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.060]   new type of Neolithic ambition, which we weren't
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.580]   evolved for. It is the evolved instinct to be a
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.980]   leader in the tribe applied to a much bigger
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.140]   context, and that's what gives you suddenly
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.500]   political ambitions. You have the pharaohs. It's
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.420]   what gives us intellectual ambition. You get
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.860]   Aristotle, you get Socrates, and what gives us
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.460]   these theological ambitions. You get Siddhartha,
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.180]   you get Jesus Christ, you get people who are
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.940]   trying to think through religious thoughts that
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.580]   are going to impact the entire world. This is a
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.460]   parochial instinct applied on a scale that was
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.260]   never evolved for. And so I don't know if this is
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.540]   true, but I would wager it is that tension between
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.620]   an instinct that was evolved to make sense among
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.860]   20 people, applied to a world of 6 billion that we
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.180]   now can communicate with and see and have an
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.140]   audience amongst, that creates this weird tension
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.260]   that we feel in our life, where this ambition to
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.100]   keep going farther, and yet that ambition is
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.900]   taking us away from the things that are important
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.460]   to us, like being with our family and with our
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.260]   community. And that's because there was a time
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.860]   when that was all the same thing. That time was
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.060]   100,000 years ago. I don't know if that's true,
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.100]   but I think that's one way of trying to get at
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.700]   this fundamental, novelistic, tragic,
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.740]   inspirational tug-of-war that is at the core of
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.500]   so many people's life, which is the fight over
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.020]   ambition. So I don't have a nice, clean story to
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.660]   give you. I don't have a nice, clean answer. This
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.140]   is what you should do. Do these three steps, put
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.700]   this card on your Trello board, and use a
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.220]   time-block planner. Boom, you're good with
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.100]   ambition. I don't know the answer here yet, but
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.660]   I'm increasingly feeling that the answer is going
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.220]   to evolve, cutting each other some slack, and
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.020]   seeing ambition as this complicated, wonderful,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.740]   terrible, interesting piece of the human
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.660]   condition, and not just a simple football we can
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.820]   kick back and forth. It's good, it's bad, that
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.980]   team likes it, this team doesn't. Something
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.940]   interesting going on here, and we should be okay
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.260]   with that nuance. So that is my, those are my
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.020]   thoughts on ambition.
