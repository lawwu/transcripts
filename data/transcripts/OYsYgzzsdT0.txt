[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   This is not a nice Islamic fatherly regime.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Clear signs of fascism.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.920]   Clear signs of the state's control
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680]   and pay any price to stay in power.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.080]   - So even violence.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.400]   - Extreme violence.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.000]   - The following is a conversation with Abbas Aminat,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100]   a historian at Yale University,
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800]   specializing in the modern history of Iran.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.000]   My love and my heart goes out to the Iranian people
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.560]   in their current struggle for freedom.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.660]   I hope that this conversation helps folks who listen
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.660]   understand the nature and the importance of this struggle.
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.820]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.080]   in the description.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.880]   And now, dear friends, here's Abbas Aminat.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.940]   Let's start with the current situation in Iran.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420]   On September 16th, protests broke out in Tehran
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.900]   and quickly spread over the death
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.860]   of a 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.740]   Eyewitnesses saw her beaten to death
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.580]   by the morality police.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.820]   This is a heavy topic, but it's a really important topic.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.540]   Can you explain what happened?
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.100]   - The protests are now in their sixth week.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.080]   The death of that young woman, a Kurd,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.040]   who was visiting Tehran as a tourist,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   sparked something very deep
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.560]   that particularly concerned the younger generations.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.480]   That is what you would call the equivalent
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.600]   of the Z generation in this country.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   They call themselves Dahiy-e Hashdadi in Persian
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.560]   because Iran follows the solar calendar of its own.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.680]   It's an ancient solar calendar.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.400]   And the time that they were born,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.880]   they were in the 1380s.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.320]   That's what they called themselves, Hashdadi.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.360]   '80s, Hashdad for the '80s.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.560]   Well, the circumstances that surrounds
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.160]   the unfortunate death of this young,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   beautiful Kurdish woman is really tragic.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640]   She was arrested by what is referred to
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.520]   as the morality police, morality patrol,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.560]   called the Gashd-e-Ershad,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   a guidance police, that is.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.280]   Presumably, there were two women fully clad,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.800]   that is, officers serving on that force,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.200]   and two men.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.840]   And nobody exactly knows what had happened.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   She had been beaten up,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.520]   and apparently there was no sign
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.440]   of any wrongdoing on her side.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.640]   She was fully covered.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.000]   It seems that there was some altercation in the process.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   And the outcome was that she was unconscious,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880]   not necessarily when she was arrested,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   but in the course of the detention,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   when they take them to a center,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.300]   presumably to re-educate them.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.200]   And she apparently collapsed,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.080]   and maybe my sense is that she must have had
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.800]   some kind of a problem because of the skull being broken
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.320]   or something had happened.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.980]   And she died in the hospital the next day.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.560]   And that, through the social media,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.480]   was widely spread throughout Iran.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.400]   And almost the next day, surprisingly,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   you could see this outburst of sympathy for her.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.080]   People are in the streets weeping
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.240]   because she was seen as such an innocent young woman,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   22 years old.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   And the family, the mother and the father,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.520]   also mourning for her.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.240]   And being a Kurd visiting Tehran,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.720]   this all added up to really turn her
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.320]   into some kind of a martyr of this cause.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.600]   And that's what it is.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.480]   And her picture,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.080]   graphics that were artistically produced
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.060]   based on her portrait,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.800]   has now dominated basically as the symbol
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.440]   of this protest movement.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.600]   And the protest movement goes on.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.000]   Everybody was thinking,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   or at least the authorities were thinking,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.220]   that it's going to die out in a matter of a few days.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.520]   But it became more intense,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.460]   first in the streets of Tehran by young women,
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.720]   mostly probably between, I would say, 17, 18, teenagers
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.960]   to 22, 23, or thereabout,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.280]   and then to university campuses all around the country,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.880]   and then even to high schools.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.720]   And that also made it a very remarkable protest movement
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.600]   because, first of all, it involves the youth
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.760]   and not necessarily the older generations.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.980]   You see them around, but not as many.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.200]   Also, you see men and women together,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.440]   young girls and boys,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.120]   and they are adamant,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   they are desperate in the sense of the tone of their protest,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.240]   and they are extremely courageous
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.100]   because they stand against the security forces
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   that were immediately sent off to the streets,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.000]   and in full gear, that is.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.160]   - So what are the currents of pain, emotion?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.240]   What is this turmoil that rose to the surface
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.600]   that resulted in these big protests?
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   What are the different feelings, ideas
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.240]   that came to the surface here
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   that resulted in such quick scaling of this protest?
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   - Well, if you listen to the main slogan,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.680]   which is the message of this movement,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.200]   it's called Women, Life, Freedom.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.760]   Zan, Zendegi, Azadi,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   which is a translation of actually the Kurdish equivalent,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.280]   which is close to Persian being in the European language,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.760]   and it's apparently initiated first
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.960]   in the Syrian Kurdistan,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.960]   where they were fighting against the Islamic Daesh forces
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   because they were attacking the Yazidis there,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   and the women being enslaved.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   But the message, as it moved,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.240]   well, historians are interested in this kind of trends,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.000]   so it just moved to Kurdistan and from Kurdistan,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.480]   now being the message of this movement,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.560]   reflects pretty much, sums up
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.760]   what this movement is all about.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.520]   Women in the forefront,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.120]   because of all the, one might say, discriminations,
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.640]   the treatment, the humiliation,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.420]   that this younger generation feels,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.300]   well, not only the younger generations,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.720]   but most of the Iranian secular middle classes
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.720]   since 1979, basically, for the past 43 years.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.440]   And they would think that these all basically symbolized
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   or represented by the wearing,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   the mandatory wearing of the hijab,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.560]   which is at the core of this protest.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.960]   You see the young women,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.640]   if you look at many of these clips
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   that comes through in the past six weeks,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.840]   women in streets take off their mandatory scarves,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.640]   which is a young shawl,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.920]   or some kind of a head covering, that's all,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.560]   and they throw it into the bonfire
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.460]   in the middle of the street,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.520]   and they dance around it, and slogans.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.640]   So there is a sense of complete rejection
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.960]   of what this regime for 42 years, 43 years,
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.880]   have been imposing on women.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.040]   It's not, as it's sometimes been portrayed,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   a movement against hijab through and through,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.080]   but it basically says there has to be a choice
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.040]   for those who want to wear hijab
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.880]   and those who want to remain without hijab.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.520]   - Yeah, the hijab is a symbol of something much deeper.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.980]   - Much deeper, and actually, before we get into that,
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.520]   it's interesting to note that in many of these demonstrations
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.260]   we see in the university campuses or in the streets,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.040]   you see women with hijab, young women with hijab,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.800]   or next to those who have to remove their hijab,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.600]   and they're together basically protesting.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   That's the most interesting feature of these demonstrations,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.700]   and then men and women together against the segregation
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.960]   that the regime has imposed upon them all these years.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Now, in terms of what it represents, as I pointed out,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.200]   one is the question of the whole series of,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   one might say, civil and legal discriminations against women.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.600]   You are considered as a kind of a second-class citizen.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.820]   You depend on your men.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.820]   There's a kind of a patriarchy that has been institutionalized
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.360]   in the Islamic Republic in a very profound fashion,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   and that means that probably in matters of divorce,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.480]   marriage and divorce, in matters of custody
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.160]   of your children, in matter of inheritance,
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.640]   in matter of freedom of movement,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.540]   you depend on your husband, your father, your brother,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   a male member of your family, your child, your son,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.960]   could be the case, and because of that,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   obviously a younger generation who is so well-informed
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.560]   through social media, knows about the world
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   as much as an American does, American kid does,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.800]   and probably sometimes more.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.160]   They're very, very curious.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.440]   It's from what I hear, or sometimes that I met
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.420]   a few of them outside Iran.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.680]   You'll see that Hadi, this new generation
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.600]   is completely different from what the Islamic Republic
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.520]   wanted to create in its social engineering.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.460]   It's basically the failure of 43 years
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.040]   of the Islamic Republic's acts of imposition
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   of a certain so-called Islamic values on women.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.600]   Then it's a matter of education.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.440]   You would see that there is segregation in the schools.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.320]   One of the issues that now, right now,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.480]   is at the heart of this demonstration
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.740]   is that self-services in many of the campuses
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.000]   of the Iranian universities are segregated,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.140]   male and female, to different rooms, to different halls.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.460]   Now they are breaking through the walls
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.420]   virtually everywhere and sit together
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   in order to basically resist the authorities
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.340]   who wants to impose segregation.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.340]   In matters of appearance in the public,
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.340]   of course it may seem to us as kind of trivial
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.280]   and secondary, but appearance is important.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.640]   Clothing is important.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.180]   How you would imagine yourself is important.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.940]   They don't want to be seen in the way
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.580]   that the authorities would like to impose upon them
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.080]   as this kind of an idea of a chaste Islamic woman
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.920]   who is fully covered and is fully protected.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.580]   The idea of a male member of the family
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.720]   protects the female.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.560]   That is what you would see at the heart of this rebellion.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.720]   And of course, that goes with everything else.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.340]   The second part of this message, the idea of life,
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.320]   basically means, if you like to use the American equivalent
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.280]   of this, the pursuit of the happiness.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.400]   That's what they want.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.520]   They want fun.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.100]   They want music.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.360]   They want dancing.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.960]   They want to be free in the street.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.400]   They want to have boyfriends.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.880]   And live freely.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.680]   And don't be constantly looked by the big brother
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   to tell them what to do and not to do or not to do.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.440]   So that is, that they share virtually
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.240]   with the entire Iranian society as a whole.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.320]   Although the older generations, that's a big puzzle.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   What you would see, the older generation don't,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.400]   so far at least, don't take part as extensively
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.100]   as one might imagine.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.240]   And this is a variety of reasons.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.160]   Perhaps we can get to that later on, if you like.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.420]   But as far as this younger generation, they don't care.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.440]   They don't listen even as much to their parents
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.580]   as the older generations did.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.840]   So one might say even the nature of the relationship
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   between the parents and the youth has changed.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.480]   It's not the concept of again a patriarchy.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.480]   That a father or even a mother would tell the daughter
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.960]   or son what to do.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.760]   That's basically they have to negotiate.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.520]   - It's fundamentally a rejection of the power of authority.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.960]   Parents, government.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.800]   - Yes.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   - That every person can decide their own fate.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.440]   And there's no lessening of value of the wisdom
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.920]   of old age and old institutions.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.840]   - Precisely, that's what it is.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.800]   And they are surprisingly aware
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.040]   that where they are as a generation.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   So it's a sense of pride as we are different
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.560]   from the older generation.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.840]   From your parents who compromised and lived
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.680]   with the restrictions that the Islamic regime put on you.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   Your grandparents who was the generation
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.440]   that actually involved in the revolution of '79.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.700]   The parents which were the middle generation.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.360]   And these are the third generation
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.960]   after the revolution of 1979.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.320]   And therefore they differentiate themselves
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.720]   in terms of their identity from the older generation.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   So that's the life part of it.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.000]   I mean one can go more and more.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.240]   They want to access.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.880]   And they see on social media what happens
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.840]   in the rest of the world.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.360]   They're well aware.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.360]   They're much better digitally skilled
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.240]   than my generation for instance.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.600]   And they know about all the personalities.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   They know about all the celebrities.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.800]   They know about all the trends that goes on outside Iran.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.400]   So that's a second part of this message.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.440]   And then of course the third part is the word azadi.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.640]   Meaning freedom or liberty.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   Which is this long standing demand of the Iranians
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.600]   I would say for the whole century.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.840]   Ever since the constitutional revolution of 1906.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.280]   Iran has witnessed this problem of authorities
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.200]   that usually emerged at the end of a revolution
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   to basically impose its own image on the population,
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.880]   on the youth.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.360]   And create authoritarian regimes.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.720]   Of which over the course of time I would say
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.080]   that the Islamic Republic is the worst.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   In the sense that its intrusion is not only
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.720]   in the political sense.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.440]   In for instance banning the freedom of speech.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   You know meddling with the elections.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.760]   Banning political parties.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.320]   All kinds of that things which are the political
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.640]   or civil freedoms.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.320]   But its intrusion into the personal life of the individual.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.040]   Which is the worst kind in a sense as you would see
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.800]   that there is always an authority that basically
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.140]   dominates your life or monitors your life.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.140]   So and they do it in a kind of a very consistent fashion
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.140]   which makes this idea of freedom so important
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.060]   as part of the message of this new movement.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.580]   You would see that in today's Iran
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.300]   there are no independent political parties.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   There is very little probably freedom of the press.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.340]   I wouldn't say that it's entirely gone.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.840]   But it's fairly limited.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.340]   There's enormous amount of propaganda machine
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.340]   which dominates the entire radio and TV system in Iran.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's completely in the hands of the government.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.520]   And of course you would see this variety of other tools
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   for trying to indoctrinate Iranian population
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.420]   across the board.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.180]   So that's another sign of this kind of a sense
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   of being totally left out.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:27.160]   You're not belonging to what's going on
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.660]   in terms of power, empowerment and disempowerment.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.220]   So that's the situation as far as the idea
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.160]   of a freedom is concerned.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.660]   And there's three somewhat miraculously
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.160]   and perhaps unintentionally,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   the three parts of this message complement each other.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.680]   Because perhaps for the first time we see
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   that women are in the forefront of a movement.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.340]   I hesitate to say revolution
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.780]   because I'm not particularly happy with revolutions.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.420]   Revolutions worldwide in Iran have always been so miserable
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.140]   in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.900]   not to use the word revolution again.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.540]   So that's where it stands now.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.680]   And the regime was thinking that well, these are kids,
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.020]   they're going to go away.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.540]   And then of course they're completely conspiratorial
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.700]   in their thinking.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:33.140]   They constantly think that these are all the instigations
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.620]   and provocations of foreign powers.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.140]   These are the great Satan, the United States,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.820]   this is Israel, or these are the,
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.340]   it's actually the Supreme Leader says in so many words.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   His only response so far that he had in the past six weeks
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.700]   with regard to this demonstrations is that
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.140]   these are the children of the Sabaq,
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.460]   Sabaq being the security forces of the Shah's time.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.460]   That's 43 years later, he claims that the children,
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:11.100]   16, 17 years, 20 years old, kids in the street
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.100]   are the grandchildren or children of some imaginary
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.580]   survival of the Shah's security force.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.580]   - So there's, the idea is that these protests are internal
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.740]   and external saboteurs.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.860]   So people trying to sabotage the government.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.700]   - Yes.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.500]   And they are misled.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.340]   - Misled.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.260]   - As far as they can go.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.220]   - And then there's the great Satan, United States,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.700]   and other places are controlling,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.780]   sort of either controlling the narrative,
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.780]   feeding propaganda, or literally sending people to instigate.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.300]   - I don't think even they have that kind of imagination
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.180]   precise to say what you have said.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   - Yeah.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.140]   - They would say that they're controlling the narrative.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.220]   They basically say, no, these are agents
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.260]   of the foreign powers.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.620]   And their families are all sold out
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.340]   and they are basically lost their loyalties
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.580]   to the great Islamic Republic.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:21.100]   And therefore, they can be treated so brutally,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.940]   they can be suppressed so brutally.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.180]   Which I haven't actually said what they are doing
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.820]   because I thought perhaps first we should talk about
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.900]   who these kids are in the streets
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.900]   before we move on about the response of the government.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.900]   But one major factor which seems to add to the anxiety
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:44.860]   of, well, the regime is extremely anxious now
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.100]   because they are in a position,
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.780]   this shows that they don't have the lack of confidence
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.940]   in a sense, that they would see them reacting
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.260]   in a very forceful way.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.220]   Because basically they don't seem to have
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.060]   that kind of confidence to allow this message
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.220]   or the movement to be aired.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.900]   But the one element which corresponds to that
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.820]   is that there is a expatriate population
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.180]   of Iranians worldwide.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.140]   There are probably now, according to some estimates,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.820]   close to four million, even more, Iranians abroad.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.020]   And they're all over the world,
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.860]   from Australia and New Zealand, Japan,
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.860]   Western Europe, Turkey, and United States and Canada.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.900]   So just to give you one example,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.900]   last Saturday there was a mass demonstrations in Berlin
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.860]   by the Iranians from Germany and all over Europe,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.300]   Western Europe.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.820]   And it was at least, I think probably
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.500]   the conservative estimate was about 100,000.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.580]   So 100,000 Iranians showed up in Berlin
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.580]   demonstrating against the treatment of the women in Iran
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.960]   or the movement in Iran.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.740]   The government thinks obviously this must have been
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.940]   some instigation by foreign powers
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.320]   and they want to destroy the Islamic Republic.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.340]   And not only that, but their propaganda
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.380]   is kind of ridiculous.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.320]   Because I listened actually to how they portrayed it
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.400]   in the newspapers.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.200]   I listened to the Iranian news,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.780]   that is officially controlled, government-controlled news.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.280]   And in the papers, much of the papers
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.820]   that are in the control of the government.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.820]   One of them, or actually the major news program
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.260]   portrayed the demonstrations that 10,000 people
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.260]   showed up in Berlin and protested against the rising prices
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:03.740]   or rising rates for gas and oil in Germany.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.760]   So that's how they mislead.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.900]   In a very rather stupid fashion,
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.900]   because probably 95%, if not 100% of the Iranians
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:18.660]   are listening to Persian-speaking media outside Iran.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   So there's a BBC Persian, there is Iran International,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.120]   there are at least five or six of them.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.240]   - That's probably really important to highlight
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   that Iran is a very modern and tech-savvy nation.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.560]   Not just the young people.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.040]   - Probably more than I feel sometimes
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.200]   when I compare myself to what they are doing.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   It's since 1979, the earlier years, for a decade or two,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.400]   they tried in a very crude fashion
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   to restrict access to media outside Iran.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.880]   Because this is all through dishes, okay?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   And satellite dishes are everywhere.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.680]   If you look at the buildings,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.000]   small towns and villages in Iran,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.040]   there's always a dish.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.600]   And they watch all kinds of things through this.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.400]   And particularly because of what's happening now,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   they listen to all the news broadcasts
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.900]   from all this media, and they're extremely active.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:36.400]   There are probably, some of them, even 24 hours,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.680]   or close, very extensive coverage
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.400]   of every clip that comes through.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.640]   So what the government is doing now, the Islamic Republic,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.920]   is that they restrict the entire internet.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.840]   - They shut down the internet.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.520]   - They shut down the internet,
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.440]   but they cannot afford shutting down the internet
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.760]   because much of the business, much of the everyday life,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.460]   much of the government affairs depends on the internet,
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.040]   like everywhere else.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   And Iran is extremely,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.240]   if I hear from many of the colleagues and friends,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.400]   it's like, in certain respects, it's like Sweden.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.200]   Where you go there, there's no more currency,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.400]   and for a very good reason,
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.320]   because there's so much inflation,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.160]   that the banknotes are worthless, in a sense.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.620]   So everything is through sweeping your card.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.160]   And that entire system is in a standstill
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   because people cannot buy food.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.200]   You go to the supermarket, that's how you would do it.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.400]   You order food to come to your house,
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.440]   which Iranians, at least the middle classes,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.560]   more prosperous middle classes, doing all the time.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.640]   So they deliver everything.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.560]   And because of the COVID, it became even more.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.000]   And they have to pay all through this system.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.400]   So what happens is that now they're estimating
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.200]   that every day, $50 million, the Iranian government
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.440]   or the Iranian economy is losing
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.240]   because of slowing the internet.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.840]   - Plus the frustration is growing
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   because you can't order food.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.800]   - Among other things.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   I mean, they are in touch with,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   WhatsApp, every Iranian, virtually every Iranian,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.360]   that has education, and education in the sense
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   that has gone through the high schools and universities,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.240]   knows how to use the WhatsApp.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.080]   - So there's a big middle class,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.520]   like you said, secular middle class in Iran.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.980]   And there, there's a lot of, at least, capacity for,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   if not revolution, then political, ideological turmoil.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:02.240]   - And a huge amount of hatred.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.360]   - So the hatred has grown.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   - Yes, hatred of the policies of the regime,
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.960]   of isolation, that's a huge point
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.040]   that you hear a great deal about.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.760]   We don't want to be isolated.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.320]   We don't want to be humiliated.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   Iran is not about this miserable regime
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.080]   that is ruling over us.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.480]   We have a great culture.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.840]   So there's a sense of pride in their own culture,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.480]   some of it Islamic, some of it pre-Islamic.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   So there's a huge sense of pride in that.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.080]   And they see that they cannot communicate
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.760]   with the outside world.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.760]   They want to travel abroad, which they do.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.040]   I mean, for one thing, the Iranian regime never actually,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.760]   for majority of the population, never puts restrictions.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.200]   It's not like, what is it, Soviet Union,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.560]   where you have to have, you used to have permission
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.440]   to move from one place to another.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:16.380]   And then, of course, the Islamic regime, since 1979,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.920]   basically chased away or destroyed the old middle class.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.160]   That's my generation, basically, or my parents' generation.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.960]   These are the secular middle class of the Pahlavi era,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.600]   in the hope that they can do this social engineering
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   and create this Islamic society of their own.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:41.380]   The bad news for them was that that didn't happen,
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.640]   and that memory persisted.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.240]   And the middle class that was created since past 40 years
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.980]   is much larger in size than what it was,
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.080]   because there was, of course, the demographic revolution.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.720]   That's the very, there's a very foundation of it,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.840]   is the demographic revolution.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.680]   Population in Iran, I've written an article about it,
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   actually, population in Iran,
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.240]   since the turn of the century, last century,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.840]   it's 20th century, population of Iran
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.060]   was about nine million or so.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.720]   It's now 83 million.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:26.520]   And that is, since 1979, the population was 35 million.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.640]   Between the past 40 years, it's basically doubled.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.580]   So it's 83 million.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.960]   Although, one of the great successes,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.640]   I don't want to bore you with the details
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.440]   about the demography, but it's important.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.960]   - Please, demographics is not boring.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.880]   - You will, you can see that the birth rate was very high.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.040]   Otherwise, you wouldn't have doubled your population
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.120]   in a matter of four decades.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.200]   But Iranians, because of the urban,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   shift to an urban population,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.800]   because of the growth of the middle class,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.540]   because of the education,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.360]   they basically, the pattern of the,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.960]   of growth, population growth, changed.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   Iran used to be 2.8 or 3% birth rate
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.160]   in around 1980s, I would say, 1970s, 1980s.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.000]   Now, it is 1.1.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.640]   And it's probably the most successful country
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.360]   in the Middle East, in terms of the population control.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   Despite the government's consistent attempt
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.080]   to try to encourage people to have more kids,
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.800]   middle class refuses to do that.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.720]   And this is middle class, not only anymore in the capital,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   but this is, when in smaller towns and cities,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.240]   places that used to be villages.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.280]   Now you look at them, they have a decent population,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.080]   50,000, 100,000, and they live an urban life,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.120]   and they don't want to be subjected
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.280]   to that old pattern of agrarian society
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.000]   when you had 10 children, or eight children.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.400]   And of course, it's much more advanced
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   in terms of health and medicine.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   So you don't lose children as they used to.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.880]   The antibiotics, there's always kids to survive,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.440]   and therefore, if you have 10 kids,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.080]   you're sick with 10 kids.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.220]   You don't end up with four as it used to be in the past.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.600]   Six of them would have died,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.120]   up to the age of five, actually.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   But now, because of that, you see that this urban population
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.680]   in the cities have completely different demands.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.840]   And of course, the education is important.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.600]   That's another area of how the social engineering
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.440]   of the Islamic Republic went away,
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.280]   because they were thinking that the growth
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.440]   of the population, the growth of the educated,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.800]   higher educated middle classes in their benefit,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.620]   or they could not even control it, in a sense.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.440]   Now, Iran, in my time, probably had,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:31.360]   in the 1970s, probably by the time of the revolution,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   had 10, 12 universities.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.120]   Now it has 56 universities all across the country,
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.160]   and there is something referred to
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.080]   as the Free University, Azad,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.360]   which has campuses all over the country.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.960]   It has 321 campuses all around Iran.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.840]   What does that mean?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.260]   In many respects, this youth that are brought up
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.540]   in these families, even in small towns,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.720]   in very traditional families,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.600]   in families that belong to that kind of a more religious,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   loyal to the clergy, or to the clerical classes,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.040]   their children can now move on, particularly women.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.760]   Because in my times, it would have been unheard of
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   that you would have a young woman of 18,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   or 17, 18, 19, from a traditional city,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.560]   such as, for instance, Yazd,
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.320]   or in Southeastern Iran,
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.720]   to move on elsewhere for education,
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.100]   as you do in this country.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.520]   Now, it's completely accepted
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.000]   that a woman wears hijab
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.400]   because she's forced to wear hijab,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.260]   to go to a university completely
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.720]   on the other side of the country.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.920]   And this movement of the population,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.240]   not only because of the universities,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.580]   but in general, if you now visit Iran,
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.720]   you hear accents, local accents,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.620]   provincial accents, all over the country.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:21.680]   That is a Azerbaijani-Turkish accent
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.480]   from the northwest of the country.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.280]   You can hear it in the first province in the south,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.060]   and vice versa.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.040]   So, and Kurdish, for instance.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.400]   Or even more marginal regions,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   such as Sistan province in the southeast of Iran,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.920]   which has been the subject of this recent massacre,
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.360]   when they actually attacked the population
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.200]   when demonstrating, and killed a fair number,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.620]   at least 60 people.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:54.040]   So, this movement of the population,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.800]   this creation of a larger middle class,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.920]   the better-educated middle class,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.160]   much better educated.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   Iran has 86% literacy,
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.180]   which I think probably, I haven't checked that,
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.620]   but probably is better than Turkey, even.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.920]   Is probably better than anywhere else in the Middle East.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.400]   - And it sounds like that's quickly increasing.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.920]   - Yes. - Because of the movement,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.000]   because of the growth of the education system,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.760]   that's-- - Precisely.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.020]   Iran has one million school teachers,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.920]   which may not seem as much if you're in the United States,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.560]   but it's a fairly big number, actually.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.280]   - Can you linger on the massacre?
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.120]   What happened there?
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   - Well, the Sistan province is a Baluch ethnicity,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.760]   of Baluch ethnicity.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.680]   Baluch is a particular ethnic group in southern Iran,
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   which is Sunni rather than Shi'i, majority.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.120]   - And we should say that most of Iran--
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.440]   - Is Shi'i. - Is Shi'i,
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.720]   and that's a branch of Islam.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.040]   - Shi'ism, yes.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.920]   - Let's maybe just briefly linger Shi'ism and Sunni.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.120]   What-- - What?
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.000]   - Just, let's not get into it.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.560]   - (laughs) Yeah, I don't want to.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.120]   - Let's do a one-sentence summary,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   and that maybe, which is what most of Iran is.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.120]   - Majority of the population of the Muslim world are Sunnis.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.600]   These are mainstream, if you like to call it that.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.160]   Actually, sunnah means that kind of a mainstream.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   - Can you actually linger on the Sunni, sunnah, Shi'a?
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   - Shi'a means a party,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.960]   means those that belongs to a party of Ali,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.480]   which goes back to the early Islamic history
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.960]   of seventh century.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.760]   - I mean, I'm almost lingering to the silly notion
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.400]   of pronunciation and stuff like that.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.360]   So, ah, ah means part, like what?
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.960]   What does the extra I at the end do?
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   - Shi'i means belonging to the Shi'i community.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.120]   Shi'a means a person of a Shi'a.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.960]   - That belongs to that community.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.440]   - If you say, "Are you a Shi'a?"
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.600]   Yes, I am a Shi'a.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.520]   - Yeah, and Shi'i is the community.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.840]   - Community, and in English, when it was Anglicized,
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.080]   it becomes Shi'ite.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.720]   So, if you say Shi'ite in today, it's perfectly acceptable.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.160]   And of course, I myself, in my writings,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.760]   I always switch between one and the other.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.920]   One of my books is always Shi'ite,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.960]   the other book's always Shi'.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.840]   And that hasn't been settled.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   But the Shi'i population is the smaller
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.560]   compared to the Sunni population in the world.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.400]   - In the world.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.220]   - In the world.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.760]   - But in Iran, it's the opposite.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.440]   - The Iran and Iraq, and possibly now Lebanon,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.000]   are the three countries who barely,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Iraq and Lebanon have barely majority Shi'i population.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.480]   Whereas Iran is a large Shi'i population
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.760]   due to its history of conversion to Shi'ism,
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.120]   that by itself is another story.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.080]   But in the sense that,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.520]   the way that historically it evolved,
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.160]   the center became more Shi'i,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   and the peripheries remained Sunni.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.020]   So you have communities of the Baluch in the southeast,
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:31.880]   you have the Kurds, a large portion of the Kurds are Sunnis,
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.040]   they have Shi'is as well,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   and they have the indigenous religion
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.180]   of their own, what's called Ahlul Haqq,
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.860]   which is the religion of indigenous to Kurdistan.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.400]   There are Turkmen in the northeast of Iran,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.120]   who are also Sunnis,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.520]   there are other communities in Khurasan region,
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.040]   in the peripheries of Afghanistan,
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.680]   they are also Sunnis.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.600]   And you have some Arab population,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.760]   Arab-speaking population in the Khuzestan province,
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.600]   in the southwest of Iran,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.920]   which is also, or across the Persian Gulf.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   - Is there a lot of conflict between these regions?
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   And also, if I blindfolded you,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.000]   and dropped you off in one of the regions,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   would you quickly recognize the region?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Like by the food, by the music, by the accents, by so on?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.200]   - Yeah, the answer to your lovely question,
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.120]   which I think, I hope it would have happened to me,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.300]   is that yes, you would see different cultures.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:35.440]   But different food, most important, different accents.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.600]   Or different languages, since they have dialects.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.560]   There's Baluch, different language altogether.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   But, or so for that matter, Kurdish,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.160]   which is closer to Persian,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.360]   because they're all Indo-European languages.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.520]   But Turkish, Azeri Turkish,
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.880]   which is probably closer to the Turkish of Turkey,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.240]   Republic of Turkey,
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.680]   or to the Republic of Azerbaijan in the north.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:04.340]   They're the same, basically.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.560]   Actually, if you would have looked,
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.720]   that's a fascinating picture,
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.000]   if you have looked at the, let's say even 19th century,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.200]   early 20th century, linguistic map of Iran,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.360]   you would have been amazed in the number of dialects,
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.080]   in the number of languages that have survived.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.280]   This is an ancient country, it's an ancient land.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.500]   And it's a lot of mountains all around it, or big deserts.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.100]   So there's a sense of isolation.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.800]   So you would say, here and there,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.040]   you see a different community that speaks differently.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.000]   - All ancient traditions and languages.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.680]   - Yeah, and because of the great number of invasions
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   that Iran witnessed over more than two and a half millennia,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:53.160]   of course, all kinds of cultures were introduced into Iran.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.080]   There are all ethnicities were introduced to Iran,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.640]   mostly coming from the northeast of Iran,
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   from the lowlands of Central Asia and beyond,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.620]   and continued into Iran proper.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.600]   So, but now, what has happened,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.720]   that's my point that I wanted to make.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:20.180]   Century of modernity, or modernization,
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.020]   has produced a national culture
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.660]   of great strength, in a sense, I would say.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:33.660]   I ended my book, the book on Iran, Iran in Modern History,
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.560]   basically saying that despite everything else
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.640]   that has created so much trouble for today's Iran,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   there is a sense of a cultural identity
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.100]   that is very strong.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.100]   And I think I can say with some confidence
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:59.580]   that despite this regional identities
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.260]   that are still there and they're great
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.820]   and they should be celebrated,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.140]   today, if you go to Kurdistan,
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:15.140]   or if you go to Cistan, they all can speak Persian.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.180]   They all have an education in Persian.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.900]   So they all basically are becoming part of,
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.960]   whether they like the regime in power or not,
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.340]   they have a sense of belonging to a culture
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.180]   and an identity with the center.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.940]   And of course, the idea of a center versus periphery
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.020]   in Iran is very old.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.040]   It goes back to ancient times,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.060]   because even the name of the country
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.860]   was the guarded domains of Iran.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.700]   This is the official name,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.180]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.540]   Namely, that it was recognized
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.540]   that this is not just one entity,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.620]   but it's a collection of entities--
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.660]   - Like the United States of America.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.780]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   But the United States of America,
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.020]   in a sense, you can say that it was a very successful,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.500]   well, it remains to be seen how successful--
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.900]   - To be continued.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.220]   - To be, that was basically invented, created,
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.920]   that you would have this sense of it.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.300]   In the case of an old nation,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.940]   which has been on the map of the world
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.980]   for 3,000 years, 2,500 years,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.380]   this is not an exaggeration.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.700]   I am not a nationalist per se,
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.580]   but if you look Persia on the map of the world
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.700]   in ancient times, it is still there as it is today.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.700]   Very few countries in the world are like that,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.180]   that they would have that kind of a continuity
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.500]   over a course of time.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.020]   And that's not without a reason,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   because there was this sense of a center versus periphery
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.660]   that had found, there's a huge amount of tension,
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.060]   but there is also a sense of belonging to something.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.780]   And state is very much at the center of it.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.780]   I mean, that's why the concept of a state matters
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.700]   for the creation, for the shaping of this culture.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.380]   What happened is therefore, you can see that today
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.340]   in answer to your point about traveling blindfolded,
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.340]   is that you would be surprised to see
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.380]   how much people share
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.680]   in terms of, I just give you one anecdote.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.620]   In 1968, I believe, must have been,
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.020]   I traveled to Azerbaijan.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.540]   I used to travel and actually photograph.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.820]   - Not blindfolded.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.780]   - No. (laughs)
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.620]   - Mostly.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:54.340]   - Well, yeah, not blindfolded, no, no, not blindfolded.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:58.020]   So I went to a bazaar in the city of Khoyi,
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.740]   which is in the northwestern Iran.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:07.080]   On the border with what is today the Republic of Turkey.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.300]   And I went to the bazaar and I was interested
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.820]   in the kind of leather work that they produce.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.900]   So I tried to buy some stuff and I was surprised to see
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.720]   that how few people knew Persian.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.100]   So they could not communicate in Persian with you.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.160]   Either they have to ask somebody from some other store
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.540]   to come and translate for you.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.980]   This is 1968.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.620]   - 1968, so even though it's the official language--
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.980]   - Was Persian.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.140]   - Of the country, there's still--
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:42.980]   - Yeah.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.100]   - So what are they teaching school?
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.940]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.860]   - It was Persian.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   But this guy--
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.060]   - He doesn't go to school.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.540]   - He hasn't been to the school
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.860]   or he was not fully exposed to it.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.700]   - Or forgot it.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.340]   - Bazaars usually are very conservative places.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.060]   So it stuck in my mind.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   Now, recently in 2004, I was traveling to the same area,
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.620]   not to the same city, but to the same area.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.860]   And I was amazed to see how the youth,
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.420]   as soon as they would know that you're coming
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.440]   from somewhere else, so to say,
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.960]   opening conversation with you,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.740]   talking about the latest movies
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.120]   that was produced in the West.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.320]   And it's not only Hollywood.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.960]   Of course, there's a huge amount of fascination
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.280]   with Hollywood and Western cinema.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.200]   Cinema is a major thing.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.000]   Filmmaking is a major thing.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:31.840]   - Yeah.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.720]   - So these kids in the city of Ahar
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.760]   were asking me, we were having lunch,
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.440]   they're asking me, okay, then what do you think
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.400]   about this producer, not producer,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.080]   this director or that actor?
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:45.920]   - American.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.300]   - American, European as well, but mostly American.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.140]   - Were they speaking Persian?
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.160]   - It was a complete Persian
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.880]   that I would converse with them.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.160]   - Do they speak English too?
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.000]   Interesting.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.640]   - Yes, actually you would be surprised
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.760]   to see what percentage of the Iranian youth,
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.280]   at least in big cities, are fascinated
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.880]   with learning language, and for a reason.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.680]   Because they think that's the way to get access
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.240]   either on social media or eventually leave Iran,
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.640]   unfortunately.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.200]   And because they don't see a future
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.760]   for themselves in the country,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   either you have to be part of this regime,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.360]   or if you hate them and you don't like
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.720]   the way of their life, you look up outside.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.680]   I was having drivers to drive me around the country
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.640]   in the cities around Tehran.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.600]   And the guy was young, extremely well-educated,
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.240]   well-dressed, and we would have looked at him,
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.280]   we could have found him in any street
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.840]   in any country in the Western world.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.120]   And his major concern, knowing that I'm from outside,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.040]   major concern is, well, tell me which would be
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.200]   a better place for me to go.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.040]   So what's wrong with the place that you're in right now?
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.280]   You are in your own country, you speak your own language,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.720]   no, this is no good.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.560]   I have to have a better future.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.680]   This has no future for me.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.440]   - Well, it's really interesting because the thing
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.720]   I feel about the protests right now is there's
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.280]   a large number of people that instead of giving
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   into cynicism about this government is no good,
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.240]   they're actually getting this energy,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   this desire for revolution in a non-violent,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.960]   in the democratic sense of that.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   Let's actually find the ideas,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.080]   let's build a great nation here.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.000]   This is a great nation, this is my nation,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.320]   let's build something great here.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.560]   - Well--
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.400]   - That's my hope, that's the outside--
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.200]   - That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   - I share your aspiration, but I'm fearing that,
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.800]   I hope it's not a wishful thinking.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.960]   Certainly that's what they want.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.840]   Certainly that's what they want to create.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.720]   But the historian always tells you from where they start
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.160]   to where they finish, there's going to be a huge
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.900]   kind of a change.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:23.480]   And in this particular case, I wouldn't be,
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.160]   I would very much hope that it's not going to be
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.200]   a revolution like 1979, Islamic revolution.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.040]   And I have my hopes in that.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.320]   For one thing, this is a revolution
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.400]   that doesn't have a leader, okay?
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   And it seems that they're comfortable with that.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.320]   At least so far, because we are,
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.800]   well, the sixth week of this movement.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.080]   And I hope it's not going to be actually a revolution,
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.880]   as I pointed out before.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.880]   I hope it's going to be more of a sense of trying to come
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:01.000]   to some compromise and gradually move toward change
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.440]   rather than a collapse of this regime
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.680]   and replacement with what?
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.320]   - So the anxiety of the regime, you hope,
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.280]   will turn into a kind of realization
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.980]   that you have to modernize, you have to make progress,
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.280]   you actually have to make certain compromises.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.120]   - Yes.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.400]   - Or constitutional changes, all those kind of stuff.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:28.360]   So the basic process of government and lawmaking.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.360]   - The problem is that they say we have it all, you know?
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.400]   We have our parliament, we have our constitution,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   we have our elections, which has all been, of course, fake.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.080]   But they claim they have all of that.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   But the problem for them is that they try to superimpose
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:58.840]   a certain ideology, like all other ideological autocracies
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   or autarchies, as in this case, that tend to dominate
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:12.160]   all these institution buildings that they have,
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.240]   and they constantly claim we have this, we have that.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.860]   And of course, it's a generational thing.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.840]   The upper echelons of this regime
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:29.880]   are mostly older people, turbaned, they are the clergy,
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   that are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.080]   over their whole system, that it is a sophisticated,
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.680]   huge system of government.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.400]   And they rely on certain tools of control,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   which is the revolutionary guards and other institutions
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:57.920]   that are loyal to the state.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.120]   And they spend enormous amount of funds
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.880]   that is available to them, at least before the sanctions.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.320]   But even during the sanctions,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.240]   they still have enough funds to do so.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.980]   And in order to remain in power.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.640]   And they're extremely ruthless in that regard.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   This is not a nice Islamic fatherly regime.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.780]   This is a regime that I would see easily in it.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:34.200]   Clear signs of fascism, clear signs of the state's control
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.440]   and pay any price to stay in power.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.840]   - So even violence?
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.540]   - Extreme violence.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.020]   - To return to the massacre,
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.700]   what were the uses of violence to suppress protests?
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.660]   - Well, yes, it was actually quite remarkable
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.220]   to see that from the first or the second day
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.140]   of the protest, you see out in the streets,
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.320]   this riot police, okay?
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:04.820]   Which comes out in large numbers, fully geared up.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:09.300]   Their appearance are rather terrifying,
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:10.960]   like any other riot police,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.920]   probably more than any other riot police.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.380]   They're violent.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.340]   They stand in the streets
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.980]   when the students are demonstrating,
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.780]   even in smaller number.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.940]   Because before I go to that,
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:29.100]   I should point this out to you as well.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:34.100]   That these demonstrations are not large ones in one place.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.900]   You don't see 100,000 people in one place.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.820]   But you see in every neighborhood,
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.420]   couple of thousand of kids are demonstrating.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.300]   - All over Iran?
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.140]   - All over Iran.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.780]   - Now all over the world in different parts?
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.460]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   Actually, during the demonstrations three weeks ago,
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:01.580]   as I said, they had people in Sydney, Australia,
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.660]   New Zealand, Tokyo, all over the world.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:07.540]   - All protesting high gas prices, it's funny.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.820]   Everywhere.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.660]   - Everywhere.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.820]   (laughing)
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.020]   To the extent that they could be ignored.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.860]   - Yeah.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.220]   - Nothing, but if they could not be ignored.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.500]   And it's actually quite remarkable
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.780]   that this is very embarrassing to them.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.940]   But somehow they think that this propaganda machine
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.340]   of them is working.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.860]   - Also you think they don't have a good even sense.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.900]   I mean, so there's an incompetence
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.100]   within the propaganda machine.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.940]   - Yes, it is.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.580]   There's an incompetence across the board.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:40.540]   I mean, despite all of this massive government
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.820]   administration or whatever you would call it,
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.860]   all these various components of it,
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.340]   there is a sense of inefficiency
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.060]   and incompetence that is associated
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.100]   with every action that you see.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.540]   Even in their suppression of this street movement.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.980]   But in answer to that question,
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:05.660]   you would see that they're, this riot police,
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:10.020]   very, it's quite obvious that they were trained
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.180]   for the purpose.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:13.140]   So their appearance, everything,
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.060]   these are not just regular army forces
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.340]   or soldiers, conscripts.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.300]   They are professional forces.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   And they come not only on foot number,
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.380]   but they come on motorbikes.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.980]   So there are, you would see in any of these demonstrations,
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   there are 10, 12, 15, 20 motorbikes with two passengers.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:42.060]   One in front riding, one in the back,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:46.580]   fully equipped with a baton, with paint guns,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.700]   with pellet guns, and with bullets.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.980]   So they are very fully equipped.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.900]   And they are terrifying.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.900]   They go through the demonstrations
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.240]   and hit and beat people.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.020]   And then they arrest.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:06.220]   And then you see behind the first line
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.620]   of these riot police, you would see all this latest
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:15.260]   models of these special
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:21.100]   armored trucks for moving to the demonstrations
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:26.300]   and arresting people, throwing them into this.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:31.300]   And then behind that, water cannons, you see.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.380]   And I was looking at that, I was saying,
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.660]   okay, this is Tehran probably.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.500]   They have this.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.380]   But then you look at the smaller cities,
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.540]   they still have the same thing.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.940]   So all over the country, one thing that they had managed
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.660]   to produce extensively, irrespective of the fact
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.260]   that whether they are effective or not,
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.860]   but you see them everywhere.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.220]   So this shows that how afraid this regime is.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.140]   - But that also shows that there's an infrastructure
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.820]   that can implement violence at scale.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.900]   - Yes, very much so.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:08.320]   And it's probably part and parcel of this regime.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   From day one, the number of prisons that they have,
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.620]   according to perhaps an exaggerated version,
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:23.980]   they said that about 12,000 or so arrested
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:29.700]   that are in jails today, since past six weeks.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:34.620]   They were 230 or 40 people were killed, including children.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.660]   I under 18.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:42.660]   They are, they beat up women,
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.600]   women in the street, which is extremely, actually,
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.820]   disturbing when you see these scenes of--
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.220]   - So there's a lot of this is on video, too, right?
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.420]   - Everything is on video.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.300]   Everybody has a camera.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:04.220]   And everybody sends to major news outlets outside Iran.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:08.700]   And they immediately showed every night,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:12.860]   if you look at BBC Persian or Iran International,
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:16.540]   or a few, I think it is six of them, actually.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.900]   All over, in England, they are in Deutsche Welle in Germany,
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.300]   which has a particular interest in the Iranian,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.360]   BBC World Service and so forth in London,
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.840]   and Voice of America Persian here in this country.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.020]   There is another one, Radio Fado,
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.840]   which is also funded by the American government.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.200]   Also fully covers all of these events.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.680]   So there is no way that these people can,
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.140]   that the Iranians can miss what's going on in the streets
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.680]   of these demonstrations and the scenes of beating up women,
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.520]   which in Iranian culture, as I presume in most cultures
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.200]   in the world, there is a certain sanctity
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   that you don't attack women.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.480]   But they do, and this is an Islamic regime
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   that supposedly have to have a certain sense of concern
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.400]   and protection.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   - Well, like a protection, like a deep respect for women
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.000]   grounded in a tradition of protecting them,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.200]   but instead this kind of idea that was instilled in law
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.040]   has turned into a deep disrespect of women.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   - Exactly, or fear that these women are not any longer
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:43.600]   the girls that we thought we are bringing up in this society.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.520]   - The source of you losing your power will be these women.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.280]   That's the fear. - Yes, yeah.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.560]   And you see, of course, this government
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.360]   do have a support base.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.480]   I mean, it would be totally wrong to think
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.720]   that the Islamic Republic has not created
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.560]   its own power base.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.160]   It does, but it's probably, if there's no way,
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.600]   there are no statistics that we can,
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.960]   or I'm not aware of any statistics
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.760]   that I can give you in numbers,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.440]   what's the percentage of support for the regime in Iran?
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   But quite frankly, I don't think it's more than
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.880]   probably 10% of the population.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.400]   Be very generous.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.280]   - I would be surprised if it's that low.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.760]   I would say, so if my understanding,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.280]   because I've been very deeply paying attention
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.680]   to the war in Ukraine, to Ukraine, to Russia,
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.000]   and to support in Russia for Putin,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.040]   I think, without knowing the details,
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.000]   without even considering the effects of propaganda
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.920]   and stuff like that, is there's probably a large number
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.760]   of people in Iran that don't see this
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.360]   as a battle of human rights,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.920]   but see it as a battle of conservatism,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.000]   like tradition versus modernization,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.520]   and they value tradition.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.200]   What they fear from the throwing away of the hijab
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.000]   is not the loss of power and the women getting human rights.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.720]   What they fear is the same stuff you fear
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.080]   when you're sitting on a porch and saying,
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.400]   "Kids these days have no respect."
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.520]   Basically, there's a large number of Iranians
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.520]   that probably value tradition and the beauty of the culture.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.880]   And they fear that kids with their internet
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.720]   and their videos and their revolution
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.840]   will throw away everything that made this country
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.120]   hold together for millennia, right?
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:44.960]   - Yes, I know.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.360]   I would agree with you in the sense that probably
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.240]   like everywhere else in the world,
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.480]   this is a generational thing.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.920]   Every generation thinks differently
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.520]   about the younger generation, no doubt.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   And in Iran, it's the same.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.600]   But there is another factor here is involved.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   Those that we would consider them as traditional
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   no longer seem to have their loyalties to this regime.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.920]   That's powerful.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   Meaning that they consider it as a brutal regime
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.760]   that is prepared to kill children in the streets.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.080]   And does a lot of things wrong.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   Of course, it tries to take care of its own power base.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.280]   There's a very strong sense of, if we start here,
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.960]   there's a very strong sense in this regime
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.640]   that there are people that is theirs
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.440]   and there are others which are not theirs.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.080]   There's a word for it, if you're very impressed.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.400]   They call it "khudi," one of us, okay?
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.880]   - Oh, so it's a, well, that's very fascistic.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.600]   - Yes, yes, or for that matter,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   I suppose Soviet Union, if you were a member of the party
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.720]   and your children would have received
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.580]   a special kind of treatment, yourself as well.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:13.240]   This sense of us versus them,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:19.480]   for a while worked because the younger people
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.920]   coming from the countryside to the cities,
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   certain sector of them would have found protection
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.320]   and support from the government.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.020]   They wanted to belong to something,
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   and the mosques and the morning associations
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.840]   in the neighborhoods and so forth would have given them.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.120]   There's actually a term for it, it's called "basiji."
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.720]   Those have been recruited by the state,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   and this is the youth kind of vigilante, if you like,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.760]   that you can see them also in these demonstrations.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:08.520]   Sometimes thugs, they're called the civil cloth,
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.320]   so the people that comes to these demonstrations
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.000]   that start beating up these young people,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   and they are not in security police uniforms,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.880]   but they are just regular clothes.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.880]   And these people, yes, they still support,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.680]   and they still benefit, 'cause they get jobs,
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.960]   they get privileges, and these are very important
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   for a state that basically monopolizes
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.320]   most of the resources.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.720]   You see, even during the sanction,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.160]   let alone before the sanction, the oil revenue of Iran,
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.860]   which is the major source of the state government,
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.800]   was the monopoly of the state.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.400]   It was monopoly of the state during the Pahlavi era,
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.720]   from the start, basically.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.280]   So what does that mean?
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.960]   That means that the regime in power is not,
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.080]   no longer is particularly accountable
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.120]   to the majority population,
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.000]   'cause it extracts wealth from underground,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.180]   and it uses it for its own purposes,
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.440]   in order to make it more powerful,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.720]   in order to make it more repressive
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.240]   than what it is, the regime today.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.240]   So it feeds a small, or I wouldn't say,
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.880]   but a fair number of its own supporters.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.200]   I mean, the revolutionary guard in Iran
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.800]   is probably about 350,000, or something like that.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.000]   It's a very big force.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.200]   And this is not the regular army.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:51.400]   The revolutionary guards are independent from the army.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.160]   - Revolutionary guard is armed forces
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.920]   controlled by the state.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.080]   - Yes, the same as the army,
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.080]   but these are more ideologically tied up with the state.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.160]   - And they're also in-facing, internal facing,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.000]   what's the stated purpose of the revolutionary guard?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.320]   - Well, from day one, when the revolution succeeded,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.120]   the regime in power, the Islamic regime in power,
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.680]   was vulnerable to all kinds of forces of opposition
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.120]   within Iran itself.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.800]   - To prevent further revolution.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.240]   - Yeah, that's the revolutionary guards,
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.640]   and their job was to try to make sure
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.920]   that the regime stays in power.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.200]   And of course, over the course of 40 years,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.160]   they became more powerful, more organized,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   better funded, better trained.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.440]   Well, at least we think they're better trained,
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.880]   but we don't know, because the level of incompetence,
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:53.840]   perhaps, can be seen through their rank and file as well.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   But, you know, they developed their own military industry.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.440]   I mean, those drones that you see now,
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.160]   Putin's regime are throwing on Ukrainians,
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.000]   poor Ukrainians, those are all built
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.440]   by the revolutionary guards, by the military industry
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.360]   under the control of the revolutionary guards.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:23.160]   And like similar regimes in the Middle East, at least,
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.140]   these are military industrial complexes.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.180]   You can find them in Egypt, of course,
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.760]   which is very powerful, very traditional,
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.600]   has been in power and still is in power.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:38.400]   You find them in Pakistan, which is extremely powerful,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.800]   and they can change the prime ministers
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.140]   as they did in the case of the last one.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:52.020]   You can find them probably in Myanmar,
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.960]   is the same phenomenon.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   And if you look around, you can find quite a number of them.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.320]   And the revolutionary guards is the equivalent of that.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.320]   This is a powerful establishment force,
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.840]   which militarily is powerful, industrially is powerful.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.120]   And since the start of the revolution,
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.520]   they have been given projects.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.400]   So you want to build dams,
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.080]   which they did a major disaster, environmental disaster.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   They built 100 and something dams all across the country.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.700]   This is the revolutionary guard who does it.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:38.000]   So they have all kinds of tentacles
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.200]   all around the country controlling various things.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.800]   - And because it's their job,
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.440]   and they have power, they have prestige,
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   there's a huge incentive to--
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.280]   - Join them.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.640]   - Yeah, to join them and to stay.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.560]   So like they, you know, when they're having dinner at home
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.760]   with their families, there's not an incentive
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.800]   to join the protests, sort of.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.280]   - Well, that is the point.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.000]   I think, and the revolutionary guards may be an extreme,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.080]   but many of the people who depend on the state
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.880]   for their support, now the younger generation
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.400]   are telling their parents, you were wrong.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.960]   You don't provide for us, this society,
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.520]   this state does not provide what we want.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.240]   So there is a dissent within the family,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.280]   it seems to me.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.440]   I hope it's not a wishful thinking.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.800]   You know, there is a kind of a joke going around.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.040]   You see this, a terrible guy is the clergy,
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.040]   bearded, traditional clerical appearance.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.220]   When you see them talking about women,
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.400]   they are very, of course, politically incorrect.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.440]   They are very looking down towards women.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.400]   As I said, you know, they have to be inside,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.760]   they have to be protected, they have not to be seen,
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.720]   and so forth.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.760]   But if they have a young person,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.640]   a young daughter in their family,
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.540]   you see that their discourse changes.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.440]   They no longer seem to be referring to women
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.240]   as second-class citizens.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.120]   - Yeah.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.480]   - So that's very important, that's precisely that point,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.400]   that when you have this younger generation,
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.200]   no matter how privileged they are,
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.160]   and many of them are privileged, you know,
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.680]   and there is also, the regime has created
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.680]   its own privilege class
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.720]   that are not necessarily directly paid by the regime,
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.240]   but they benefit from contractors,
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.520]   certain professions that benefit
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.320]   from what the state provides for them.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.760]   And Iran is a, I mean, the past 40 years,
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.580]   you can see Iran has developed,
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.260]   in terms of material culture, remarkably.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:14.280]   Iran has good communication, has roads all over the place.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.080]   It's not like a, it's more like,
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.320]   I don't know whether you have ever visited Turkey,
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.480]   for instance. - No, I haven't.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.680]   - In certain respects, even more advanced than Turkey,
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.480]   but it's closer to that, rather than if you travel,
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.640]   I don't want to bring particular names,
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.560]   in North Africa, or parts of the Middle East,
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.820]   or other parts of the Islamic world, it's much, much different.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.320]   So in this respect, you would see
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.240]   certain contrasts or paradoxes here.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.200]   On the certain respect, there is the growth,
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.600]   and there is urbanization, there is modern economy.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.600]   On the other hand, you see this superimposed ideological,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.200]   doctrinal aspect that has driven the regime
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.440]   over all these years, and they cannot get rid of it.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.200]   They cannot, in this respect,
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.800]   they cannot modernize themselves.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.280]   They think that they are already perfect
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.720]   in ideological sense, this is the best solution
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.420]   for the world, not only for Iran,
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.360]   but for the Muslim world, and for the world as a whole.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.320]   We are anti-imperialist, we have managed to survive
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.560]   either under sanctions, this is all part of the rhetoric.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.840]   But of course, at the huge expense,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.620]   the huge expense for their own population.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.040]   And the point that you have raised is the fact
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.040]   that we now witness there is not only a generation gap
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.160]   between the youth and their parents,
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.840]   but there is a break, in a sense,
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.640]   from the older generations.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.760]   And they are very distinctly the youth
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.800]   that has a different view of the world.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.500]   And it does not want to compromise.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.940]   Whether they would be able to succeed or not
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.680]   remains to be seen.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.180]   Whether this regime is going to suppress it, maybe.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:28.500]   But it actually brought to surface many of aspects
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:32.900]   of the weaknesses of this regime in power.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.740]   - Well, I hear from a lot of people
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.220]   that are in these protests now,
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.740]   and so my love goes to them, and stay strong.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.300]   Because it's inspiring to see people
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.700]   fighting for those things, the women, life,
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.620]   and freedom, especially freedom.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.300]   Because that can only lead to a good thing
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.640]   in the long term, at least.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.000]   And if possible, to avoid a violent revolution.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.140]   Of course, that is something that we all want to see.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.980]   Before we return to the present, let's jump around,
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.700]   let's go to the past.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.420]   We mentioned 1979.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.380]   What happened in 1979 in Iran?
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:20.380]   - Well, in 1979, there was a revolution
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:24.260]   that eventually came to be known as the Islamic Revolution.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:28.260]   And even up to this day, many of the observers
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.380]   or those who have strong views would not like
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.580]   to refer to it as an Islamic Revolution,
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.820]   or even a revolution.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.980]   Because the nature of it, in the earlier stages of it,
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.860]   started really probably around 1977, it took two years.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.660]   Was much more all-embracing.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:52.380]   It was not Islamic in a particular fashion,
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.500]   or at all, in a sense.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.700]   It started with a kind of a very liberal,
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   Democrat agenda, which required,
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:09.620]   which demanded, mostly by people who were the veterans
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:14.260]   of the older generations of Iranian liberal nationalists
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.820]   that were left out in the Pahlavi period,
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.500]   is a period of the Shah,
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:25.720]   became increasingly authoritarian,
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.980]   increasingly suppressive,
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   and therefore, basically, leaving no space,
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:41.540]   no political space open for any kind of a give and take,
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.900]   any kind of a conversation or participation.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.020]   - That was in the '70s. - '70s, '70s.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.460]   Particularly in the '70s.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:53.900]   - Can we actually even just do a whirlwind review
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.300]   from 1906 to 1979?
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.620]   - Okay, sure.
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:04.060]   In 1906, there was a period, actually, as you might know,
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:08.900]   the first decade or so of the 20th century,
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.500]   witnessed numerous, what we refer to
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.420]   as constitutional revolutions,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.700]   including Russia in 1905, the first revolution,
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.820]   including the Chinese Revolution in 19,
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.340]   constitutional revolution in 1910,
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:26.020]   the Young Turks Revolution in 1908,
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.020]   and the Iranian Revolution in 1906.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.700]   - Do I understand why the synchronicity of all of it,
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.100]   why in so many different places,
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.860]   very different cultures, very different governments?
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.220]   - Very different cultures, but all of them,
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:42.220]   in a sense, were coming out of regimes
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.260]   that became progressively powerful
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:52.540]   without having any kind of a legal system
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.580]   that would protect the individual vis-a-vis the state.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.100]   So the idea of law and the constitution,
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.660]   according to which there should be a certain protection,
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.100]   a certain civil society, became very common.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.900]   - Yeah, but I wonder where that,
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.780]   'cause that's been that way for a very, very long time,
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.340]   and so I wonder, you know, it's funny,
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.060]   certain ideas, just their time comes.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   - Exactly, it's like 1848, when you would see
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:28.860]   that there's a whole range of revolutions across Europe,
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:33.060]   or you would see, for instance, the Arab Spring.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   You see all these revolutions in the Arab world,
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:38.700]   which unfortunately, nearly all of them failed.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.900]   So yes, these are very contagious ideas
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:46.740]   that moves across frontiers from one culture to another,
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:50.620]   and I presume we can add to that there are two elements
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.140]   which one can say there was a greater communication,
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:57.580]   there is a greater sense of a world economy,
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.740]   and the turn of the century witnessed,
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.140]   the first decade of the century,
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.700]   witnessed a period of volatility,
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.700]   particularly in currency.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.620]   So many of the countries of the world,
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.540]   particularly non-West, suffered,
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.700]   particularly the businesses suffered,
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.780]   and not surprisingly, the business class
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.340]   were in the forefront of many of these
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.460]   constitutional movements, requiring the state
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:36.460]   to give the, kind of create the right kind of institutions
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:41.980]   to listen to their voices, to their concerns,
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.180]   and the creation of a democratic system,
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.020]   parliamentary system in which there would be
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.580]   a representation, popular representation,
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.180]   proper elections and so forth, and constitutions.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.660]   And this very much is a kind of a French idea
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.420]   of the constitution going back all the way,
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.100]   perhaps to 1789 revolution, Montesquieu,
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:11.100]   all this kind of philosophes were greatly appreciated,
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.740]   particularly the French system.
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:16.740]   - So what were the ideas in the 1906 Iranian constitution?
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.820]   - They, precisely the same, they were demanding
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.820]   a creation of a legal system with division of power
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.300]   between the three, executive, legislative,
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:34.300]   and the judiciary, not unlike the American system.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:39.300]   And they requested basically a certain public space
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:45.540]   to be created between the two sources of power,
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.800]   the state, which had this kind of a control
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.320]   over the, if you like, the secular aspect of life
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.140]   in the society, and the religious establishment
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.140]   that had a full control over the religious aspects.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.940]   And both of them, from the perspective of the constitution,
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.960]   it is considered as repressive, and therefore,
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.620]   there has to be a new space open between these two.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.580]   And that was the idea of a constitutional revolution.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.740]   By its very nature, it was an idea of modernity.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.900]   They wanted a modern society.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:26.380]   They wanted a better material life.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.580]   They wanted more representation, and so forth.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:33.940]   The constitutional revolution, as I always would say,
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.860]   is much more of an innocent revolution.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.240]   It's a revolution that did not particularly
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.200]   have much violence in it, contrary to many other revolutions.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.060]   It did not have a centralized leadership, per se.
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:51.120]   That's why, actually, I'm getting,
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.680]   I mean, besides the practices,
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.400]   I'm getting a lot of requests for interviews
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.800]   to compare what's happening now
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.520]   with the revolution of 1906, 1909.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.960]   - Are there any echoes?
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.920]   - Yes, yes, there are, there are.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.060]   Because that was a movement that started
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:13.060]   without a centralized leadership,
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.620]   but actually various voices that emerged
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.740]   in various, among the merchants,
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:24.460]   or the businessmen in the economic community,
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:29.340]   among the representatives who came to the first parliament,
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.940]   the press, the new generation
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:35.380]   of the privileged aristocracy
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:40.380]   who were educated and believed in the constitutional values.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.980]   All of these voices emerged at the same time,
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.460]   and somehow they managed to coexist
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:55.980]   in the first and the second parliaments
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:01.260]   that were created between 1906 and 1910, or 1911.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.420]   But they all faced huge problems,
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:11.540]   in the sense that Iran was in a dire economic situation.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.020]   This is before the days of the discovery of oil,
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.060]   which actually coincides in the discovery.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.980]   There are two important coincidences.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:24.500]   One is that the oil was discovered in the South in 1909,
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.820]   during the course of the constitutional revolution.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.020]   The second is that in 1907,
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.140]   the two great powers of the time,
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.740]   the Russian Empire and the British Empire,
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:41.100]   who always honored Iran as being a buffer state
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.180]   between them, because they didn't want
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.060]   to get too close to one another,
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:50.140]   basically came to an agreement facing the fear
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.800]   of the rise of the German Empire.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.260]   So this is the period of Entente,
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.500]   as you might know in European history,
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.060]   whereby the French, the British, and the Russians
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:07.060]   all create an alliance that ultimately leads
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.220]   to the First World War against Germany.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.900]   - And at the same time, the discovery of oil,
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.940]   that the oil industry being a very powerful,
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.380]   defining factor of the 20th century for Iran.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.340]   - Exactly.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.140]   - Source of a lot of money.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.100]   - Lot of money, but not all of it
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.420]   in the hands of the Iranians.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.780]   Only one fifth of it, by way of royalties,
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.820]   came to Iran.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:34.820]   Much of it went to the Anglo-Persian oil company,
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.500]   which they actually discovered the oil in the province,
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.780]   Khuzestan province in the southwest of Iran,
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.740]   where the major oil industry is today, right now.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.740]   And this was an extremely profitable enterprise
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.740]   for that company, and for the British government.
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.300]   It was actually purchased by the British government.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.900]   Churchill purchased Anglo-Iranian oil company
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.620]   for the British government.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.220]   So it was not anymore a private company.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.380]   It was a British interest, as a matter of fact.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.100]   And in the course of the 20th century,
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.180]   although it helped the modernization in Iran,
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.420]   but it also helped the creation of a more authoritative,
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:20.900]   a more strong state, if you like to call it.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.860]   That 19th century Iran never had that kind of a power.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.940]   Never had that kind of resources.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.940]   Is it 20th century, even that one fifth of the income
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.120]   that reached the Iranian state gave it a greater power.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.900]   - That's another coincidence.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.500]   So yes, yes, you could say the oil was one of the catalysts
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.260]   for absolute power, but the 20th century
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:49.300]   saw quite a few countries
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.100]   have dictators with power
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.100]   unlike anything else in human history.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.060]   - Yes.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.740]   - That's weird too.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.180]   - Precisely.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.020]   And you know, you can name them
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.700]   from the beginning of the century with people like,
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:09.420]   I don't know, Lenin, Stalin, of course Hitler.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.620]   - Mao.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:13.460]   - Mao, of course, you can name them.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.260]   And probably, as I would say,
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.020]   the last of them is Khomeini in that century,
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.620]   that you would see this strong man
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.620]   with a sense of a,
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.500]   either artificial or real,
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.660]   or a sense of a so-called charisma,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.660]   and with this total power over the regime that they create.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   Some of them do, Nasser,
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.060]   he didn't have much of an oil resources in Egypt,
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.160]   but he was also one of these strong men, okay,
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.920]   in the 20th century.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.160]   Loved by some, hated by others.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.220]   So it necessarily does not tie up
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:59.220]   to economic resources underground.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.520]   But in the Iranian case, unfortunately it did.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.720]   And it was a,
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.580]   it was more than,
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.420]   it created more than one issue for Iran.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.740]   It's created a strong state,
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.900]   which is the Pahlavi state,
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.040]   from 1921 onward.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.160]   Because in 1921, at the end of the First World War,
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.840]   Iran was in almost a state of total bankruptcy.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.460]   And the British had a desire
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.820]   to try to bring Iran to the system
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.300]   that they created in the Middle East
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:37.360]   in the post-war era, the mandate system.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.380]   Palestine, Iraq, and then, of course,
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.740]   French mandate of Lebanon and Syria, all of this.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.460]   And Iran was separate because Iran
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.700]   was an independent country.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.260]   It wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire that collapsed.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:52.680]   So they had to somehow handle it.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.300]   And what they tried to do didn't work.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:01.020]   As a result, partly domestic,
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:03.260]   partly international issues,
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.700]   wrote about a regime which is headed
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.940]   by the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Shah.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.860]   Okay, a first military officer called Reza Khan,
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:18.060]   actually a military officer of the Cossack forces.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:20.380]   And the Cossack forces was the force
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.420]   that was created in the 19th century
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.980]   model of the Russian Cossacks.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.980]   When the ruler in the 19th century visited Russia
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.780]   as in a royal tour, and the desire showed
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:38.460]   the great Cossack forces, he said, "I like this."
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.660]   And he created one for himself
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.140]   with Russian officers, actually.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.980]   So Russian officers served in Iran
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:49.860]   from around 1880s up to the revolution of 1917,
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.940]   the collapse of the Cossack regime.
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.220]   - So many revolutions.
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:54.580]   - So many revolutions.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.780]   And Reza Shah was an officer in that, Reza Khan
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.260]   was an officer in that force.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.500]   And he created a new monarchy for reasons
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.180]   that we need not to go to it.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.900]   And this called the Pahlavi regime.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.860]   Pahlavi regime was a modernizing regime, okay?
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.860]   That brought, in effect, fulfilled many of the ambitions
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:20.700]   of the Constitution, many of the aspirations
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.380]   of the Constitutional Revolution.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:27.380]   Better communication, secular education,
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:32.120]   centralized states, centralized army,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.980]   better contact with the outside world,
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.060]   greater urbanization, that's what a modern state
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:40.940]   is all about.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:46.380]   And in that regard, in a sense, for the first 20 years
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.600]   up to the Second World War, was successful.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:54.180]   Despite, and more significant of all,
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.740]   it managed to keep the European powers,
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:01.260]   which was always interfering in the local affairs
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.740]   of Iran, in an arm's length.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.740]   So they were there in an arm's length,
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:12.660]   but they were also respecting the power of the state,
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.100]   power of the Pahlavi state.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:20.620]   During the Second World War, the same phenomenon
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:25.620]   as earlier interference led to the occupation of Iran
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.620]   by the Allied forces, the British from the south,
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:33.340]   the Russians from the north, the Red Army.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.180]   They took over Iran, and of course they said--
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.140]   - The Second World War.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.340]   - Yes, from 1941 up to 1945.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:46.340]   And of course, when the Red Army refused to withdraw
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:53.740]   from Iranian Azerbaijan, and with some thought
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:59.780]   of possible annexation of that province,
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:03.460]   there was a big issue in the post-war Iran.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.140]   - So after 1945--
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:09.980]   - Yes, 1945 to 1946, there was a big--
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.380]   - Soviet Union getting greedy.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.580]   - Yes, but eventually they agreed.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:17.980]   Eventually Stalin agreed to leave the Azerbaijan province
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.380]   in the hope that it would get some concessions from Iran,
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:25.700]   which in the oil of the Caspian area,
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.460]   which didn't work, and it's a different story altogether.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.460]   But what happened is that in the post-war era,
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:39.700]   between 1944, '45, and 1953,
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:46.580]   is a period of greater democratization,
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.460]   because Reza Shah's dictatorship basically disappeared.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:57.180]   And this is where you would see political parties,
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.420]   free press, a lot of chaotic, really,
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:04.100]   as democracies often are.
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:07.380]   - So something like, was it officially a democracy?
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.900]   - Yes, it was a democracy.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.240]   - Was there elections?
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.300]   - There were elections, yes, of course, yes, of course.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:18.100]   And there were very diverse political tendencies
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.820]   came to the picture, including the Tudeh Party of Iran,
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.900]   which is Communist Party of Iran.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:27.080]   This Communist Party of Iran is probably the biggest
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.300]   Communist Party of the whole of the Middle East,
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:34.020]   and one of the biggest in the world, actually, at that time.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.140]   - Did the Soviet Union have a significant influence on--
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:40.620]   - Of course, they were basically following orders
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.180]   from the Soviets, although they denied it,
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.740]   but in reality, that's the case.
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:49.100]   But what happened, they were seen by the Americans
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:53.860]   during the Cold War as a threat,
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.900]   and Iran was going through a period
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.380]   of demanding nationalization of its oil resources.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:03.140]   That's a very important episode, with Mossadegh,
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.440]   whom you might have heard about his name.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.660]   Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh, who was the prime minister
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:13.660]   and the national charismatic leader from 1951 to 1953.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:17.760]   Prior to that, he was a famous parliamentarian,
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.460]   but this period, he was the prime minister of Iran,
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.500]   and he nationalized the Iranian oil industry,
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.400]   and the British didn't like it at all,
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.560]   and eventually resulted in a famous coup,
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:35.840]   which at least partly was supported by the funding
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   and by the moral support of the British and the Americans,
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.580]   particularly by the Americans.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:48.740]   It was always seen as one of the earliest
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:53.740]   and the most successful CIA operations during the Cold War.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.420]   - So CIA had something to do with it?
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.620]   - Yes, of course, that's one of the earliest operations
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:58.620]   of the CIA.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.500]   - Wait a minute, what was, yes, of course,
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.980]   what was the CIA doing?
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:06.940]   - CIA, this is the time at the post-war era.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:07.900]   - In the '50s.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.040]   - In the '50s, '40s and the '50s.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.040]   The British Empire, which was really the major superpower
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.700]   of the region after the collapse of the Tzarist Empire,
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:25.700]   gradually took the second seat to the Americans,
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.460]   who were the newcomers and the great power
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.860]   and the victors of the Second World War,
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:36.440]   and the Americans viewed Iran as an important country,
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:44.500]   since it has the largest common borders
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.500]   with the Soviet Union, and it was,
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.260]   and in the south was the Persian Gulf,
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:54.540]   which at the time was the greatest supplier
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:35:00.780]   of oil to the outside world,
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.620]   and therefore the Americans had a particular interest
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.220]   in Iran, and in the earlier stages,
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.140]   their interest was in the interest of the Iranian government
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:15.140]   because they wanted to get rid of both the Soviet Union,
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.260]   which made a return in the post-war era,
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.980]   and of course the British that were gradually withdrawing
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:27.820]   from Iran, but they had a full control
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:30.140]   over the Anglo-Iranian oil company.
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.780]   They changed the name to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.780]   When the name of the country officially changed
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:39.260]   from Persia to Iran, in the west,
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:42.900]   the name of the company changed,
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:47.780]   and they got into a huge dispute with the other government
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:52.100]   that eventually led to the coup of 1953,
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.180]   which eventually created a very,
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.500]   a very distressful memory in the minds
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.160]   of many of the Iranian nationalists,
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.100]   that this was the betrayal of the great powers,
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.140]   the British and Americans.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:12.660]   Yes, CIA played a part because CIA feared,
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.740]   contrary to the British, that they were afraid
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:18.940]   of their own oil in Iran, the CIA was afraid
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:23.940]   of the Soviet penetration in the south,
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.020]   and particularly because there was a very powerful,
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.620]   very powerful Communist Party in Iran,
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:31.620]   the Tudeh Party of Iran.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:36.620]   So they gradually shifted between the Truman administration
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:39.180]   and Eisenhower administration,
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.560]   these are early days of the CIA,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.300]   and then they actually did participate
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.220]   to send their agents.
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.740]   There's a long story to that,
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:54.820]   and it eventually resulted in a successful coup
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.100]   that removed Mossadegh from power.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.460]   - What's the United States' interest here?
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.900]   Why are they using CIA?
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.860]   Are they trying to make sure there's not
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.340]   too much centralization of power in this region?
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.300]   - They were afraid of the fact that the,
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:12.820]   that of the Soviet Union, and during the Cold War,
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:15.140]   that was their concern, only concern.
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:17.940]   - They actually almost want to protect Iran
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:21.300]   and its own sovereign processes from influence
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.660]   of the Soviets. - Yes.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:26.540]   'Cause they were afraid of the fact if Iran,
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.020]   or at least this is part of the,
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.460]   I'm simplifying a very complex picture,
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.300]   but the Americans basically were thinking
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:40.140]   that if Iran is going to be lost to Soviet influence,
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.460]   then eventually, basically, all the oil resources
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:47.360]   in the Persian Gulf are going to be threatened.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.200]   - Yeah.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.540]   - And this would basically is the national security
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:56.780]   of the United States and all of the Western allies,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:58.340]   European allies.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:02.620]   So in a sense, this was the long arm of the CIA
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:07.620]   to try to make sure that that's not going to happen.
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:11.100]   And then, of course, they were persuaded by the British.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:12.980]   Because British were the old hand,
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:16.540]   which were in Iran since the beginning of the 19th century.
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:19.520]   They always had relations with Iran and so forth.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.300]   So they gradually replaced.
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.680]   And of course, I don't want to give them
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.620]   this kind of a satanic view that Americans
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.620]   was a bad influence, because they had also
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.820]   some very good influences in Iran.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.820]   But this particular episode somehow shed a dark light
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.180]   on the American presence and was used
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:46.220]   and abused time and again, particularly
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:51.140]   the revolution in 1979, which was this great Satan idea
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:54.180]   that Khomeini created, basically was based
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.520]   on the fact is 1953, you were responsible
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.100]   for the downfall of a national government in Iran.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.820]   Which as a matter of fact, he had no respect for it.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:08.580]   Khomeini had no respect for the secular,
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.660]   nationally liberals, including Mohammad Mossadegh.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.020]   But he was using it as a rhetorical tool
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.580]   for his own purposes.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:22.320]   But what happened is that after 1953,
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:28.460]   we see again the rise of authoritarian
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.900]   Mohammad Reza Shah's power.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:33.520]   - And that he's, that's the Shah?
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.100]   - That's the Shah, that we know as Shah.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.780]   This is son of Reza Shah.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:40.980]   - And technically, what is Shah?
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.860]   - Shah is an old term in Persian
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:49.420]   that comes from a pre-Islamic Persian of ancient times.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.140]   - So in the context of democracy,
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:54.740]   should it be seen as like a supreme leader, king?
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.300]   - Is the head of the executive power,
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.860]   according to the Constitution of 1906.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.740]   - Oh, that's in the Constitution, the actual term Shah.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.620]   - Of course, he has a place in the Constitution.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.660]   - But the actual term Shah, okay, interesting.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.860]   - But the Shah is a very old term.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.020]   - Yeah, it's almost like a monarchic term, like a king.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.960]   - Yeah, it is actually is a term peculiar to Iran.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.740]   I've written about it somewhere.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:22.860]   But because the term, the Western word in the ancient times
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:26.680]   has been rex for royalty and the king.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.320]   In the Eastern world, in India, is raj,
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.260]   is the same origin, the same root.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.580]   Iran never shared that.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.860]   They had the idea of, because rex and raj,
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.700]   I don't want to get into too much of etymology,
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.980]   but this is an interesting one.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:46.780]   Rex and raj both means the one that opens the road
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:51.500]   for basically enforcer of religion, okay?
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:56.580]   Enforcer of the right religion.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.380]   Because rex and raj both have the,
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:04.380]   of the etymological origin of right, you see?
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.920]   And raj means the right religion, basically.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.600]   - By the way, there's so much beautiful language here.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.280]   I'm just looking at the Persian Constitution in 1906,
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.960]   and it says it's the constitution
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:20.880]   of the sublime state of Persia, Qajar Iran.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.600]   I mean, just the extra adjectives
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.320]   on top of this stuff is beautiful.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.280]   - Yeah, because that was actually the change that came about.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.640]   I don't want to go too much into it.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.680]   But it was called, as I pointed out before,
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.880]   the guarded domains of Iran.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.960]   They changed that to the sublime state of Iran
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.800]   during the constitutional revolution.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.560]   Because they wanted to give a greater sense
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.920]   of centrality of the state.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.840]   And sublime was the term we used.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.400]   - But also, what permeates all of this is a poetic,
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.200]   I mean, there is a history of poetry to the culture.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.020]   - Of course, very strong, very strong.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:58.860]   - Which is fascinating.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.440]   So I mean, of course, I don't speak the language,
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.440]   but even in Russian, there's also a music
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.600]   to the soul of the people that represents itself,
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.620]   that presents itself in the form of poetry and literature
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:17.160]   in the way that it doesn't in the English-speaking world.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.080]   I don't know what that is.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.080]   There's a--
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.480]   - Yeah, there's a romantic side.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.320]   - Romantic side.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.140]   - To all my students.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:22.980]   - Romantic side, that's right.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:24.040]   - Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.440]   In Iran, of course, you know,
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.440]   there's a time of the constitutional revolution,
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440]   is a time of great poetry.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.400]   This kind of a patriotic sentiments
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.480]   that comes through poetry plays a very important part.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:45.440]   Of course, these days, poetry has kind of declined,
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.080]   and instead, you see the visual image
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.120]   that is at the center.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.040]   That's why cinema is so important.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.700]   - Kids these days with their TikTok.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.520]   - Yeah, let me finish this about the period
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.000]   of Muhammad Reza Shah.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000]   He built up, because he received a greater income
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.840]   from the oil revenue, and he built up a very strong state
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.840]   with a strong security force, a strong security apparatus,
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:19.400]   which is the SAVAK, which is an acronym
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.960]   for the security force in security organization.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.360]   And he, of course, unfortunately,
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.600]   in the 1960s and '70s, particularly in the 1970s,
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.000]   basically suppressed the voices of,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.320]   or the possibility of any kind of a mass participation
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.360]   in the political process.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.840]   It became very much an authoritarian regime
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.520]   with its own technocrats,
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:52.360]   very much a modernist vision of Iran's future,
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:56.200]   and almost kind of messianic,
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:59.080]   that he was hoping that Iran, in a decade,
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.120]   would become the fifth most powerful state in the world,
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.840]   and the riches, as he would have said,
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.720]   the gates of the great civilization,
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.400]   very much in the mind, had this image of ancient Iran
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400]   of the Achaemenid Empire.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.680]   And we want to go back to that greatness
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.360]   of the Achaemenid Empire, somewhat rather naive
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:25.720]   and very nationalistic in a crude fashion.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.320]   And what happened is that, as a result,
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.280]   there was built up some kind of a resistance
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.280]   from the intellectuals, from the left,
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.960]   eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement,
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.540]   as I said, by 1977, 1978.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.920]   Then, of course, the question that comes to mind,
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.580]   and that probably you would like to know about,
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.880]   is the fact that why it becomes religious,
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:53.720]   why it becomes Islamic,
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   if it's the popular nationalist, liberal tendency
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.920]   of opening up the political space
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.640]   and allowing greater participation,
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   going back to the Constitution of 1906, 1907,
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.480]   why it's all of a sudden, it becomes Khomeini,
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.420]   where does he come from?
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:22.440]   The reason for that, at least in a concise fashion,
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.420]   is the fact that on one area,
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:31.240]   that after the greater suppression
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:36.240]   of all the other voices remained open, was religion.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:42.040]   Mosques, the mullahs on the pulpit,
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.200]   and the message that gradually shifted
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.200]   from all the traditional message of the sharia of Islam,
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.120]   I mean, all the rules and regulations
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.960]   of how one has to live, into something very political,
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.560]   and not only political, but also radical political.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:11.720]   So, in the whole period from the Constitutional Revolution
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.100]   to the Revolution of 1979,
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.520]   basically the religious establishment
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.920]   gradually was pushed to the opposition.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.680]   They were not originally very conservative,
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   supporters of the state, as the Catholic Church,
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.680]   for instance, was supportive of majority
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.460]   of the authoritarian governments around the world.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:39.040]   But the politicization was the result of isolation,
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:42.520]   because they were left out of the system.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.480]   And while in isolation, they did not,
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.480]   they were not successful in trying to reform themselves,
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:56.080]   to try to become, to try to find answers
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.740]   to many of the questions of modern times.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:00.140]   What happens to women?
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.920]   What happens to civil rights?
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:05.000]   What happens to a civil society?
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000]   How modern law and individual freedoms
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.400]   have to be defined in Islamic terms?
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.280]   - How to separate religion and state?
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.000]   - Or how to separate religion and state?
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]   These issues were never addressed.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.200]   What happened is that there was this bypass
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.200]   through political Islam, and revolutionary Islam,
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.280]   as it gradually, they learned, you know,
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.480]   that this is the bypass, bypass to power, basically,
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:40.920]   to become again a voice in the society,
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.900]   and eventually a prominent voice,
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.700]   and eventually a monolithic voice in the society.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.700]   That's the process that led into the revolution of 1979.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:56.200]   Basically, this period, greater attention was paid
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.900]   to religion, even among the secular middle classes,
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:04.580]   who were alienated for a very long time
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:08.020]   because of this extensive modernization
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.500]   of the Pahlavi period.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:13.020]   They didn't have a sense of that old
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.060]   monolithic disturbance, but they became,
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:19.420]   they had a kind of aura in this period.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:23.080]   Yes, they are those who remained not corrupted.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.300]   They are the people who basically went against
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.340]   the suppression of the Pahlavi regime,
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:34.980]   and Khomeini became a leader, a symbol of that.
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:38.140]   Nobody ever thought in the earlier stages,
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.900]   among this very excited multitudes that came
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.900]   to the streets of the Iranian cities in 1979,
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:52.100]   or 1978, actually, thought that this old,
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:56.460]   more like in the '70s, that all of a sudden
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:01.460]   has appeared from the Najaf through Paris to Tehran,
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:06.900]   is going to take over and create a autocracy,
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.860]   a religious autocracy.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.340]   - We have to back up for just a second.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.700]   Who is Khomeini?
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:17.500]   You just mentioned a few disparate facts about the man.
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.340]   - Yes.
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.980]   - He was the person that took power in 1979,
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:22.460]   the supreme leader of Iran.
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:23.300]   - Yes.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:24.660]   - You mentioned something about Paris,
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.260]   something about being in the '70s.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.300]   - Yes.
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:28.940]   - What should we know about the guy?
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:32.460]   - Ayatollah Khomeini, who eventually was known
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.380]   as Imam Khomeini, he was kind of promoted
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:37.660]   to an even more sublime position.
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:40.600]   - Okay, can we, just a million tangents.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.220]   Ayatollah, Imam, what do these terms mean?
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:49.660]   - Well, Ayatollah means the sign of God.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:55.820]   In the course of the 19th century, or early 20th century,
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:58.940]   as the religious establishment gradually lost
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.820]   its greater presence in the society
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.380]   and its prominent places in society,
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.460]   they had some kind of an inflation in titles.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:12.060]   So they gave themselves more grand titles.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:13.460]   - Yeah, more adjectives.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:17.340]   - More adjectives, more grand titles, such as Ayatollah,
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:21.320]   that became a kind of a highest rank
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.580]   of the religious hierarchy.
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:24.420]   - But it's not--
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:27.580]   - Which incidentally was in an unofficial hierarchy.
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:32.580]   It was not like the Catholic church that you have,
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.740]   you know, bishops and, you know, further off.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:38.100]   It was very unofficial model.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.220]   And he was an Ayatollah, was eventually recognized
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.340]   as an Ayatollah.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.740]   - He wasn't the first Ayatollah?
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.020]   - No, no, no, not at all.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.900]   The Ayatollahs were before him ever since the beginning
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.220]   of the century.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.140]   But he was eventually recognized as an Ayatollah.
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:59.580]   And if I want to start it this way,
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:02.060]   Ayatollah Khomeini was born in 1900.
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:08.180]   And in a sense, all this tremendous change
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:13.440]   that Iran witnessed in the course of the 20th century,
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:18.860]   was in a sense materializing this person.
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.620]   He become a mullah of a lower rank,
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.300]   went to the traditional madrasas,
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:31.220]   to the traditional centers for the education
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.920]   of the seminarians, never had a secular education,
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.900]   had a very complex Islamic education
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.760]   on this one hand jurisprudence, on the other hand,
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.260]   probably a little bit of Islamic philosophy and mysticism,
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:50.980]   which is unusual for the jurists,
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.640]   for the faqih, as they call them.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:00.640]   These religious scholars or legal scholars of Islam.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:05.300]   And then he, in the 1960s,
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:10.060]   when he was residing in Tehran,
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.620]   and gradually becoming more important,
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:18.140]   he became a voice of opposition against the Shah.
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:23.140]   And the reason for opposition in the early 1960s
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:29.160]   was the fact that the Shah carried through a series
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.160]   of extensive modernization policies,
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:37.680]   of which the most important was the land reform.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.200]   So in effect, the land distribution that took place
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.940]   in the early '60s, removed or weakened greatly
[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:52.940]   that class of landowners from the 19th century.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:58.680]   And he, Khomeini, saw himself as a voice
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:04.240]   of that old class that felt that,
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:08.620]   actually declared that this land redistribution
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:12.940]   is un-Islamic according to the Islamic law.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:17.940]   Property is honored, and you cannot just,
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:25.420]   no matter how much and how large are these estates
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.520]   that the landowning class has,
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:29.960]   the government has no right to redistribute it,
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.760]   even among the peasants, among the people
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:37.080]   who are tilling the land.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.760]   So that was a major issue.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:43.760]   Shah also gave the right of vote to women.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:51.840]   And that also he objected,
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.480]   he said women should not have a right.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.040]   - Can we just linger on the Islamic law?
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.980]   How firm and clear is the Islamic law
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:04.880]   that he was representing and embodying?
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.480]   Is this-- - Codified?
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:10.040]   - Codified, yes, that's a good term.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.800]   - That's another issue.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:16.800]   Not only the hierarchy was unofficial and informal,
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.840]   but also Islamic law, particularly Shia law,
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.540]   did not have any codified system,
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:33.740]   because these religious authorities always resisted
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:39.780]   becoming under a umbrella of a more codified system
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:44.780]   of Islamic law, because they were outside the state
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.100]   in a sense, civil law was in the hand
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.500]   of the religious establishment,
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.900]   they had their own courts independent of the state.
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.360]   But other matters, legal matters,
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.720]   was in the hand of the government.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.840]   There was a kind of de facto division
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.740]   between these two institutions,
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:04.720]   state versus the religious establishment.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.920]   Therefore it was not codified.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.260]   So he could declare that this is unofficial,
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:13.700]   or sorry, illegal, according to the Islamic law,
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.180]   that you would distribute land to the peasants.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:20.580]   And another mujtahid, or another religious authority,
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.620]   would say no, no, it is perfectly fine,
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:26.220]   because he would have a different reading of the law.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:29.540]   So that being in mind, that adds to the complexity
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:34.540]   of the picture, he, in 1963, there was a period
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.820]   of uprising of the supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.420]   That was a turning point in a sense,
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:46.420]   to try to politicize the religious supporters
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:50.900]   of Ayatollah, who were loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:53.500]   And in a sense, all the community
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.060]   of more religiously orientated,
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:59.860]   against the secular policies of the Shah,
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:03.900]   and against, of course, the dictatorship of the Shah.
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.420]   - So that's where the religious movement
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.260]   became a political party.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:09.100]   - Became, in 1963 is the first moment,
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:10.780]   it's a huge uprising.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:12.700]   And the government suppressed it.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:17.940]   - But then, suppression would start to build.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.180]   - Of course.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:21.660]   And he was sent to exile.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.900]   He went to Najaf, which is this great center in southern.
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.820]   - So became a martyr on top of this.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.500]   - At the martyr, he was probably even forgotten
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.100]   to some extent.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:37.100]   But not, he was forgotten for the secular middle class.
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.740]   But not to those supporters of his,
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.220]   who were paying him their dues,
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.220]   because in Islam, you would pay dues to religious leaders.
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.060]   You know, there's religious dues and alms
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.540]   that you would pay to the clerical authorities,
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:59.680]   and they redistribute them among their own students,
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:00.540]   and so forth.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:03.020]   So they built, actually, a network of loyalty
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:06.100]   based on these donations.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.020]   And these donations that received by Ayatollah Khomeini
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.460]   was very effectively through his network,
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.720]   was distributed, even if he was in exile outside Iran.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:23.660]   So, the 1977, 1978, when the situation changed,
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:28.540]   and there was a little bit of opening
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.100]   in the political climate,
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:34.660]   then you saw that Ayatollah Khomeini
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:39.360]   started sending cassette messages.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.700]   That was his mean of communication.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.780]   Was sending cassettes, and cassettes were sent
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:48.180]   through the country by his network.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:52.100]   So, or declarations, and saying first
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:57.040]   that we would like to see a greater democratization,
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:02.020]   and the Shah has to abide by the constitution
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.740]   of 1907, this is a constitution,
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:07.660]   this is a democratic system, and so forth.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:09.020]   - Was he charismatic?
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:11.040]   - Well, it depends who would call,
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.380]   what you call charismatic.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:16.540]   He had a long beard, he was kind of a man
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:21.540]   in turban and the gown, which was a very unusual
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:26.620]   leadership for people who were much more accustomed
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:29.900]   to the civilian clothing, or to the equipments
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:33.460]   of the Shah's military uniforms that he used to wear.
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:35.580]   - But I also mean like, he is a man
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:38.080]   that was able to take power, to become popular,
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.460]   sufficiently popular. - Yes.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:44.420]   - So, I would like, is it the ideas, is it an accident,
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:47.060]   or is it the man himself, the charisma,
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:49.020]   or something about the man that led
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.020]   to this particular person basically changing
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:56.740]   the tide of history in this part of the world,
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.820]   in a way that was unexpected?
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.500]   - All the above that you mentioned--
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.860]   - Or was it just the beard?
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:06.700]   - No, I think no, it's beyond the appearance.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.060]   The appearance greatly helps, as you know.
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:10.060]   - Yeah. - You know?
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.660]   - In the 20th century, appearance is helpful.
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:15.300]   Yeah, pictures for propaganda, for messaging.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:17.260]   - Yeah, that's an important factor.
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:22.260]   And he was kind of adamant and very severe
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:30.020]   in his own positions.
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:34.380]   He could appear very uncompromising,
[01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:40.740]   and he had a sense of confidence, self-confidence,
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.380]   that virtually everybody else lacked.
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:49.580]   And he was a man of opportunity.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:54.180]   As soon as he would see that a chance,
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.740]   an opportunity would open up, he would jump on it.
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:02.100]   And that's what he did, basically.
[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:05.780]   As more the political space opened,
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:09.820]   the weaknesses of the Shah's government became more evident.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:13.380]   His indecision became more evident.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:17.540]   His lack of confidence became more evident.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.900]   Khomeini managed to move further
[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.540]   into the center of the movement
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:27.020]   because he was the only authority
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:31.740]   that had this network of support through the mosques,
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:36.700]   through the people who paid homage to him,
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.220]   who followed him, because there's a sense of following
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:43.300]   of the religious leader in Shi'ism.
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:45.100]   You are a follower of this authority,
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.620]   you're a follower of that authority.
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:52.620]   And he's basically created an environment
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:56.980]   in which people looked upon him
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:59.260]   as a kind of a messianic figure
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:05.260]   that came to save Iran from what they considered
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:10.260]   at the time the problems of dictatorship under the Shah.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:15.100]   - So there's not a suspicion about Islamic law
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.540]   being the primary law of the land?
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:17.540]   - Not at all.
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:19.980]   People had very little sense
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:22.500]   that what Islamic law is all about,
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:26.020]   because the secular education has left that
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.980]   into the old religious schools.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:32.700]   This is not something that ordinary educated Iranian
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:36.140]   who goes to the universities is going to learn.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.460]   Therefore, there is a sense of idealization
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.260]   that there is something great there.
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:45.060]   And there were quite a number of intellectuals
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:49.020]   who also viewed this kind of an idea
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:52.540]   of they would refer to as West's toxication,
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:55.980]   that is this civilization of the West
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:02:00.780]   that has brought with it all the modernity
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:03.020]   that we see around ourselves,
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:07.940]   has enormous sinister features into it.
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:12.900]   And it has taken away from us our authenticity.
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:15.980]   That was the thing, that there is something authentic
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:17.980]   that should be protected.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:22.980]   And therefore, a man in that kind of a garb and appearance
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:28.540]   seemed as a source for return to this originality
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:33.580]   of their own culture, authenticity of their own culture.
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:38.580]   And he perfectly took advantage of that, that is Khomeini,
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:44.460]   took advantage of it and the secularity
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.100]   at the expense of everybody else,
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:52.060]   which he managed in the course of 1979 to 1989,
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:55.380]   which he passed away, he died in the 10 years
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:59.180]   during this period, managed to basically transform
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:06.100]   the Iranian society to create institutions
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.740]   of the Islamic Republic
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:12.420]   and to acquire himself the position
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:15.800]   of the guardian jurist.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.640]   That was something completely new,
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.700]   it didn't ever exist before.
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.880]   As a matter of fact, as you might know,
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.440]   the model of government that a religious establishment
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.080]   takes over the states is unprecedented
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:35.560]   throughout the course of Iranian history,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.760]   throughout the course of the Islamic history, I would say.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.760]   This is the first example, and probably the only example
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:49.080]   of a regime that the religious establishment
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.780]   that has always, in the course of Iranian history,
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:55.900]   ever since I would say probably at this 16th century,
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:00.900]   if not earlier, has been always separate from the state
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:07.400]   and always kind of collaborating with the state
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:10.040]   with certain tensions in between the two of them.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.280]   They were two, basically as they would call themselves,
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:16.680]   the two pillars of stability in the society.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.360]   That situation changed.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.760]   For the first time, the religious establishment
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.280]   took over the power of the state,
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:28.840]   and that's at the core of what we see today
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:33.180]   as a major issue for Iranian society,
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:37.080]   because these are basically that old balance
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:40.160]   between the religion and the state,
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:44.080]   which was kind of a de facto separation
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:48.800]   of the authorities of the two, has been violated.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.800]   And now you have in power a theocracy in effect,
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:59.280]   which of course only in its appearance is theocracy.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.600]   Deep down, it's a, in my opinion,
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.000]   it's a brutal fascist regime that stays in power,
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.480]   but it has the appearance of religion into it.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:13.120]   So this is really the story of the revolution.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:16.100]   And as a result of that,
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:18.760]   the Iranian middle class has greatly suffered.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.980]   It's not without a reason
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:23.040]   that you see four million Iranians abroad,
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.960]   because basically the emergence of this new power
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.960]   gradually isolated or marginalized
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.200]   the secular middle class,
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:38.360]   who could not survive under that regime,
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:43.360]   and gradually moved out in the course of perhaps 30, 40 years
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:48.400]   Up to now, Iran has the largest,
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.080]   I think I'm right to say so,
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:55.040]   has the largest brain drain in any country in the world,
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.280]   - So-- - in relation to its population.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:59.720]   - So fascinating that,
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:02.800]   how much of a weird quirk of history is it
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.800]   that religion would take hold in a country?
[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.600]   Like, does it have to do with the individual?
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   It seems like if we re-ran the 20th century a thousand times
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:25.840]   we would get the '79 revolution resulting in Islamic law
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:31.920]   like less than 1% of the time, it feels like, or no.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:33.560]   Which percentage would you put on that?
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:37.840]   - Well, I think it has something to do
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:42.840]   with the very complex nature of how Iran evolved
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.680]   over a long period of time, since the 16th century.
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:51.520]   That's why, if I would for a moment
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.460]   talk about what I have written,
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:57.840]   I've written a book that's called "Iran, a Modern History,"
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.600]   and it does not start in the 20th century.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.200]   It starts in the 16th century.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.040]   - Yeah.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.000]   - Because that's what I've argued,
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000]   that this complex process that at the end of today
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.360]   resulted in what we see around us today
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.640]   is something that was in making for a very long time.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:17.360]   - And religion was a big part of it.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.200]   - Yes.
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.360]   - She and the Messiah complex.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.720]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.000]   - The longing for this great vision of a great nation
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000]   that somehow is a sublime nation
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000]   that can only be fully sublime through religion.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.520]   - Or at the time, it was thought that it's through religion.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:46.520]   Ever since then, it's disillusionment with that image,
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:49.300]   or at least a process of disillusionment.
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:52.040]   The outcome of it is what we see today.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:55.000]   Basically, that process of 40 years
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.720]   is a process of readjusting to the realities of the world.
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:04.720]   That great moment of romantic success of a revolution,
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:08.480]   like most revolutions, of course,
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.480]   that is going to change Iran
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.760]   and bring this kind of a moment of greatness
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.880]   led into this great disappointment.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:19.440]   So it's a movement of the great disappointment in a sense.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.720]   Like most Messianic movements, by the way,
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:23.200]   Messianic movements in general
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:26.480]   are always leading into great disappointment.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:31.480]   But what I have here that perhaps should be added to it,
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:37.080]   that yes, it was a peculiarity of Iran as a society
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:44.080]   that had to experience this eventual encounter
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.280]   between religion and state.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:51.120]   That's something to do with the nature of Shi'ism.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.240]   That's just one point that should be pointed out.
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.440]   Most of Sunni Islam don't have that kind of,
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:00.080]   I say most because there is something there,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.140]   but Sunni Islam in general does not have
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.440]   that kind of an aspiration
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:10.440]   for the coming of a Messianic leader.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:13.920]   Shi'ism does.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.080]   Shi'ism in its very shaping,
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:21.740]   particularly the way that it was set up in Iran,
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.040]   was a religion that has always this element
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:31.040]   of expectation to it for the coming of this Messianic leader.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.200]   Of course, I mean, between parentheses,
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.040]   all societies look for Messianic leaders.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:42.560]   I mean, just look around us.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:45.160]   - But some societies more than others.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.000]   There's certain culture, it might have to do
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.400]   with the romantic poetry that we mentioned earlier.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.520]   (laughing)
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.520]   I mean, surely, I mean, not to draw too many parallels,
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:59.080]   but with the Soviet Union, there was romanticism too.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.560]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:03.580]   It does maybe idealism.
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:09.520]   - A sense of a savior who would bring you
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.560]   out of the misery that you are in.
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:19.520]   And always looking for a third party
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.320]   to solve your issues.
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.560]   That's why probably this movement
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:29.440]   has a particular significance,
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:33.080]   because it probably doesn't look for a Messiah.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.920]   Although, I was talking to my brother,
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.280]   who is a historian also, and he was saying,
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.220]   perhaps the Messiah of this movement is that Mahsa Amini,
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:45.880]   the 22-year-old girl that was killed.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.880]   It's a martyred Messiah who is now leading a movement
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.880]   which no longer has that charismatic leadership with it.
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:02.400]   But yes, I would say that Iran has been the birthplace,
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.360]   if I might say that, of Messianic aspirations,
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.520]   going back to ancient Zoroastrianism,
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:16.560]   which is really the whole system that you see
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.040]   in major religions, or at least so-called Western religions,
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:26.040]   so Abrahamic religions, is parallel,
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:29.800]   or perhaps influenced, by Zoroastrianism,
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.160]   in which there is an idea of this world
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.400]   and the other world, there is a hereafter.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.800]   There is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:44.160]   And there is a concept that there is a moment of justice
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:48.940]   that is going to come with the rise of a religious
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.320]   or a charismatic figure.
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.960]   So it's a very old phenomenon in Iran, very old.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.720]   And it's time and again repeated itself
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.760]   in the course of its history, but never as powerfully
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.120]   as it happened in 1979, and never in the form
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:10.600]   of authority from within the religious establishment.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:13.720]   It was always the dissent movements
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:17.440]   that were kind of antinomian.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.120]   They were against the authority
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.000]   of the religious establishment.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.800]   That changed in the 20th century.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.880]   - But the revolution in 1979,
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:29.040]   that change is still with us today.
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:35.000]   Can we just linger on, are there some practical,
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.560]   games of power that occurred, you know,
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.120]   in the way that Stalin took power
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.900]   and held power in the early days?
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:48.240]   Is there something like this in terms
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.680]   of the establishment of the Revolutionary Guard
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:51.680]   and all those kinds of stuff?
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.520]   - Yes, yes.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.960]   - So the messianic figure has some support
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:58.240]   from the people, but does he have
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.280]   to crush his enemies in competition?
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:02.980]   - It certainly did.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:07.680]   Probably not, certainly not as brutal
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.120]   in terms of the victims as you would see
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:16.120]   in Soviet Union under Stalin, who the bloodshed
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:21.520]   or the destruction of the population was far greater
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.440]   than what you would find in Iran
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:28.000]   of the Islamic Republic, it's uncomparable.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.600]   Perhaps I would find a greater parallel
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:36.140]   with Mao Zedong, and particularly
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:39.720]   because China has a very strong messianic tradition
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.200]   since the ancient times, so they have something,
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.480]   and Mao appeared as a kind of a messianic figure.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:51.480]   There I can see there is a parallel,
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.640]   but also you can see with any other authoritarian regime
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:58.800]   with a messianic figure at the head of it,
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:01.720]   that it destroys all the other forces.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.080]   So during the course of the first 10 years
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:07.600]   of the Islamic Revolution, it destroyed
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.720]   the liberal nationalist secular,
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.600]   it destroyed the guerrilla movements,
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:19.760]   some of them Islamic, some of them Marxist,
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:23.760]   who turned into political parties or tendencies
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:26.840]   in the course of the post-revolution 1979.
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.320]   They were completely destroyed,
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.120]   and in a very brutal fashion.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.980]   And their opposition, even within
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:39.840]   the religious establishment, because it wasn't a uniform,
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:42.920]   there were many different tendencies,
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:45.840]   those that were opposed to the authority
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:49.260]   of Ayatollah Khomeini, or now Imam Khomeini,
[02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:53.460]   meaning almost a sacred religious figure
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:58.260]   above the level of a religious authority.
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:01.200]   He's a saint kind of a figure.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.900]   Since Shi'ism has this idea of Imams,
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:08.060]   there were 11 of them, the 12th is hidden,
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:10.340]   and would come back at the end of the time,
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:11.780]   this is a messianic figure.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:17.740]   So the title that was always used for them only in Shi'ism,
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:21.420]   never used for any other person.
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:25.740]   He is the first person in the revolution of 1979,
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:30.740]   first referred to as Deputy of Imam,
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:33.380]   but the term Deputy gradually disappeared
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:35.740]   and he became Imam Khomeini.
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:37.220]   That's his official title.
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:40.000]   - I love human beings so much.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.100]   It's so beautiful, these titles that we give each other.
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.660]   It's marvelous to observe.
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.380]   - You love it because you haven't been under that system.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:54.020]   - No, I love it in a very dark--
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:55.500]   - Dark fashion, yes.
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:57.180]   - Kind of way.
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:58.820]   It caricatures itself.
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.140]   It's almost funny in its absurdity,
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:07.240]   if not for the evil that it has led to in human history.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:10.460]   - But also the fact that it's a man,
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:14.780]   it's in fact fulfillment in a kind of completely
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:18.380]   unintended fashion.
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:21.540]   It's a fulfillment of that idea of a Messiah
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.060]   that they've been fighting for.
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:26.780]   This Imam which is in a hidden for a thousand years
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:29.240]   is here and not here.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:33.620]   And therefore Khomeini would have in a sense
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:36.300]   fulfilled those anticipations.
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.620]   But beyond that, I just give you one example.
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.100]   I know that you may have other concerns.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:44.700]   But when I say elimination,
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:47.300]   at the end of the Iran-Iraq War
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:50.540]   by the direct order of Ayatollah Khomeini,
[02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:52.620]   a fatwa that he wrote,
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.900]   a group of prisoners
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:17:00.300]   who belonged to a variety of
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:05.560]   political parties, the left, religious left,
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:09.820]   majority of them, the left,
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.940]   the Marxist left and the religious left.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:16.180]   In a matter of a few weeks, or perhaps a few months,
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.200]   I'm not actually quite sure about the time span,
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.220]   in a series of, these were people who have already
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:28.220]   been tried and they were given sentences.
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:31.660]   They were brought back before the
[02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:36.020]   summary trials of three judges,
[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:38.560]   or more, three, four of them.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:41.860]   One of them is now the
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:46.380]   new president of the Islamic Republic, Raisi.
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:52.020]   And they were given quick summary sentences
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:54.940]   which meant execution.
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:59.260]   So something between probably six to 8,000
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.860]   were executed in a matter of a month or two months,
[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:04.780]   something like that.
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.400]   Mostly in Tehran, but also in provinces.
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:13.360]   And that remained an extraordinary trauma
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.940]   for the families, for those who had these kids.
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:18.940]   They're all young, all young.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.980]   So this remains very much
[02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:28.900]   kind of original sin of the Islamic Republic
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:31.020]   that cannot get rid of.
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:33.160]   And it's in people's memories,
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.260]   they didn't allow them, even the families,
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:40.780]   to go and mourn their dead
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:44.740]   in an official symmetry which they created for them.
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:49.080]   Now the latest thing is that they put a huge
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:51.240]   concrete wall around it so nobody
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:53.180]   would be able to get into it.
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:58.180]   So these all part of this extraordinary level of,
[02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:03.920]   level of atrocity, brutality,
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:06.640]   that you see that the regime who claimed
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:11.040]   that it comes with the morality of religion and Islam
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.040]   to bring back the justice and be more,
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:21.600]   in a sense, kind to people,
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.760]   ended up with what it is in the memory
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:26.680]   of many of the people in Iran.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.040]   - So developing these fascistic tendencies.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:29.940]   - Very much so.
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.000]   Destroying minorities, Baha'is, one of them.
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:36.920]   Hundreds of Baha'is were, without any reason,
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:40.560]   without any involvement, were picked up and executed.
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:45.280]   Their properties were taken over.
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.960]   Their rights were taken away from them,
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.640]   even up to this day.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.360]   It's the largest, by the way, religious minority in Iran.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:57.840]   So you would see that in many areas,
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:02.240]   this is a, acts very much as a, beyond authoritarian.
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:04.400]   It's a kind of really a fascistic regime.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:10.540]   - So Khamenei held power for 10 years,
[02:20:10.540 --> 02:20:16.880]   and then took power, the next supreme leader,
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:20.600]   who is still the leader today, for over 30 years.
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:22.120]   Who is he?
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:26.600]   - Well, he was one of the, this is Ali Khamenei.
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:27.520]   - Ayatollah.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:29.000]   - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.160]   - Imam one day, perhaps?
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:35.160]   - No, well, they hesitated to use the term Imam for him,
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:41.040]   but in any other respect, he was given all of that adulation
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:42.520]   that they did to Khamenei.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.500]   He is the guardian jurist.
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:46.380]   That's what's important.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:48.760]   Because the guardian jurist in the Constitution
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:51.360]   of the Islamic Republic is an authority
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:54.080]   that is above the state.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:58.280]   He is not elected, quote unquote,
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.520]   because this is a divine authority,
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:05.160]   although he has been designated by the group
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.680]   of determined mullahs like himself.
[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:13.680]   And he has the full power over all institutions
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:22.720]   of the state, the army, the media, the economy,
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:28.000]   every aspect of it.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.720]   He acts like a shah.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.320]   He acts like this authoritarian authority.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:36.400]   - Did that gradually develop, or was that very early on?
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:38.640]   - Well, that's part of the Constitution
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.700]   of the Islamic Republic.
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:45.700]   The first Constitution, the first draft of the Constitution
[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:50.860]   did not have the authority of the guardian jurist.
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:55.860]   But then it was added by Khamenei and his supporters.
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.760]   - Is there actually in the Constitution
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.400]   any limits to his power?
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:06.360]   - Yes, there is a council of the experts, so to say,
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:11.720]   that would remove him from power, I think theoretically.
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:17.720]   But there is so much restrictions to that
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:20.000]   that I don't think it would have ever happened
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.840]   in reality, in his case, at least.
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:24.760]   - But in terms of executive to make decisions
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:25.880]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.880]   does he need to check with anybody?
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:28.720]   - No.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:34.520]   He does check with his own advisors,
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:39.520]   but he doesn't have any constitutional obligation
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:45.460]   to check on the decisions that he's making.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.680]   - So that's the supreme leader,
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:50.360]   but there's been presidents.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:51.200]   - Yes.
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.920]   - And what's the role of the president?
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:56.520]   - The president, in a sense, is the executive power
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:01.260]   under the Islamic Republic.
[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:05.360]   There are three heads of powers.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:09.600]   There is the president that presumably
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.440]   has the executive power.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:16.160]   There is the head of the judiciary,
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.360]   and there is the head of the,
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:23.760]   the speaker of the parliament, majlis,
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:28.760]   Islamic majlis, which is the legislative.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:34.200]   So there's the legislative, judiciary, and executive.
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:38.380]   Raisi, who is not a president,
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:41.560]   is the head of the executive.
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:45.160]   Above them is the supreme leader,
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.320]   or the guardian jurist.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:49.080]   - Can you give me some insight,
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:54.080]   because I especially, I'm not exactly sure why,
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.160]   but the president, Ahmadinejad,
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:03.660]   is somebody I'm, as an American, really familiar with.
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:05.060]   Why is that exactly?
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:10.060]   But why was the president the public-facing person
[02:24:10.060 --> 02:24:14.000]   to the world versus the supreme leader?
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.600]   Is that just an accident of a particular humans involved,
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:19.120]   or is this by design?
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:22.040]   - No, because the supreme leader tries to keep himself
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:27.040]   out of issues of everyday politics, supposedly.
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:31.320]   But therefore, he is not coming to the United Nations
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.760]   to give a speech during the session.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:40.320]   But Mr. Ahmadinejad, who at the time was the president,
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:46.200]   would come and make outrageous statements.
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:48.560]   That's why you probably know something about him.
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:50.500]   - So all of them make public statements,
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:53.560]   but he had a proclivity for outrageous statements.
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.240]   (laughing)
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.640]   - He does all kinds of things.
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:00.100]   He makes all kinds of statements.
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:05.100]   But he is somewhat above the everyday politics, in theory.
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:09.080]   But of course, he's pulling all the strings,
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:12.320]   without doubt, in every respect.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:15.000]   And it seems that you were asking,
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.840]   I thought you were going to ask me this question,
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.640]   almost without an exception,
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:27.520]   since the inception of the Islamic Republic in 1979,
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.120]   up to the last of the presidents of the Islamic Republic,
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:35.280]   Rouhani, before the guy that is last year,
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:39.860]   or a year and a half ago, was in a phony election,
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:44.060]   got into the position of the president.
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:48.140]   All of them, and it's a long list,
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:53.040]   all of them eventually fell out with the regime.
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:57.300]   So there is no president,
[02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:59.380]   except perhaps to some extent Rouhani,
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:02.620]   but we'll wait and see what's going to happen to him.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:06.420]   But prior to him, all of them, including Ahmadinejad,
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:09.380]   fell out with the regime, with the current regime in Iran.
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:10.460]   - Who's Rouhani?
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:12.660]   He was officially president for eight years.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:15.060]   - Yeah, prior to Raisi.
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:17.900]   - Ibrahim Raisi, the 221,
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:19.820]   what you're saying is a phony election.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.980]   - Yes, it's a phony election.
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:21.820]   - What happened?
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.820]   What's interesting, what happened?
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:28.740]   - Because the process of actually candidacy
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:33.220]   for presidency is completely controlled
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:36.620]   by a council that is under the control
[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:40.200]   of the supreme leader.
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:45.200]   So they have to approve who is going to be the candidate.
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:49.840]   So not everybody can enter and say,
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.040]   "I would like to be a candidate."
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:54.400]   - So did Rouhani fall out of favor?
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:55.480]   You're saying there's some--
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:59.320]   - Well, he is kind of out of favor now,
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.040]   because he was more moderate than this most recent regime.
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.740]   But the point is that if you look,
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:12.560]   this is something almost institutional,
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:14.840]   constitutional to the regime.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.840]   This is a regime that rejects all of the executive powers,
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:24.640]   because the division between the supreme authority,
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:27.480]   as the place of a supreme authority,
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.220]   versus the presidency, is problematic.
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:38.880]   It is as if there would be a supreme leader
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:43.060]   in the United States above all the three sources of power.
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:48.100]   That's the kind of view that you can see in today's Iran.
[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:52.180]   And of course, he's at the focus of all the criticism
[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:57.080]   that he receives from the demonstrators in today's Iran.
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:03.700]   - So on top of all this, recently,
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:05.660]   and throughout the last several years,
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:10.660]   US and Iran are in the midst of nuclear deal negotiations.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:14.060]   This is another part of the story of Iran,
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:19.900]   is the development of nuclear weapons, the nuclear program.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:22.700]   They're looking to restore the nuclear deal
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:27.080]   known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA.
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:31.340]   What is the history, the present, and the future
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:34.700]   of these negotiations over nuclear weapons?
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:37.340]   What is interesting to you in this full context
[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:41.340]   from the 16th century of the messianic journey?
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:46.020]   What's interesting to you here?
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:51.020]   - You can argue that for a long time, even under the Shah,
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:56.380]   but much more expressively and decisively,
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:01.760]   under the Islamic Republic, there was a determination
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:06.760]   to have a nuclear power or nuclear weapon, in a sense.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:13.760]   I think the bottom line of all the negotiations,
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.160]   everything else, is that Iran, of the Islamic Republic,
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:23.160]   had the tendency of having its own nuclear weapon.
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.000]   The reason for that is that Iran was subject
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.720]   of nearly nine years, eight and a half years,
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:35.720]   of Iran-Iraq war, when not only Iran faced an aggressor,
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:43.900]   Iraq, that actually attacked Iran at a very critical time,
[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:46.700]   at the very beginning of the Iranian Revolution,
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:52.600]   but the fact that Iran felt kind of a helpless,
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:57.760]   in the course of this war, and has to make great sacrifices,
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:01.760]   actually, which supported the Islamic regime,
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:06.760]   and consolidated the Islamic regime, because of this war.
[02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:11.820]   And most of the time, their support of the United States
[02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:16.700]   was behind Iraq vis-a-vis Iran.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:22.160]   And Iran felt that it's been isolated
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:25.160]   and has to protect itself.
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:30.160]   So there is some argument for having nuclear capabilities.
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:38.040]   But in reality, this has resulted in a completely
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:43.040]   mindless, crazy, wasteful attempt on the side
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:49.820]   of the Iranian regime to try to develop a nuclear power.
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.200]   And therefore, the rest of the world,
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:57.320]   particularly in this region, were very worried
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:02.320]   that if Iran would get access to a nuclear weapon,
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:07.040]   then the entire region of the Persian Gulf might,
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:12.040]   particularly Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey, possibly Egypt,
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:17.200]   all of them may require, may demand to have
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.720]   also nuclear weapon, given the fact that Pakistan
[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:22.680]   and India already have it.
[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:27.860]   So there was a determined attempt, as you might know,
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:30.200]   on the side of the Western communities,
[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:33.960]   or now gradually world communities, to try to,
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:38.960]   as much as possible, to control Iran from getting access
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:43.840]   to a nuclear capability, or actually limit Iran's
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:48.180]   nuclear capabilities, to what was defined usually
[02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:52.240]   in a euphemism as a peaceful fashion, okay?
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:57.020]   That being said, there was also Israel,
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:32:03.600]   which viewed the Islamic Republic as a arch enemy.
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:10.000]   And some of it might be due to the Israelis' own
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.000]   exaggeration of Iran's threat, and some of it is
[02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:20.440]   because Iran has developed a fairly strong military,
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:21.960]   as we see today.
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:28.360]   And as such, this attempt to try to prevent Iran
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:33.360]   from ever getting access to a nuclear weapon,
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:38.200]   which resulted, as you might know, in these massive
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:43.600]   sanctions that were imposed upon Iran,
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:47.800]   ever since the beginning of the revolution in 1979,
[02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:52.800]   and of course more intensively since 2015, 2016,
[02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:56.400]   even prior to that, probably a little bit earlier.
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:02.000]   This agreement, the nuclear agreement, was supposed
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:07.000]   to control or monitor Iranian nuclear industry,
[02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:13.780]   or nuclear setup, in exchange for removing the sanctions.
[02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:20.500]   But this never worked, as a matter of fact,
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:25.500]   in a very successful, satisfactory way for the Iranians,
[02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:30.800]   or for the Americans, particularly under Trump
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:35.300]   administration, which I think foolishly decided
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:39.780]   to scrap the agreement that was reached
[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:41.880]   under President Obama.
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:45.340]   Like many other policies that was implemented
[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:50.100]   under Trump administration, this created a major problem.
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:55.100]   That is, how to, under Biden, how to try to come up
[02:33:55.100 --> 02:34:01.380]   with a new nuclear agreement with Iran.
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:07.340]   In this process, since 2016, where the United States
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:12.380]   withdrew from the agreement, Iran felt comfortable
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:16.820]   to try to go and do whatever they want,
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:19.940]   without any kind of monitor, being monitored
[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:21.680]   by the international community.
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:25.440]   And that's the situation now.
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:30.100]   We don't know whether Iran is really sincere
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:35.100]   under the present regime to negotiate a deal.
[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:40.340]   We don't know that every United States is willing to do so.
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:46.320]   And it seems that now, what is happening in terms
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:49.220]   of the protests in the Iranian streets,
[02:34:49.220 --> 02:34:54.220]   makes it even harder in public eye to try to negotiate
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:01.900]   a deal with Iran, because that means in the minds of many,
[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:08.500]   and with some justification, that if the nuclear agreement
[02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:16.380]   would result in the removal of many of these sanctions,
[02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:21.380]   millions, billions, as the result of the removal
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:26.340]   of the sanctions and Iran's ability to sell it,
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:28.420]   it's oil in the international market
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:33.420]   without any restrictions, means that the Iranian government
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.640]   is going to become even more powerful,
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:41.980]   more financially secure, in order to suppress
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:43.460]   its own people.
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:48.460]   So that's the agreement that goes against coming to terms
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:52.180]   with Iran.
[02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:57.180]   But the problem is that there is no clear alternative,
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:00.620]   even I'm not particularly personally favorable
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:05.340]   for this agreement to be ratified.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:07.820]   But the alternative is very difficult.
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:11.200]   There's no way to try to see what can be done.
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:17.480]   - Geopolitics where every alternative is terrible.
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:23.780]   Let me ask you about one of the most complex
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:26.800]   geopolitical situations in history.
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:33.000]   One aspect of it is the Cold War between Iran and Israel.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.700]   The bigger picture of it is sometimes referred to
[02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:39.280]   as Israel-Palestine conflict.
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:46.140]   What are all the parties, nations involved?
[02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:48.620]   What are the interests that are involved?
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:49.900]   What's the rhetoric?
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:55.580]   Can you understand, make the case for each side
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:56.740]   of this conflict?
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:37:02.260]   - You're opening a new can of worms that takes
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:05.860]   another three hours of conversation.
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:07.660]   - Just three hours?
[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:09.340]   - At least.
[02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:11.940]   What I can tell you is this.
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:19.220]   Iran prior to 1979 viewed itself under the Shah
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:25.380]   as a kind of a, if not supporter of Israel,
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:29.380]   was in very good terms with Israel.
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:33.540]   They had an embassy in Iran, or unofficial embassy in Iran.
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:35.980]   They had certain projects that's helping
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.100]   with the agriculture and so forth in Iran.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:44.420]   But since 1979, that completely reversed.
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:52.100]   Part of it is that the issue of the Palestinian plight
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:57.340]   remained very much at the heart of the revolutionary
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:02.940]   Iranians who would see that part of the United States
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:08.940]   is to support, part of the United States guilt, sin,
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:14.580]   is to support Israel vis-a-vis its very suppressive,
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:22.380]   very oppressive treatment of the Palestinians,
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:29.620]   completely illegal taking over of the territories
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:32.760]   which is not theirs since 1967.
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.460]   And therefore it is upon the Iranian regime,
[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:40.860]   Iranian Islamic Republic, to support
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:43.460]   the cause of the Palestinians.
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:48.460]   This came about at a time when the rest of the support
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:54.040]   for the Palestinians, including Arab nationalism,
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.580]   basically reached a stage of bankruptcy.
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:02.380]   I mean, much of the regimes of the Arab world
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.540]   either are now coming to terms with Israel,
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:09.460]   or in one way or another, because of their own contingencies,
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:14.060]   because of their own concerns and interests,
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:19.060]   are willy-nilly accepting Israel in the region.
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:25.980]   Now, that old task of rhetorically supporting
[02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:29.460]   the Palestinians falls upon the Islamic Republic
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:34.580]   that sees itself as a champion of the Palestinians now.
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:38.140]   Without, as a matter of fact, having either the support
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:39.940]   of the Iranian people behind him.
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:43.620]   If you ask, if tomorrow there would be a poll
[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:47.620]   or a referendum, I would doubt that 80%
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:52.820]   of the Iranian people would approve of the policies
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:55.960]   of the Islamic Republic vis-a-vis the issue of Palestine.
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.460]   Nor the Palestinians themselves,
[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:04.340]   because the Islamic Republic's only supporting
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:08.500]   those factions within the Palestinian movement
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:12.540]   which are Islamic, quote-unquote.
[02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:15.180]   And even within that, there is problems
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:17.740]   with Hamas, for instance.
[02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:21.700]   But nevertheless, it's for the Islamic Republic
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:26.260]   some kind of a propaganda tool to be able to use it
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:31.260]   for its own sake, and claim that we are the champions
[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:34.220]   of the Palestinian people.
[02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:39.220]   Whether they have a solution, if you look at the rhetoric,
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:42.460]   if you listen to the rhetoric, it's the destruction
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:46.080]   of the state of Israel.
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:51.080]   And that, it seems to me, creates a certain anxiety
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:57.020]   in the minds of the Israelis, Israeli population,
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:58.820]   and Israeli government.
[02:40:58.820 --> 02:41:02.620]   Particularly those who are now in power.
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:07.620]   Netanyahu, the Likud, and more kind of a right-wing politics
[02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:12.840]   of, polity of today's Israel.
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:19.460]   That being said, I think also the Israelis try
[02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:24.460]   to get an extra mileage out of threat of Iran, quote-unquote,
[02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:32.780]   in order to present themselves rightful
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:38.540]   for terms of security and whatever else.
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:40.900]   The way that they're treating the Palestinians,
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:43.380]   which I think is extremely unjust.
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:47.860]   I think it's extremely unwise for Israel
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:50.420]   to carry on with these policies as they did
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:53.940]   since '67 at least, and not to try
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:55.300]   to come to terms with it.
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:57.620]   Of course, there are huge amount of,
[02:41:57.620 --> 02:41:59.580]   I'm not denying that at all,
[02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:04.580]   there's a huge amount of failures, mistakes,
[02:42:04.580 --> 02:42:12.300]   and stupidity on the side of the Palestinian leadership
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:14.480]   in various stages.
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:19.480]   Not to try to make a deal, or try to come to terms
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:24.260]   in some fashion, but it's a very complex picture,
[02:42:24.260 --> 02:42:27.900]   and it's rather unfair to the Palestinians
[02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:32.340]   to accuse them for not coming to terms with Israel
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:36.080]   under a very uneven circumstances,
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:41.080]   when they are not in a position to try to make a fair deal
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:46.140]   in terms of the territories, or in terms of their security
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:48.260]   in future vis-a-vis Israel.
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:50.900]   - So I think there's, as you probably know,
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:53.460]   quite a lot of people that would have
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.100]   a different perspective than you just stated,
[02:42:56.100 --> 02:43:01.100]   in terms of taking the perspective of Israel
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:04.860]   and characterizing the situation.
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:07.700]   Can you steelman their side?
[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.740]   Can you steelman Israel's side,
[02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:13.060]   that they're trying to be a sovereign nation,
[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:16.620]   trying to protect themselves against threats,
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:21.620]   ultimately wanting to create a place of safety,
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:25.940]   a place where people can pursue all the things
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:27.540]   that you want to pursue in life,
[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:30.860]   including foremost, happiness?
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:32.940]   - I tend to agree with you,
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:35.100]   and I have all the respect for the fact
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:39.300]   that Israel would like to create security
[02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:41.300]   and happiness for its own people.
[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:43.580]   But there are two arguments.
[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.860]   One is a moral argument.
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:47.900]   To my mind as a historian,
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:53.700]   Jews across, around the world,
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:56.040]   for all through their history, suffered.
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.380]   And this is a history of suffering.
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:01.860]   It's a history, memory of suffering.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:05.460]   And I find it enormously difficult to believe
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:10.460]   that a nation that's the product of so much sacrifice,
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:15.820]   suffering, loss of life,
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:22.020]   and variety of Holocaust above all,
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:25.980]   would find itself in a position
[02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:28.860]   not to give the proper justice
[02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:31.280]   to a people who could be their neighbors.
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:35.820]   And that is a moral argument,
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:39.340]   which I cannot believe under any circumstances
[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:40.620]   can be accepted.
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:43.500]   Second, in real terms,
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:47.820]   what do you want to, you want to commit a genocide?
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.380]   Do you have a population there
[02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:52.820]   that you have to come to terms with it?
[02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:56.700]   And you cannot just postpone as they did.
[02:44:56.700 --> 02:44:58.700]   Since '67, they are postponing
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:01.720]   and hoping that it goes away somehow.
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:05.400]   I don't think it's going to go away.
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:11.500]   And it's going to get worse rather than better.
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.300]   - It's a long, nuanced discussion,
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:15.660]   and I look forward to having it.
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:20.660]   So we'll just leave it there for the moment.
[02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:27.780]   But it is a stressful place in the world
[02:45:27.780 --> 02:45:33.100]   where the rhetoric is existential,
[02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:37.540]   where Iran makes claims that it wants to wipe
[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:40.180]   a country off the face of the earth.
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.740]   It's just the level of intensity of rhetoric
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.820]   is unlike anywhere else in the world.
[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.740]   - And extremely dangerous.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.340]   - And in both directions.
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:54.220]   So one, the real danger of the rhetoric
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:56.980]   actually being acted upon,
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:01.220]   and then the extreme political parties
[02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:06.220]   using the rhetoric to justify even a greater escalation.
[02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:12.900]   So if Iran is saying that this is,
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:16.660]   saying that they're wanting to wipe Israel
[02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:20.900]   off the face of the earth, that justifies any response.
[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:22.920]   - On the other side.
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:23.980]   - On the other side.
[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:26.500]   - Of course, I tend to agree with you fully.
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:29.540]   And unfortunately, this is a very critical situation
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:34.540]   that this region is facing, Iran in particular.
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:40.220]   I would say that, I hope that in the minds
[02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:45.260]   of the people of Israel, there is enough or common sense
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:54.340]   to realize that probably escalation on the Israeli side
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:56.300]   is not in the favor of anybody.
[02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:00.300]   And try to let the Iranians to go on
[02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:05.300]   with their empty rhetoric as they do so far.
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:11.020]   But at the same time, I cannot deny the fact
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:16.020]   that there is a danger on the side of this regime
[02:47:16.020 --> 02:47:18.120]   and what it says.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:20.740]   It cannot be denied, nobody can justify that.
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:25.020]   Particularly because the Iranian population
[02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:27.960]   is not behind this regime.
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:30.600]   Certainly in the case of the Palestinians.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:33.220]   Or for that matter, it's not Palestine.
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:38.220]   It's the Islamic Republic's involvement in Lebanon
[02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:43.140]   with Hezbollah, it's the Islamic Republic's involvement
[02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:46.900]   in Syria with Bashar Assad, it's involvement
[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:49.880]   in other parts of the world, perhaps even Yemen.
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:55.860]   That all of them creates extraterritorial responsibilities
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:48:02.260]   or interventions, unnecessary interventions
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:08.100]   that ultimately is not in favor of best interests
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:11.620]   of the Iranian people or Iran as a country.
[02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:14.900]   Iran has never been involved in this kind of politics
[02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:17.680]   before of the Islamic Republic.
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:22.140]   So in a sense, the Iranian regime, it seems to me,
[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:26.020]   by going to the extreme, try to create for itself
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:32.000]   a space that it did not exist before.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.080]   Did not have or did not deserve to have
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:37.400]   within the politics of the region.
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:43.520]   So in other words, that has become part of the tool,
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:47.280]   a kind of an instrument for, if you like to call it
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.480]   some kind of an expansionism of the regime.
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.980]   In parts of the world where it can see
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:49:00.240]   there is a possibility for its presence,
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.560]   for its expansion.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:05.520]   Of course, historically speaking,
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:08.960]   Iran ever since 15th century,
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.260]   I think that's the earliest example I can see,
[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:16.200]   in early modern times, has always a tendency
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:20.400]   of moving in the direction of not only what is today
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:25.120]   the state of Iraq, but further into the eastern coast
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:26.580]   of Mediterranean.
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:31.580]   So that's a long-term ambition that has been in the cards
[02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:37.020]   as far as Iran as a strategic unit is concerned.
[02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:40.880]   But by no means justified and by no means
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:44.880]   could be a reasonable, could be a sane policy
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:49.880]   of a nation state as today's Iran.
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:53.960]   But the second point is that also
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:59.540]   regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric.
[02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:05.600]   So it's, once you keep repeating something,
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:10.280]   then you become more and more committed to it.
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.800]   And it cannot remain anymore in the level of a rhetoric.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.920]   You have to do something about it.
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:20.400]   So it's a compelling pressure to try to
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.980]   materialize what you've been saying in your rhetoric.
[02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:29.780]   And that is even extremely more dangerous
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:33.700]   as far as Iran is concerned.
[02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:38.700]   And it brings it to some unholy alliances
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:43.660]   that today we are witnessing Iran is getting involved.
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:47.220]   Even more dangerous than this rhetoric
[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:52.220]   in terms of the, vis-a-vis Israel,
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:54.840]   is its involvement with Russia
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:58.760]   and to some extent with China, which we can't talk about.
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:00.780]   - What do you think about the meeting
[02:51:00.780 --> 02:51:03.640]   between Khamenei and Vladimir Putin in July?
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:06.500]   What's that alliance?
[02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:08.520]   What's that partnership?
[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:10.640]   Is it surface-level geopolitics
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:12.840]   or is there a deep, growing connection?
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:17.180]   - I cannot see the difference between geopolitics
[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:18.660]   and these deep connections.
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:20.980]   I see it's one and the same.
[02:51:20.980 --> 02:51:22.400]   Why?
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:27.060]   Because I think the experience of 40 years
[02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.820]   of distancing from the West
[02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:33.380]   in terms of the Islamic Republic.
[02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:39.540]   And the fact that there is a shelf life
[02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:44.540]   to imperial presence for any empire anywhere in the world.
[02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:51.300]   So after the terrible experience of the United States
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:57.180]   in Iraq and in Afghanistan,
[02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:02.580]   pretty much like the British empire,
[02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.980]   that after the Suez experience in '56,
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:10.980]   decided to withdraw from east of Suez,
[02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:16.420]   maybe there is a moment here that we are witnessing,
[02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:19.820]   or it may come, that a great power
[02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:22.940]   like the United States sees in its benefit
[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:26.500]   not to get too much involved into nitty-gritty things
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.340]   in other parts of the world,
[02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:30.740]   that it's not its immediate concern.
[02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:36.540]   And I think that is part of the reason,
[02:52:36.540 --> 02:52:38.220]   not the entire reason,
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:41.020]   part of the reason why we see the emergence
[02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:46.020]   of a new geopolitical environment
[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:49.580]   in this part of the world,
[02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:54.580]   of which China, Russia, possibly Iran,
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:59.020]   possibly Turkey, possibly both of them,
[02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:00.320]   are going to be part.
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:06.580]   Perhaps Saudis also, but I doubt that the Saudis
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:08.740]   under the present circumstances,
[02:53:08.740 --> 02:53:12.540]   although we've witnessed some remarkable issue
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:15.420]   in the course of the past few weeks,
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:18.100]   where the Saudis giving assurances
[02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:21.780]   to American administration and then shifting
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:24.840]   and getting along with Putin,
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:26.780]   in terms of the oil production,
[02:53:26.780 --> 02:53:28.460]   I think it's more than that even.
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:30.140]   And it's not only them,
[02:53:30.140 --> 02:53:32.820]   but also the Emirates are doing the same thing.
[02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:34.340]   So what does that just tell us?
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:37.020]   - And that's another many-hour conversation
[02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:42.020]   about the oil industry in Iran and the whole region.
[02:53:42.020 --> 02:53:45.780]   - In emerging this kind of a world,
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:50.420]   which was perhaps even 10 years ago unimaginable,
[02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:54.500]   that you see now a great power, China,
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:59.460]   that it's going to remain from what we see around us
[02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:00.760]   as a great power,
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:06.220]   and Russia, adventurous,
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:10.540]   foolish, but nevertheless would remain criminal,
[02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:16.980]   I would say, as far as its behavior in Ukraine.
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:20.420]   But actually, it's a rogue nation
[02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:23.040]   that attracts another rogue nation.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:28.040]   So Iran finds itself now in a greater place of security
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:32.500]   in alliance with Russia,
[02:54:32.500 --> 02:54:37.380]   in the hope that this would give Iran a greater security
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:39.740]   in this part of the world.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:44.740]   Whether this is realistic or an illusion,
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:48.420]   I think remains to be seen.
[02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:51.800]   I think Iran-China relation makes more sense.
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:56.840]   Although, if you ask ordinary Iranians,
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:54:58.880]   they don't like it.
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:02.700]   They would tell, "Why should we be tied up
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:09.840]   "with China as the only trade party with America,
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.780]   "because of the foolish isolations
[02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:15.620]   "that you have created for us,
[02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:18.740]   "because of all the sanctions that you have created for us,
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:20.940]   "the Islamic Republic?"
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:24.940]   So in a sense, it's a very difficult question to answer.
[02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:28.580]   Probably Iranians also like to be more on the other camp.
[02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:32.540]   But what happens is that in real term,
[02:55:32.540 --> 02:55:37.540]   what surprises me most is not this alliance with China,
[02:55:37.540 --> 02:55:43.540]   but it's kind of becoming a lackey or subservient
[02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:49.660]   to Putin's regime in Russia.
[02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:52.380]   Since if you look at it,
[02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:57.860]   Iran, ever since at least the 19th century,
[02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:00.020]   not going further back,
[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:02.300]   the beginning of the 19th century,
[02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:07.300]   always viewed Russia as the greatest threat strategically,
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:10.480]   because it was sitting right at the top of Iran.
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:17.860]   It was infinitely more powerful than Iran has ever been.
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:23.420]   And Iran fought two rounds of war
[02:56:23.420 --> 02:56:25.620]   at the beginning of the century,
[02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:29.900]   lost the entire Caucasus to Russia,
[02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:31.340]   and learned its lesson,
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:36.840]   that you have to be mindful of Russia,
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:41.420]   and you have to keep it at arm's length.
[02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:43.740]   And that's what was Iran's policy
[02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:47.340]   throughout the course of the 20th century,
[02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:49.740]   19th and 20th century,
[02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:53.380]   up to what we see now around us,
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:55.520]   which is a very strange situation.
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:01.660]   Whether the balance has changed
[02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:07.500]   in terms of if Russia is purchasing weapons
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:12.260]   from Iran, which was unheard of,
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:18.180]   it means that there is a new balance is emerging,
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:20.460]   a new relationship is emerging.
[02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:24.060]   Perhaps remains to be seen.
[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:29.060]   But if you look at the historical precedence,
[02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:33.700]   it would have been enormously unwise
[02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:38.140]   to be an ally of Russia,
[02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:41.420]   given its long history of aggression in Iran.
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:45.220]   See, Russians, part of the reason
[02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:50.220]   why it's actually Iran allied itself with British Empire
[02:57:51.180 --> 02:57:53.100]   was the fact that it was so much afraid
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:55.200]   of the Russian expansion.
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:58:00.180]   And as such, I don't know what's going to be
[02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:02.460]   the future of this relationship.
[02:58:02.460 --> 02:58:05.060]   - There is a big disconnect
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:08.340]   between governments and the people.
[02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:10.940]   And I think ultimately, I have faith
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:14.240]   that there's a love across the different cultures,
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:18.460]   across the different religions, amongst the people.
[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:19.860]   And the governments are the source
[02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:21.900]   of the division and the conflict and the wars
[02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:25.540]   and all the geopolitics that is in part grounded
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:28.740]   in the battle for resources and all that kind of stuff.
[02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:31.260]   Nevertheless, this is the world we live in.
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:34.420]   So you looked at the modern history of Iran
[02:58:34.420 --> 02:58:36.380]   the past few centuries.
[02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:39.460]   If you look into the future of this region,
[02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:42.860]   now you kind of implied that a historian
[02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:45.260]   has a bit of a cynical view
[02:58:47.100 --> 02:58:50.100]   of protests and things like this
[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:54.460]   that are fueled, at least in the minds
[02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:56.220]   of young people, with hope.
[02:58:56.220 --> 02:58:59.180]   If you were to just for a while
[02:58:59.180 --> 02:59:01.740]   have a bit of hope in your heart and your mind,
[02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:05.020]   what is a hopeful future for the next 10, 20, 30 years
[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:05.860]   of Iran?
[02:59:05.860 --> 02:59:07.140]   - I'm not cynical.
[02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:07.980]   - Yes.
[02:59:07.980 --> 02:59:10.180]   - I try to be realistic.
[02:59:10.180 --> 02:59:12.900]   And I actually may be critical,
[02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:14.300]   but I have great hopes
[02:59:15.980 --> 02:59:19.940]   in Iran's future for a variety of reasons.
[02:59:19.940 --> 02:59:22.420]   I actually did write an article,
[02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:26.080]   only the last version of it is going to go out today,
[02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:29.140]   in which the title of it is
[02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:33.340]   The Time of Fear and Women of Hope,
[02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:37.060]   which in a sense is this whole coverage
[02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:41.060]   about what this movement means
[02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:42.900]   that we see today.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:46.660]   It may fizzle in a few weeks' time,
[02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:51.320]   or it may just go on and create a new dynamics
[02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:55.980]   in Iranian society that would hopefully result
[02:59:55.980 --> 03:00:01.940]   in a peaceful process of greater accommodation
[03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:08.020]   and a greater tolerance within the Iranian society
[03:00:08.020 --> 03:00:10.100]   and with the outside world.
[03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:14.180]   And I think majority of the Iranian people
[03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:15.640]   don't want tension,
[03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:18.660]   don't want confrontation,
[03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:22.320]   don't want crisis.
[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:27.820]   They, if 40 years they have suffered
[03:00:27.820 --> 03:00:32.420]   from a regime that have dictated an ideology
[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:37.420]   that is regressive and impractical,
[03:00:38.860 --> 03:00:41.460]   they want to go back to a life
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:45.380]   in which they don't really create trouble
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:47.500]   for their neighbors or for the world.
[03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:53.360]   And therefore, I would see a better future for Iran.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:56.220]   That's for one reason.
[03:00:56.220 --> 03:00:59.780]   Strategically or geopolitically,
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:04.780]   maybe in Iran's advantage in a peaceful fashion
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:09.660]   to negotiate as it's the fate of all the nations
[03:01:09.660 --> 03:01:12.220]   rather than commit itself
[03:01:12.220 --> 03:01:17.220]   or sworn to a particular course of policy.
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:23.340]   So there's a give and take as the nature of politics
[03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:26.740]   is art of possible, as it's been said.
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:30.140]   So probably Iran is going to be hopefully
[03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:32.060]   moving that direction.
[03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:34.520]   I think there is a generational thing.
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:35.880]   That's the third reason.
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:41.500]   No matter how much the Islamic Republic
[03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:46.220]   tried to Islamicize the Iranian society
[03:01:46.220 --> 03:01:51.220]   in its own image of kind of radical,
[03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:56.120]   ideological indoctrination, it has failed.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:01.540]   It has failed up to what we see today
[03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:03.140]   in the Iranian streets.
[03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:06.920]   And the Iranian population said no to it.
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:11.200]   And I think if there would have been,
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:13.700]   and I very much hope there will be,
[03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:17.660]   a possibility for a more open environment,
[03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:20.740]   more open space where they would be able
[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:23.380]   to speak their views out,
[03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:28.020]   Iranians are not on the side of moving
[03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:31.260]   in the extreme directions.
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:35.260]   They are on the side of greater accommodation
[03:02:35.260 --> 03:02:38.220]   and a greater interest in the outside world.
[03:02:38.220 --> 03:02:43.420]   And if you look at every aspect of today's,
[03:02:43.420 --> 03:02:46.700]   beside the government, every aspect of life
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:48.940]   in today's Iran, you can see that.
[03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:51.680]   From the way that people dress,
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:56.580]   to the way that they try to live their lives,
[03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:59.020]   to the way that they're educating themselves
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:02.260]   or educated in the institutions,
[03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:06.860]   do you see a desire, an intention to move forward?
[03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:08.400]   And I'm optimistic.
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:12.400]   - Well, in that struggle for freedom,
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:13.820]   like I told you offline,
[03:03:13.820 --> 03:03:17.580]   one of my close childhood friends is Iranian.
[03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:21.300]   Just a beautiful person, his family is a wonderful family.
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:26.020]   On a personal level, it is one of the deeper windows
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:28.080]   into the Iranian spirit and soul
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:29.460]   that I've gotten a chance to witness,
[03:03:29.460 --> 03:03:31.080]   so I really appreciate it.
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:33.820]   But in the recent times, I've gotten to hear
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:36.540]   from a lot of people that are currently living in Iran,
[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:39.660]   that currently have that burning hope
[03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:40.940]   for the future of the country.
[03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:43.700]   And so my love goes out to them
[03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:44.820]   in the struggle for freedom.
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:45.980]   I have to-- - That's so nice
[03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:47.060]   of you to say so.
[03:03:47.060 --> 03:03:49.300]   And I very much hope so.
[03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:52.700]   There are moments of despair,
[03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:55.700]   and there are moments that you would think
[03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:58.020]   that there is no hope,
[03:03:58.020 --> 03:04:03.020]   but then again, something triggers,
[03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:09.300]   and you see 100,000 people in the streets of Berlin
[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:14.500]   that are hoping for a better future for Iran.
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:17.160]   And I very much hope it eventually emerges,
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:19.100]   even I'm hoping at the same time
[03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:22.600]   there's not going to be a very strong leadership,
[03:04:22.600 --> 03:04:24.780]   as it was the case in the past.
[03:04:24.780 --> 03:04:27.920]   We started with hope, we ended with hope.
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:29.500]   This was a real honor.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:30.900]   This is an incredible conversation.
[03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:35.900]   Thank you for giving such a deep
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:40.300]   and wide story of this great nation,
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:41.980]   one of the great nations in history.
[03:04:41.980 --> 03:04:44.100]   - Well, that's very kind of you to say so.
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:45.540]   - Thank you for sitting down today.
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:48.640]   This was amazing. - Well, a history that's,
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:51.360]   as I've said in the start of my book,
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:53.300]   I say it's the history of a nation
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:57.620]   which has learned a huge amount from the outside world
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:05:00.260]   by force of its geography.
[03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:04.140]   It was always located somewhere that people would invade,
[03:05:04.140 --> 03:05:07.900]   or come for trade, or something happened to it
[03:05:07.900 --> 03:05:12.180]   that this diffused culture continued to,
[03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:15.600]   and they were not afraid of learning or adopting,
[03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:17.540]   as they do right now today.
[03:05:17.540 --> 03:05:21.220]   This is a very different society.
[03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:25.540]   - Never a boring moment in its history, as you write about.
[03:05:25.540 --> 03:05:26.740]   Thank you so much, this was awesome.
[03:05:26.740 --> 03:05:28.280]   - Thank you.
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:29.940]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:31.260]   with Abba Samanat.
