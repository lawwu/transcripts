[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   Why is kindness so important to you?
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, because at 47, it's clear to me that that's an equal variable to work ethic that's
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.880]   brought me to the place that I'm at.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.720]   And the thing that I watch and admire in others who are in similar places.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.600]   I think there's an incredibly disgusting concept in society that says nice guys finish last.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240]   I think it's an awful thing.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.280]   As a matter of fact, I really need to make a hoodie and start rocking it that says nice
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.800]   guys finish first because I really believe that because I think it's what are you judging?
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   Like cool, you made $83 million in the bank and you die and nine people show up to your
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.960]   funeral was like that good?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.000]   I would argue it's not.
