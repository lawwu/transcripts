[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.960]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.700]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.200]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.920]   how to be a digital designer.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.240]   For the majority of my career,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.720]   my focus has been on delivering
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   the best web experiences for our customers.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580]   And I do this by owning the user experience
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.800]   and design of websites for major brands,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.080]   like LinkedIn, Logitech, Cisco, Fortinet, and NetApp.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.080]   Now, when it comes to opinions
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.320]   about what good web design is,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.840]   you'll often hear someone say,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.400]   "Oh, just go make your website look like Apple."
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.040]   Now, Apple does have fantastic and stunning-looking
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.400]   marketing material and industrial product designs.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.360]   However, you as an outsider have very limited view
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   into what parts of the website actually performs well.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.120]   So just borrowing their design
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.920]   doesn't mean it'll succeed for you.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.180]   I'm a firm believer that every pixel has to have a purpose.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.660]   It doesn't matter if it's a decision
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.020]   about color or typography.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.200]   It doesn't matter if it's an illustration or photography,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   or a philosophical debate on how simple or complex
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.160]   to make a webpage because you have too much to say.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.400]   Everything you decide to put on a website
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.240]   should be done intentionally.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840]   A good web design engages a visitor,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.480]   compels them to take action
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.820]   with the least amount of clicks possible,
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.620]   and can be backed by data.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.800]   I have a huge amount of respect and love
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   for the field of digital design and user experience.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.480]   It truly is as much science as it is art.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.720]   So if you've ever considered a career in digital design,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.100]   or you're curious how to transition
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.200]   to different opportunities within the field,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.520]   then this episode is for you.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400]   Today, we're going to have a conversation
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.160]   with Janelle Chandler.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   She's the VP of creative and user experience
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.240]   at Qualified Digital.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.960]   In this video, she's going to give us practical insights
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   about topics like the differences
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360]   between UX and visual design,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.760]   tips to ensure web development builds what you designed,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.240]   and then we're going to talk about Janelle's
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.480]   own career journey and how she deals with criticism
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   and imposter syndrome.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   All right, let's get started.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.460]   Hey guys, today we're going to talk about everything
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.460]   around how to be a creative and how to be a designer.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.340]   Joining us today is Janelle Chandler.
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.700]   Janelle, how are you doing?
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.360]   - I'm good, Tim, how are you?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.620]   - I'm doing really good.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.940]   Janelle, I've always really deeply admired
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.220]   and respected how you do your craft.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.700]   Of course, quality of work and your creativity,
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.940]   your range is all there, but I think at the end of the day,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.100]   what always resonates with me is you as a human.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.020]   Like you're an empathetic individual,
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.180]   you're just cool to work with,
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.900]   and that really kind of resonates
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.660]   in your design, quite frankly.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.940]   So can you tell us a little bit about
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.980]   what you're doing right now and how long
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.340]   you've been doing it and maybe your journey
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.700]   to how you got here?
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.700]   - Yeah, so right now I work for a startup agency
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.580]   called Qualified Digital,
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.980]   and I'm VP of Creative End User Experience.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.060]   So that means like a lot of different things,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.100]   but if I kind of boil it down, like you said,
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.700]   the main part is quality of work
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.460]   that comes out of the agency.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.340]   So we do website designs, mobile app designs,
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.540]   any kind of digital experience,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.420]   and like really creating a beautiful experience
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.340]   that's meaningful.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.100]   So that's like one part.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.140]   And then the second part is I'm more,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.980]   a little more focused right now on like creating teams,
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.460]   building teams, building culture within the creative teams,
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.460]   and sort of how that kind of levels up to the business
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.540]   and how that sort of magic all happens.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.100]   - And so let's actually talk about that a little bit
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.060]   before we get to your journey,
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.260]   'cause I think building a team and what you look for
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.340]   is really important.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.700]   And quite frankly, design as a category
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.540]   is really, really broad with many applications.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.460]   And so can you maybe tell us about like the common types
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.020]   of design that you interact with
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.460]   or that you personally execute,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.540]   and then what maybe you're looking for in designers?
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.980]   They could be from early career to very senior.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.980]   - Yeah, so the type of design for this agency specifically,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.860]   it kind of boils down into user experience
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.460]   and then visual design.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.780]   And then there's like subcategories within those.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.660]   So typically they don't mix,
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.300]   but sometimes you also might have a hybrid person.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   But for user experience,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.140]   these are the type of people who,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.220]   I kind of relate it to our architecture.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.100]   They like to draw the blueprints.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.140]   They're into the requirements, the spec work,
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.380]   the functionality, like how are we going to make a plan
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.020]   to build this?
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.820]   So kind of like job titles in those would be
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.780]   like a UX researcher, a UX designer,
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.620]   sometimes product designer.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.700]   And then on the visual side, which is more my sweet spot,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.620]   you'll have your visual designers, your branding designers.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.340]   So we're more responsible for the look and feel,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.940]   the typography, the color, also the experience too.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.140]   Like when you're scrolling through a site,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.460]   do things change, do colors change?
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.660]   How is the type read?
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.780]   So those are kind of the two different groupings.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.340]   Personally where I sit is sort of in the middle.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.340]   I like to figure out the plan
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.860]   and I also like to make it feel good, come alive,
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.180]   like you're really experiencing it from start to finish.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.580]   And then I think your second question was around
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.180]   the level of talent.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.020]   So at QD, because we're so small,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.460]   we tend to right now hire like senior level designers
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.180]   and above just because the work is so in depth
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.900]   and fast paced, it's very hard to train.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.620]   But we'll hire from like a senior
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.100]   or a lead director level to VP level.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.060]   And basically that means you know how to work
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.500]   on a project from start to finish,
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.900]   your client facing, all the ins and outs.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.840]   So you're really focused on the challenge at hand
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.220]   versus the process.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.780]   You're focused on what's the best experience
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.340]   I'm making for this customer
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.980]   versus you know, like how do I get from A to B?
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.780]   You're focused on more of the challenge.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.740]   - So that's an interesting space to be hiring for
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.940]   'cause a resume can look really, really good, right?
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.020]   But you don't really know what you're gonna get
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.360]   until you see it in practice,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.740]   especially at the senior levels.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.480]   Like how long have they been away
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.540]   from doing actual hands-on work, right?
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.220]   So how do you go through and kind of process that,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.400]   evaluate a talent and the whole gamut?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.600]   - Okay, it's super hard, super hard right now too
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.920]   because like, so we're hiring too.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.240]   So the pool of talent out there ranges
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.680]   from people who are in the weeds of work
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.400]   to you know, senior talent
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.440]   who hasn't actually designed anything for years.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.080]   And also now that we're into like AI,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.040]   like we've even seen portfolios
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.340]   that are literally done by AI.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.340]   And it's like, "Hey, you're cheating now."
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.400]   (laughing)
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.580]   What we look for is well, with every creative person,
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.640]   you have to have a portfolio
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.160]   and you're not judged solely on your portfolio.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.480]   You're going to have to explain your role,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.360]   your contribution and that will determine
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   like what level you're at at the agency for us.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.920]   So if you're talking more high level,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   you orchestrated the team, you may be too senior for us.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.480]   If you orchestrated the team and you're also in the weeds,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.200]   you're in Figma, you're in, no one uses sketch anymore,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   but like you know the lingo, you know how to do things.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.680]   You're kind of on the right track for us.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   Our agency is like, no matter what your level is,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.080]   you're still gonna be the individual contributor.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.780]   And a lot of people here really like that
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.280]   because you don't lose your craft.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.780]   It's a lot of responsibility,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.360]   but you're still in the weeds with everyone else.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.040]   You're taking out the trash too.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.720]   - Yeah, I think that's a really, really good perspective.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.520]   I think, I agree with you actually,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.200]   not even just in design.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.760]   Right now, as I'm looking at roles I'm consulting,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.840]   it's very similar things.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.640]   Like you gotta walk the walk and talk the talk, right?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.120]   And then oftentimes, like even working with you,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.220]   like you lead the strategy, you kind of do the framework,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.300]   but like even for you to be able to effectively
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.240]   handle it off to someone,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.940]   like you're always creating a really high quality template
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.780]   for someone to follow.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.140]   So there really is that practical application of the job
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.400]   to make the process more efficient.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.280]   - Yeah, and we're seeing that too,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   like I'm seeing that specifically with new clients
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.640]   that we're having, even old clients that we're having,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.200]   even just the way the industry,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.940]   like design and tech is shaping.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.320]   Like back in the day, you used to have creative directors
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   who would probably spend months with you just talking vision
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.000]   and that's all they did.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.380]   And they had their team like execute.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.960]   Now that doesn't fly.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.800]   Like you have to be talking vision
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.500]   and then let's see your output
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.400]   and your output has to also be quality
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.560]   with a great team that also contributes to that.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.600]   So it's definitely changing a lot.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   - Yeah, and earlier you were talking about
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.680]   obviously leading us into all the different types
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.840]   of creative you use, like user experience, UX,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.720]   usability and design.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.840]   Now, how easy is it, not easy is the wrong word,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.120]   but how feasible is it for someone to change disciplines?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.960]   So let's say you're not at the web production level.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.200]   Let's say you are, let's say a web designer
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   or maybe you're an application design
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.720]   for software, let's say.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.840]   How easy is it to take that skill
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.480]   and translate over into web design or usability or UX?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   'Cause the disciplines are a little different, right?
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.160]   So they're a little nuanced.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.600]   - They're different mindset,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.240]   but the foundation at its core is the same.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.420]   Like, regardless of what type of designer you are,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.160]   you're creating something for a user.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.640]   Whether you're a like user experience person,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.680]   you're an advocate for the user, that's your focus.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.600]   Same thing with like visual design, motion design,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.480]   whatever it is, like you're doing this
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.400]   for the actual user to enjoy the experience.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.300]   So foundation is the same.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.520]   A lot of people do sort of either overlap
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.320]   or in different times of their career will be like,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.560]   like I know me personally, I started out visual design.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.400]   I probably did that for like six years and got sick of it.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.120]   I was like, I'm just tired
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   and switched completely over to UX.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.200]   You just pick up more skills and tools.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.140]   And then eventually I moved back to visual design
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.680]   and it was sort of a hybrid.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.840]   You can switch around, you can change.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.000]   It's actually more beneficial for the company
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.520]   and yourself to be able to speak like holistically
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   about things, but it is a different mindset.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.920]   Because you're going from like straight blueprints
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   to like, I'll speak in like architecture terms,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.680]   but like you're going from like blueprints
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.320]   to designing the interior of the house.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.240]   Different mechanics, but foundation is pretty much the same.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   - And so actually, if you don't mind,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.320]   just maybe defining it for the user,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.280]   like classical visual design versus UX,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.240]   like what's the difference?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.280]   - Yeah, so, okay, I like talking about this
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.520]   because I think we've talked a little bit.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.720]   I do a lot of mentorship for bootcampers
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.120]   and they don't know what to call themselves a lot of times.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.040]   So I define it by the deliverables at hand.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.280]   So user experience, you'll do things from personas,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:40.600]   researching audience types, wireframes.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.300]   You'll probably make like low fidelity prototypes.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.620]   You'll do user testing,
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.020]   sort of just the research aspect of it.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.360]   Visual design is all of the things that you can see,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.500]   like the pretty stuff, the fonts, the colors,
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:08.180]   sometimes the logos, the way you experience a page,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.180]   the transitions, the motion.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.180]   So it's all about the front end, the visual aspect of it.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.100]   - Yeah, I want to double down on that
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.780]   'cause I totally love what you said
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.500]   about distinguishing like UX as the blueprint foundation.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.260]   Like I'm not a designer by trade at all.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.060]   Like if anyone pays me to design,
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.460]   like they're in serious trouble.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.140]   But the principles of UX,
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.540]   like I definitely utilize
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.980]   from a web marketing strategy point of view.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.020]   Like the tools I use, you're gonna laugh,
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.540]   it used to be MS Paint drawing 16 bit colors.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.420]   And then like now I'm like using PowerPoint
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.900]   or like Google Slides, right?
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.540]   But the idea of like putting your thoughts on a paper
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.180]   in a way that conveys hierarchy of content and importance
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.020]   in lieu of design is really important.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.860]   'Cause again, that's the strategy piece of it
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.820]   where you say, hey, look, to your point earlier,
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.500]   here's the customer I'm going after.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.340]   Here's what I believe they're interested in,
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.540]   whether it's top tasks or whatnot,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.340]   organizing content in a way that you believe
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.180]   delivers on those top tasks.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.820]   And then that can be as high or low fidelity as possible.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.740]   I usually keep them as low fidelity as possible
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.580]   so people don't confuse it as design.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.820]   And even then some people have confused it as design.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.820]   I'm like, dude, if you think our website's
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.420]   gonna look like this, like we're in trouble.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.060]   Yeah, so like with the clients that you've worked with
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.500]   on the agency side, like what's the best way
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.260]   of communicating like business
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.140]   and like site user like requirements
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.580]   that kind of ends up lending itself into UX and design?
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.300]   And do you often agree with your clients
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.860]   or do you kind of lead them in a different direction?
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.860]   - Yeah, so geez, I would say majority of the time
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.540]   the clients are really focused on the business.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.860]   They have their own like goals and like KPIs
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.740]   and nine times out of 10,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.980]   it's different than what the user wants.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.620]   So it's always kind of like a battle in terms of,
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.740]   like we were just working on a navigation project
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.340]   and the client was like, this is how I see us
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.100]   laying out the products.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.340]   It made sense from a business point of view,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.140]   but to a customer, they're not gonna know the lingo.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.140]   They don't know the like code words or abbreviations.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.220]   Like it just doesn't make sense.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.620]   So there's like a few ways we kind of go about it,
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.620]   but one is really testing like, cool, you want your idea.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.060]   Like you said, we keep it low fidelity wireframes.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.420]   We'll mock it up.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.340]   Sure, this is what you requested, cool.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.060]   But this is what we recommend
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.300]   coming from a user point of view.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.620]   Like how I sort of define user experiences,
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.860]   like you are always the advocate for the user.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.580]   There's gonna be a lot of different opinions
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.380]   coming your way, block it out.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.980]   It's all about the user.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.460]   And when you put it to a test,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.580]   that's when you can kind of see like,
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.020]   does option A work, does option B work
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.580]   and let the data really speak for itself.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.140]   'Cause once you have the data, it's straight facts
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.180]   and no one has an opinion.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.820]   Once they see facts, they're like, cool,
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.500]   we'll go with option B or, you know,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.140]   whatever the sort of determination or result is.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.660]   - So you said two things there I love
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.140]   and I wanna kind of double down on them.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.420]   First one is around being an advocate of the customer.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.060]   I can't tell you how many times,
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.420]   even see on the client side where like
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.860]   the product marketing team or whomever brand,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.460]   like they have a really strong opinion
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.620]   on what they believe the customer wants.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.740]   And like, they believe they're being customer centric
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.980]   and that's probably informed by customer research
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.900]   or feedback from sales.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.500]   So there's a part of that is true,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.340]   but it's always then stuffed with what you want
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.180]   put in there, right?
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.460]   And it's kind of helping them navigate,
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.140]   kind of deciphering what truly is important to the customer,
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.420]   like the top three things as opposed to the 50.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.100]   And like global navigation, go to any website,
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.980]   you'll see like, if you wanna learn
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.820]   what a company is all about, look at global nav.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.220]   You know, I think I've worked with brands previously
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.540]   where it's like solutions and products,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.620]   they almost read the same, right?
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.740]   And so I literally did an open card sort
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.740]   and like people were confused.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.580]   Like, what am I looking at?
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.980]   So like, that's just like to your point,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.500]   data definitely speaks volumes.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.620]   Now, I do wanna ask you a question about measurement
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.460]   because again, clients will always say, I want Apple.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.300]   It's like, well, not everyone should design a website
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.140]   that looks like Apple,
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.340]   nor is it appropriate for your customer base.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.420]   But like, you don't know how a certain design element
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.820]   on Apple actually performs.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.660]   So you can't necessarily emulate that without data, right?
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.860]   And so, as you're going through and creating design,
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.460]   how do you build in the practice of testing and research
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.100]   and kind of optimizing?
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.900]   Is that part of your normal, your engagement with your client
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.620]   and are they, do they usually push back
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.460]   'cause they just wanna design something
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.300]   and they're done with it?
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.660]   Like, how do you approach that?
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.780]   - Yeah, it always depends on the client.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.940]   I would say a lot of times,
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.100]   clients want things done quickly.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.420]   They wanna see something fast.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.300]   They have a vision.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.100]   They're like, cool, you're the expert, give me feedback.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.780]   But at the same time, even what we do recommend
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.580]   is coming from a place of maybe only experience
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.980]   and not what the actual customer wants.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.740]   So there's two ways you can go about it.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.860]   The proper way is when you're in the UX phase,
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.140]   you're testing, you're iterating,
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.980]   you're getting that feedback early on.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   So when you go into design, when you go to build it,
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.620]   it's, you have all your factual data,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.260]   you have all your requirements,
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260]   you're just building it based on a spec.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.940]   That never really happens.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.940]   So what we typically do is we build through experience
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:54.020]   and sort of goals and then at the end, we test.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.060]   We'll do like A/B testing, we'll do user testing
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.820]   and then sort of refine and modify.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.620]   We got the big website out, we got the navigation out,
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.300]   we got the big push out.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   And once everyone's on the same page that it's not a,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.020]   we hit this button, it's launched, peace out.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.860]   It's an ever evolving thing.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.180]   It makes more sense.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.620]   And then now we're getting real time feedback.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.100]   Now we can just continue to iterate.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.180]   That's usually how most projects sort of go.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.380]   - So I got a question I got to ask you.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.380]   So there's always a humorous to me transition
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.460]   between what a creative delivers
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.220]   versus what's in it being built by a web development.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.060]   - Yeah.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.420]   - So how do you, or any, is there a tool
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.500]   or a methodology you use or process to ensure
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.340]   that the highest likelihood of what you design
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.500]   is what is it being built?
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.780]   Is there any tips for designers to help you transition?
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.740]   - Yeah, the biggest tip I can say
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.100]   is always involve development early in the process.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.900]   Like your development team, it like,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.580]   well, I'll just say kudos to our development team
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.100]   because they have a design background.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.820]   So it makes life easier.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:14.140]   If you don't have that, development needs to happen.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.100]   Like they need to have a seat at the table at the UX phase.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.100]   They need to understand what's going on.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.100]   And also like how I sort of think of creative too
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.460]   is it's not just the creative team.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.620]   Developers are creative, strategy is creative,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.980]   data is creative.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.820]   So involve them at the beginning
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.380]   because they're going to have ideas
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.740]   on how a cool experience is
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.780]   from the development point of view.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.620]   So including them early in the process,
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.100]   having them in design review
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.580]   so that they can say, hey, Red Flag,
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.940]   I don't know if I can build that
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.020]   or now's a good time for me to start researching
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.980]   how to build it exactly how you want.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.140]   So that would be like tip number one.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.420]   Number two is Figma is a great tool
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.980]   for design and development collaboration.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.780]   It gives them code.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.340]   It allows us to prototype things.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.780]   A lot of sites right now like are not static.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.300]   They have motion and movement.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.700]   And as designers, we used to like say,
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.340]   hey, can you make this like squiggle or whatever?
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.780]   And the developer is like, I don't know what that means.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.340]   Now we can like really animate things quickly
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.740]   and be like, hey, is this something that you can do?
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.420]   And you're sort of collaborating
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.060]   in real time with the developer.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.700]   So that's how you kind of break that barrier
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.140]   from seeing a nice, beautiful comp
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.620]   to what we sort of call developer ready,
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.460]   which is like, hey, what is this?
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.900]   It doesn't look anything like it.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.740]   - Yeah.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.740]   - Helps like smooth all that over.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.460]   - Yeah, that's a really, really good point.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.220]   I think bringing development early on,
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.580]   I can think of a lot of the examples
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.140]   where that's actually really, really important.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.140]   So for example, like these days people want elegant design
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.340]   and sometimes elegant design is more flowy in nature
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.740]   and maybe there you build depth by having layers,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.340]   maybe the copy and elements sit differently.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.500]   But if you're a design developer
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.340]   and you think of the world
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.940]   in terms of horizontal blades,
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.780]   in terms of responsive design,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.340]   that little edge you wanted to fly out
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.820]   now breaks into another blade.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.020]   And now that actually physically can't be built that way.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.860]   And so you're right.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.300]   Like there's a lot of these creative elements
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.540]   where you just need to fair with development.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.260]   Like what can we build?
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.260]   And also be responsive.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.740]   I always gotta keep mobile in mind, right?
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.820]   You gotta bring them to the table and figure that out.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.500]   - Yeah, and that collaboration is key.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.620]   I think one project we worked on together,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.100]   'cause you were talking about blades,
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.380]   we designed where it,
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.140]   I think the design had like an angle
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.620]   and it was like, how do you make a nice seamless angle
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.820]   when you have sections on a page?
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.500]   So if I just delivered the design to the developer,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.580]   they would have been like, there's no way I can do this.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.020]   But when you have two heads sort of thinking,
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.460]   it's like, cool, in design, I can kind of fake it.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.860]   And this one sort of section,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.140]   like let's have the strip kind of align down here.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.340]   And then the other one, bring it up a little higher.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.780]   So it faked it in the way
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.860]   that the design still looked good.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.460]   And we were able to have like the different sections.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.420]   So that like design dev collaboration
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.020]   definitely needs to happen early on in the process.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:30.860]   - Cool.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.020]   I wanna transition a little bit,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.540]   just kind of hear a little bit about your journey.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.740]   Like, did you have a traditional like linear path
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.060]   to where you got here?
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.180]   Is it kind of like choose your own adventure?
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.580]   Kind of like mine was certainly like this,
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.740]   to where you got to where you are.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.580]   Are there any kind of like roadblocks you had to overcome
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.100]   and any kind of lessons you can share with the public here?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.420]   - Yeah, so I think mine was like all over the place.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.380]   So I started out, I actually started out in engineering,
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.660]   partially, like not even development,
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.260]   like building bridges, like engineering
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.100]   and totally not for me.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.860]   And then I moved into architecture,
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.140]   which is why I probably use a lot of architecture references.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.020]   That's sort of, and that relates to like a lot of UX
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.700]   and wireframes, but that's kind of how I started.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.100]   I worked at a lot of architecture firms.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.900]   So that's sort of my background.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.580]   And then I would say from there,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.220]   I just, I knew I wanted to do something creative.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.580]   I knew I wanted to be in design.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.980]   Back then there wasn't anything called like user experience.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.820]   It was just like web design and stuff like that.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.700]   But I think where I kind of moved around a lot
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.500]   was within different industries of design.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.500]   So I worked in fashion, product, tech, finance,
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.940]   like literally anything you can think of
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.740]   and just seeing how design worked there.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.940]   I'd say that probably the bigger lessons for me was like,
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:17.060]   I would say, I was always the type of sort of kid
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:23.460]   who was like, just put my head down and really work.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.580]   Like I would try to outwork everyone.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.420]   First one in, last one out, just really at work.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.180]   And I was like, cool, I'm introverted, I'm shy.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.020]   I don't wanna talk, I'm just gonna keep my head down
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.100]   and work.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   And I realized over time, that only gets you so far.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.660]   Stops being about, at times it stops being about
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.100]   what you know, but who you know to help guide you,
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:56.100]   to help open doors, to help even just elevate
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.380]   your own craft.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.740]   I'd say that's probably one of the biggest lessons
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.580]   I've learned.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.460]   And then also, I think too, just kind of like sharing
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:15.260]   in design world sometimes, like you get a design
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.180]   and you go do your own thing and you share it at the end.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.460]   And you're like, cool, this is what I did.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.540]   Sharing along the way and like involving people
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.540]   in your process, it really elevates and pushes your design
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.860]   and pushes you to think differently.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.700]   If you see someone else with the same thing,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.380]   you're like, cool, what am I gonna do next?
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.300]   But you have to share, you have to be open,
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.860]   you have to be collaborative to do that.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.740]   So I would say those are probably like the two biggest
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.260]   things I've learned along the way.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.860]   - Yeah, and I think even reading between the lines there,
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.900]   you have to be good with receiving constructive criticism
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.300]   too, right?
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.020]   'Cause like, again, like whether it's you kind of breaking
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.300]   through a mental block or kind of having someone work
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.740]   with you through that, or the design just doesn't meet
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.700]   someone else's standards.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.060]   Like you have to be able to take that feedback in
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.460]   to adjust, right?
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.940]   - Yeah, so, okay, I think receiving feedback when I first,
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.180]   so designers typically are very sensitive
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.620]   because they put their passion and their all into feedback
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.260]   or into their work.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.740]   I'm not really like that.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.700]   And I think school I went to.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.860]   So I went to School of Visual Arts in New York.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.060]   This school is like, in order to teach there,
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.780]   you have to be a working professional.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.780]   So you're getting critiqued by like people
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.140]   who potentially can be your boss.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.620]   Also a lot of great artists came out of this school.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.980]   Like, you know, a lot of famous people,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.740]   but the way that they critiqued was like,
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.060]   they were not shy, they were really blunt.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.860]   Some people like cry during critiques
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   and what it really established was for you to be able
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.140]   to give your all in your work,
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.540]   but then take a step back when you're being reviewed
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.100]   and actually see different perspectives
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.740]   and listen and understand without feeling
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.580]   an emotional attachment to it.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.980]   Through my experience, that's very hard for designers
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.540]   because they're so passionate.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.700]   But if you're able to sort of separate yourself
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.260]   and be like, okay, this is the work,
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.260]   it's not a reflection of me, you'll be very successful.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.980]   I'm still practicing that.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.740]   I'm sure every designer is still practicing that.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.820]   But what that also allows you to do too
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.660]   is become more collaborative.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.420]   It allows you to see things from a different light
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.140]   and a different perspective.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.140]   And a lot of times that's what creativity is too.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.660]   - Yeah, I remember when I was at LinkedIn,
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.060]   there was one saying that was always so cheesy,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.260]   but it's so true.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.420]   It's like, they literally say like feedback is a gift.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.340]   - It is.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.100]   - But it's also like a double-edged sword too, right?
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   But I think once you get in the habit
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.260]   of soliciting that feedback,
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.940]   that puts you a little more in the control
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.900]   of the feedback loop,
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.420]   as opposed to someone bombarding you from the side
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.780]   and critiquing your screen.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.100]   I think you're right.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.580]   There's an element of productivity
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.900]   where you can control that
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.020]   and then you can prep yourself for that.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.260]   But you're right.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.740]   People who are passionate about the work,
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.860]   musicians alike, right?
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.980]   It's also very, very subjective, by the way, right?
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.580]   And so somebody that's kind of,
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.620]   the way I do things is there's critique
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.780]   and then there's their opinion and then there's truth.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.380]   So how do I cut through all that critique
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.420]   to find the nugget of truth?
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.580]   And I'll hold onto that, right?
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.900]   And then let the other stuff,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.500]   don't bother me emotionally.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.780]   Sometimes I need to go out for a walk to decompress.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.460]   There's methods, but yeah, you're totally right.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.540]   I'm kind of curious for people who are looking
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.220]   to maybe explore transitioning
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.300]   into the creative field, right?
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.540]   Do you have examples of people
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.460]   who maybe come from non-traditional backgrounds
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.380]   and whether it's the mindset carries over or whatever?
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.180]   Can you give some examples of that?
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.220]   - Yeah, there's a few people who I've sort of mentored
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.780]   just when they were transitioning
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.580]   from a completely different industry into design
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.580]   and also their fears about, does this make sense?
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   So I think one girl I'm thinking of,
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.180]   she was a teacher, high school teacher,
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:42.940]   and she was just really interested in how to build websites,
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.540]   how to make websites in the creative point of view,
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.060]   totally, completely different
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.940]   than teaching high school students.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.940]   So she thought, but a lot of those skills are transferable
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.660]   when you're presenting,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.420]   when you're thinking about how to explain complex,
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.220]   I don't know, mathematic equations
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.660]   to high schoolers or to children.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.100]   It's a lot about understanding the audience and the user.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.300]   That's what user experience is,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.340]   knowing how to talk to people, knowing how to present.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.740]   All of the sort of foundational stuff, of course,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.740]   you gotta learn it, bootcamp, school, sure, that's teachable
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:31.180]   but the way that you understand, talk to users,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.460]   she was doing that already.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.100]   So it made, it was a tool that she could just use
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.140]   and leverage to kind of set her apart.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.500]   Teaching was one.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.460]   I also had someone who was into psychology.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.740]   I was like, come on,
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.340]   you don't think psychology can transfer?
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.420]   You're always trying to be in the mind
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.740]   and the psyche of a user.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.140]   I was like, shoot, just go ahead and do it.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.500]   I mean, a lot of skills kind of transfer.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   There was a football player who, hard work ethic,
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.860]   like a lot of things can transfer
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.660]   and really the teachable stuff, you can just learn online.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.900]   - Yeah, even to turn that on its head,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.460]   I agree with everything you say.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.220]   Like if we define a good designer
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.740]   as someone who has a good sense of who their audience is,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.180]   has an idea of what they're looking for
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:29.180]   and it creates a vehicle of which it pleases them to engage,
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.820]   that skill set can translate outside of design as well.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.700]   You know, like if you're going to go into product marketing
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.580]   where you're trying, or even customer marketing,
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.980]   where you're trying to figure out like,
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.540]   what is it that my customers truly care about
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.100]   and how do I deliver something that matters to them?
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.980]   Like these all actually matter.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.860]   As a matter of fact, you might even find niches
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.700]   within each of these marketing roles
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.660]   where having a sense of a creative eye
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.220]   as well as having that mindset
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.540]   might be the aspect that they're missing.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.580]   And so I think for people
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.780]   who are looking at transitioning careers,
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.740]   like if you feel like you've been in a career
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.100]   and creative your whole life and move out,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.300]   I don't want you to feel discouraged from doing that.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.140]   'Cause as a matter of fact,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.860]   you are a lot closer than you might realize,
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.700]   but to your point, Janelle,
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.660]   you got to put in some of the work,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.140]   whether you're within creative or externally,
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   but again, that's teachable, right?
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.180]   So I like how you framed that.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.500]   - Yeah, even in part of my career,
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.220]   I got really burnt out in design.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.500]   I didn't, it was like a lot going on.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.380]   I just didn't even feel like I wanted to be a designer
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.020]   and I switched to product management.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.580]   Like I was an engagement manager.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.300]   I don't know why I did that,
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.380]   but like I had a lot of fun,
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.060]   but even a lot of those skills were transferable
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   because when you're in a management position,
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.020]   especially at an agency,
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.660]   it's really valuable to be able to talk about
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.660]   all of the different, like not industries,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.060]   but all of the different aspects of the business.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.420]   So I was a project manager
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.940]   and I could talk about development
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.220]   without the dev team being there.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.860]   Not in detail, but you know,
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.500]   like I could talk about design.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.980]   I could talk about how everything sort of connects.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.820]   So it really does,
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.940]   like all these skills are really transferable.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.780]   Even now, like my role right now is leadership.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.460]   I can now look at the business in a different way
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.820]   and be like, cool,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.260]   there's a bunch of problems in the organization
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.940]   that we can be more efficient at.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.660]   Here are my user groups.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.460]   How do we get from point A to point C in a seamless way?
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.620]   Like you can take a lot of these tools
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.020]   and apply it literally anywhere.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.300]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.700]   Like skills absolutely build over time.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.620]   I remember early in my career,
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.340]   I didn't have the experience to lean on.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.220]   And so I got, and actually to age myself,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.180]   I graduated college during like a 2000.com bubble burst.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.820]   So like marketing was literally the last role
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.900]   people were hiring from.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.380]   And I took random jobs at like coffee shops
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.460]   or like I've also did like content entry.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.100]   I was even in a call center,
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.940]   like calling people at like eight in the morning
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.300]   on a Saturday saying that they overdrafted
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.500]   their bank account by like $2.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.180]   Now they owe 20, like you get a lot of angry people.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.980]   But I think that the key point is
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.620]   if every single experience or project you work on,
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.500]   you have to have a sense of true North
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.180]   in terms of what you want to gain out of that experience.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.220]   And as long as you're learning something
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.780]   that no job experience is ever beneath you
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.980]   or non applicable to you.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.180]   So I'm thinking like even as an early career,
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.020]   let's say you're a production artist
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.380]   and you're like, oh man, I'm just doing,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.100]   I'm just stamping out templates
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.460]   and they feel very transactional.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.820]   Well, you could think about,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.140]   hey, how can I do this more efficiently?
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.500]   Or is there a way to optimize a template?
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.420]   You just by doing that and change that mindset,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.700]   you are by the way, not only separating yourself
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.180]   from the rest of your peer group,
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.980]   but you're gaining skills to do that, right?
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.740]   And I think people will notice that.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.020]   And I think that kind of thing
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.620]   carries through your whole career.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.020]   - A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.260]   - So Janelle, I got a question for you.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.380]   So one piece of advice for a early career creative
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.660]   and one piece of advice for someone who's senior,
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.260]   who's looking at growing a career.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.980]   It's like, what advice would you give to them?
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.220]   - Okay, early career.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.500]   The advice I would probably give is,
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.700]   learn and absorb as much as you can from all aspects,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.260]   inside your field, outside your field,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.420]   just find where your interests are,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.420]   learn and absorb as much as you can
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.700]   and take notes and keep them somewhere.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.840]   For a senior person, I would say,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:50.980]   I think for me, I would say balance, learning balance,
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.300]   probably 'cause I struggled with that a lot,
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.860]   but learning to balance and prioritizing the things
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.540]   that are meaningful to you.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.380]   - I love that.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.020]   I agree with all that.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.860]   I'm like nodding my head.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.260]   I'm like, yeah, you're like talking to me.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.220]   How do you read my mind?
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.020]   Transitioning actually out of the world
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.860]   for design a little bit.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.740]   Like I think earlier I started off this conversation,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.620]   like totally like throwing compliments away,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.540]   but it's totally genuine where like,
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.660]   I really expect you as just a human being.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.500]   And there's an aspect of like bringing your true,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.340]   authentic self to work.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.700]   But even before you can do that,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.740]   you kind of have to discover that a little bit.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.380]   And so I'm kind of wondering like,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.700]   how did you discover your sense of self?
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.260]   Like what did that journey look like?
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.900]   And then at what point did you feel like that,
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   who you were like outside of work was the same person
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.740]   at work?
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.920]   - I feel like I'm still on that journey.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.760]   - Okay.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.620]   - I think for me, like I kind of mentioned this too.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.420]   I'm like super introverted and I'm super quiet.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.780]   So I think for me, whenever I go somewhere,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.860]   a new company, whatever it is, even outside,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.740]   like I'm meeting new people,
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:13.820]   I'm sort of just this sort of quiet person that observes.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.260]   And then once I start to feel comfortable,
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.820]   I'm like, cool, it's me.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.060]   Like, woo, like you'll get the full version.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.660]   But I think it takes time and a certain space
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.060]   and like your people in order to feel comfortable enough
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   to, you know, like not have to be your authentic self.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:41.600]   I think to work wise, like I dealt with like a lot
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.060]   of imposter syndrome.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.600]   So I couldn't even be able to feel like my authentic self.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.740]   So I did a lot of things.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.740]   Like I went back to school, I joined groups,
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.500]   I joined like clubs or whatever to talk these things out
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   with people who felt the same way.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.140]   And I was like, cool, I just can be open about this stuff.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.100]   'Cause everyone's feeling like this.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.980]   It's not just me, I'm not in this alone.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.380]   And as soon as I started to do that,
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.220]   everyone was like, yeah, I feel the same way.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   And it became such a safer environment that,
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.480]   yeah, like, cool, if you call me like, you know,
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.960]   on the weekend, I'm the same person
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.240]   as you see me on Monday,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.020]   except maybe I'm just more sleepy.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:28.000]   It takes time, it definitely takes time.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.040]   It definitely takes practice.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.920]   I'm still learning how to just even be more open
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.040]   and authentic and like, it's also just knowing yourself too.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.240]   And that's a different journey for everyone.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.940]   - Yeah, the imposter syndrome is a big one.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.560]   And I absolutely went through it.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.840]   I don't know if I share this story with you, Janelle.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.960]   Like when I was interviewing at LinkedIn,
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.640]   so I was being brought on
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.760]   to be their senior web marketing manager.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.880]   That was a title where like LinkedIn
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.560]   had just acquired lynda.com
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.760]   and they're trying to launch LinkedIn Learning.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.960]   And so there's all this stuff, right?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.520]   I remember during my interview,
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.160]   like all the way up to the VP who was interviewing me,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   like they asked questions that were like way in the weeds.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.800]   And I was like, oh my God, like, they know how,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.720]   like they could probably do my job
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.160]   and it's not their title.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.360]   And when I started working, it was the same way.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.480]   It's like, oh man, everyone is super smart.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.560]   And like, I bet you any of these people
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   who like I'm talking to you
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.960]   can probably just come and do my job.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.280]   And for that first year, I was like really miserable.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.840]   I self-inflicted wounds to myself a lot.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.080]   There were some areas
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.200]   that were legitimately areas of improvement though.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   Like earlier I mentioned,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.280]   find the truth nuggets within criticism.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.600]   Like my area was like analytics.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.480]   I love analytics now,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.960]   but back then it was like,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.840]   I was never the one pulling the data,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.880]   I was the one using the data.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.000]   So now I got to pull my own data.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.440]   It's like, oh my God, if I pull the wrong data,
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.160]   then I'm screwed, right?
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.000]   And I would present
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.800]   and people would like catch mistakes on the fly.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.440]   Like that didn't make sense.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.040]   Or this conclusion like didn't align with what's like,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.560]   like slide three slides ago on a site,
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.120]   small tiny print, like I don't know how to remember that.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.640]   And I really struggled that.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.920]   And to your point,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.680]   there was a part of it where I had to just embrace
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.320]   being okay with being vulnerable.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.680]   I had to just acknowledge that,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.200]   hey, like first off to your point,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.040]   I need to get some help.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.760]   I kind of got some peers to validate whatever.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.000]   Someone actually reminded me when this was really helpful.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.560]   They're like, people hired you
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.280]   because of what's between your ears
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.680]   and your hands as a creative, right?
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.080]   And it's unique to you
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.720]   and they hired you because you're good.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.560]   And they're so they're not the one
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.680]   who's telling you that you can't do it.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.520]   It's you, right?
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.720]   And so like, you kind of have to have
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.640]   that level of self-awareness,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.480]   kind of get over that.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.360]   But I think in the Bay Area,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.000]   like it's imposter syndrome,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.640]   especially here is like a huge deal.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.240]   - Yeah, I think I kind of mentioned this before.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.320]   Like I got burnt out
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.120]   and I switched to becoming an engagement manager.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.040]   I was also dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.760]   I was like, I can't do this.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.000]   We were getting,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.200]   I was working at a small startup
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.960]   and in the beginning we were getting like these,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.200]   you know, smaller clients.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.360]   It was cool, it was awesome.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.400]   But once we started getting like
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   these fortune 500 company clients,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.400]   the conversations I was like,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.880]   I don't know, this is like foreign language.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.240]   I do not know what anybody is talking about here.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.400]   I was anything, any question I asked,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.720]   I felt like I was just completely stupid.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.320]   And I was like, I don't,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.640]   creative is just not for me.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.680]   Like maybe let me just,
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.960]   especially it being so subjective.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.280]   I was like, I can't do this.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.040]   I'm gonna become a engagement manager where like,
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.960]   you know, I can just organize stuff and like learn.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.480]   And a lot of it had to do with one being burnt out,
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.720]   but also too, yeah, it was imposter syndrome.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.040]   I didn't, and it was only me giving myself this feedback.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:58.880]   - Yeah.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.800]   - We are really long.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.160]   I'm still not even over imposter syndrome,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.360]   but it took me a really long time to learn
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.920]   that it was myself and how to quiet that noise.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   'Cause like anytime you start something new,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.880]   like even if it's a new role or you get a promotion,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   like imposter syndrome is for real.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.720]   Like, you're like, man, can I do this?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.880]   But it's like, how do you just really quiet the noise?
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.600]   And like you said, they hired you for a reason.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.240]   They picked you for a reason.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.440]   You're here for a reason.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:33.080]   You're gonna have perspectives and experiences
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.480]   that literally no one else has had.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   And that's why, that alone is why you're here.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.440]   So just like really embrace that.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.080]   - I would never believe for a second
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.600]   that you're going through aspects of imposter syndrome now,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.720]   because you're so freaking amazing.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.480]   I think that's what's important for you to realize.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.520]   Like the people you're working with
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.320]   are all dealing with their stuff.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.160]   And I think when it comes to being like compassionate
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.840]   and empathetic with people,
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.120]   that's where I think that's where the real relationships
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.480]   are made and where you make a difference, right?
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.600]   'Cause like even speaking with you and kind of figuring like,
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.960]   hey, what are you working through?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.560]   Like, what are you challenged with?
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.240]   How can I walk alongside you to get over that?
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.040]   Or maybe it's just me being proactive
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.320]   and giving you verbal confirmation and encouragement.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   That may be all you need to kind of get over a mini hump
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.600]   that you're experiencing that day.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.000]   Like, is it kind of something
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   you experience every day as well?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.960]   - Oh my gosh, all the time.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.720]   I think it's more so, it used to be about the work
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   and like presenting it and feeling like I wasn't,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.680]   I just wasn't good enough to do it.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.960]   I think now it's changed into
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.320]   when I'm leading and coaching a team,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   it's like, are you guys sure you want my opinion on it?
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.520]   You know, or even like sometimes I might have to coach,
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.200]   like, you know, an executive person.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.720]   I'm like, me, you want my opinion?
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.200]   Like, are you sure?
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.160]   But it's like, you know, I kind of just always go back.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.920]   Like, we all have very super unique experiences
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.720]   and we just sort of have to,
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.040]   that's why we have a seat at the table
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.520]   or we're coming to make a seat at the table.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.040]   Yeah, I totally experience it every day.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.120]   But a lot of times I just have to be like,
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.560]   is this the truth?
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.920]   Is this how you're feeling?
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.840]   Is this an emotion?
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.680]   Yes, then just quiet that noise
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.200]   because it's, for me, I'm like, it's not gonna go away.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.320]   It's always gonna be there.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.120]   All my self-doubt is gonna be there.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.240]   I'm human, but like, I just have to quiet it
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.440]   and just speak from my,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.000]   we were talking about authentic self in my experiences.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.880]   - Yeah.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.760]   Well, Janelle, I just want to thank you for this time.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.080]   I really enjoyed this conversation.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.640]   I think there's a lot to be learned from what you said.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.920]   There's a lot of wisdom in your experience.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.480]   So just thank you for taking your time with us.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.280]   - Thank you for having me, Tim.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.600]   - All right, talk to you later.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.440]   - All right.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.280]   - Okay, bye.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.040]   (gentle music)
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
