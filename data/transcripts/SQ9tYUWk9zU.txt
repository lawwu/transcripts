[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   This was a post by you Sean, who is a former CEO of Reddit that
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.780]   was published back in I think 2015. He kind of lays out what I
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.760]   think happened. Reddit was sold for only about $10 million a
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400]   year after it launched. So like really, really small. And I
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.920]   think that it kept growing. And the founders realized maybe that
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040]   made a mistake. So they started scheming on how to get Conde Nast
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   to spin it back out. So you shun lays out the steps they went
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400]   through, they recruited a CEO, then they had that CEO demand
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   options specifically in Reddit from Conde Nast, which meant
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   that Conde Nast had to create a separate cap table for it. And
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.680]   then once they had a separate cap table, then they could sort
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.640]   of pressure to have like an outside investor bought in for
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600]   the expertise that just happened to be Sam Altman. Eventually
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.520]   step by step, they worked it to the point where they got Conde
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.280]   Nast to spin off the company. And I guess this plan worked. It
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.580]   should be said that the largest shareholder in Reddit, according
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.040]   to the S1 is Conde Nast's parent company. It was smart for Conde
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.240]   Nast to do the spin out and give up 70% to 30% of what's going to
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.440]   be a multi billion dollar IPO.
