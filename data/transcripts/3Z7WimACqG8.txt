[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.680]   founder of Legendary Entertainment,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.800]   known for producing blockbusters
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.120]   like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.240]   The Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   Jurassic World, 300, and many more.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.120]   He runs Talco, which is an investment company
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.000]   that focuses on how artificial intelligence
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.800]   can revolutionize large industries.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.480]   He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.000]   He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.600]   that tours with the Rolling Stones.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.320]   But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.340]   and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.440]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.880]   in the description.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.760]   And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.240]   In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000]   known for producing blockbusters
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.880]   like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight,
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.240]   and Dark Knight Rises, The Hangover franchise,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.880]   Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.200]   and the list goes on.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.400]   It's just some of the biggest movies in history.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.560]   What does it take to make an epic movie like that?
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.120]   Or what does it take to make it happen
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.200]   from start to finish?
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.600]   - Well, look, I've been enamored with movies
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   since I was a kid as a fan.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.200]   And I think what you need
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   is to be able to tell a great story.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.720]   And if you're gonna tell a great story,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.380]   you need a great director.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.640]   You gotta start with a fantastic script
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.360]   that is able to take some of these iconic characters
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.080]   that we did and put your own stamp on it
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   while still respecting the mythology.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720]   And I had zero experience in movies and television
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   before I started Legendary.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.220]   So it was a very interesting trip.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.300]   Total luck that we had the opportunity
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.020]   to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.140]   who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.500]   of all time.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.880]   But each one is its own little startup company.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.980]   And I don't think there's any formula to get there.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.140]   But I know that if you don't have a great director
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.620]   and a great script, if you don't have that foundation,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.940]   it's hard to pull off.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.180]   - Who's the CEO of that little startup company?
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.780]   Is it the director?
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.100]   Who would you say kind of defines the success
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.440]   or the failure of a movie?
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.000]   - Well, when you build a big movie like that,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.400]   it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.820]   I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.860]   I mean, if you have an amazing script, an amazing director,
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.980]   but you don't believe anybody playing the parts,
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.820]   that's a problem.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.940]   So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.820]   is I always used to say,
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.980]   you start with a stack of papers with words on it
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.820]   called the script, bring that to life.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.500]   And you're asking an audience to believe in everything
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.340]   that you're trying to put out there.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.060]   And you've got a cast that even if they're immensely
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.400]   talented individually, they have to mesh together,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.260]   they have to have chemistry together.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.780]   And the director is kind of the general on the battlefield,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.380]   but if you have a strong producer who's very hands-on,
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.340]   but it truly to me is each one had its own story
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.740]   and its own sort of how it came to be
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.340]   and why it worked or didn't work.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.780]   - So you said you were new to the industry,
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.540]   but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.620]   So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad,
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.340]   and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.460]   What are some interesting holes that you were able to,
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.340]   or like problems that you were able to fix?
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.840]   What problems still exist that can still be solved?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.980]   - Well, look, the business has changed
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.200]   so radically since 2004.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.740]   When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.580]   So, you know, that's how far things have come.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.140]   But I would say a couple of things.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.740]   The reason that I started it from a business perspective
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.220]   was at the time it was a $30 billion industry
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.660]   and there was no institutional capital
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   around the movie business.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.860]   And I was fascinated by that
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.140]   because almost every other category
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.980]   that you look at of that size
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.980]   has institutional capital, private equity, et cetera,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.020]   is kind of a cottage industry set up around it.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.020]   And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.780]   And the way the movie business worked
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.020]   was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.840]   So after kind of convincing myself
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.980]   that you could actually make money
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.540]   if you were disciplined and had the right approach,
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.140]   you know, went out, raised the money
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.740]   from the capital markets, which was Herculean,
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.900]   still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.000]   to walk around and say, look, I have no experience,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.980]   I've never done this before, but, you know.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.940]   And the second thing, being very fortunate at the time,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.740]   was able to partner up with Warner Brothers.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.860]   Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.920]   who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.660]   So really understood what I wanted to do.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.300]   And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.380]   someone that I still look up to to this day.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.860]   After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.460]   with their run, you know, between Marvel
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.660]   and Star Wars and everything.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.660]   And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.100]   the Dark Knight stuff, and then on to all the Disney stuff,
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.580]   he probably had as great a career
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.060]   as anyone I've ever heard of in the movie business.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.260]   So my first focus was around sort of two concepts,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260]   global, worldwide, large, tentpole films and franchises,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.760]   and then the business aspect of being,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.420]   bringing long-term institutional capital to bear.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.580]   - I'm gonna ask you dumb questions,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.500]   which is part of the style, I guess.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.820]   But just for people who don't know, including me,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.500]   what is institutional, what is capital?
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.340]   What is institutional capital?
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.700]   What is equity, what is private equity?
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.780]   - Got it, okay.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.080]   Well, so if you're starting a company
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.920]   and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.020]   and say, "Hey, you should invest in my company."
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.380]   Well, that's sort of, that's great and it's capital,
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.380]   but it's not getting money from Fidelity or T. Rowe
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.580]   or a sovereign wealth fund or an endowment fund
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.580]   from a university that has large pools of organized capital
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.500]   that has a long-term point of view on your business.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.260]   So if you get money from your neighbor
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.580]   who's a successful dentist, next year,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.540]   the dentist may say, "Hey, times are hard.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.380]   I need my money back."
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.660]   If your partner's with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.460]   or any of these institutions,
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.060]   they have the capital and the wherewithal to say,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.540]   "Okay, I'm looking in this over the next five to 10 years."
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.520]   And I thought there was an opportunity
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.860]   to bring that type of capital to the movie business
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.980]   to be patient.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.780]   - And the benefit of that patient, so it's long-term,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.980]   you have to deal with fewer parties
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.780]   and they would do much larger investments.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.100]   So what are the benefits?
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.540]   What are the sort of the challenges
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.740]   of that kind of investment?
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.220]   - Well, I think the benefits in some ways
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.780]   are they're professionals who are largely dispassionate.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.620]   Right, it's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.060]   you told me and you're hitting your plan, great.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.900]   And the other thing that always was interesting to me
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.480]   about the movie business is if I'm investing
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.300]   in an artificial intelligence company
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.540]   or a chip set company or something like that,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.900]   a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.380]   to really truly grasp what's being done.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.280]   So they don't, other than good business practices,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.700]   they're not offering every little opinion.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.160]   The movies and television are completely approachable,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.860]   meaning everybody has an opinion.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.420]   So whether it's, I think you guys chose the wrong actor
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.380]   for that, or why did you do that movie?
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.380]   It's, so it invites a lot more sort of second guessing
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.500]   and things like that.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.780]   So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.420]   of the business that I thought was interesting.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.220]   And then when you talk about private equity
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.820]   versus public equity, if you're a public company
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.140]   where the companies can, are traded,
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.500]   you want to buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your broker
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.800]   go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.780]   If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity,
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.120]   that's institutions or individuals investing
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.140]   in private companies.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.680]   So thus the, if you have pools of capital
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.540]   that mostly invest in private equity deals,
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.540]   that's how you think about it.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.180]   - It's difficult to make those happen
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.540]   'cause it's individuals, you have to sort of,
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.460]   what have dinners and agree.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.160]   So it's much less, it's much more human,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.580]   much less mechanical, I would say.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.020]   - Yeah, now, and again, massive difference
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.020]   between large private equity shops who are professionalized
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.400]   and in the same category that I mentioned earlier
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.300]   versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.980]   But again, it's much more individualized
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.740]   when you're going to people who like your idea
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.140]   and just say, I'd like to invest in this.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.200]   - Is there, is that from all the kinds of investments
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   you've seen, what do you think is the most conducive
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.680]   to creating works of genius,
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.100]   whether that's in technology, AI space,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.400]   or whether that's in movies?
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.240]   - Sure.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.100]   - So creating something special in this world.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.800]   - I would say a couple of things.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.500]   that you're not so nervous about the edges, right?
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.160]   If I have $100 to spend and I think I can create
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.020]   a perpetual motion machine or something for $104,
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.600]   I can't do it because they're all over me about the budget.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.180]   So I would say making sure that you have enough capital,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.340]   making sure that that capital is patient enough
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.320]   so that it's, if you're going to do things
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.000]   that are extraordinary, it takes some time
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.120]   and you're going to break stuff, right?
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.200]   You're going to make mistakes.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.840]   You're going to have a whole bunch of film
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.520]   on the cutting room floor, so to speak.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.420]   Or if you're in the lab, you're going to have a whole bunch
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.160]   of broken stuff.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.680]   And I also think it's very important at the beginning,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.440]   and I always try to do this with companies I invest in
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   or buy, is make sure that you have a philosophical
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.120]   and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.280]   So that going in, you both understand, hey,
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.840]   this is how we think about this problem or this company.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.560]   This is what we feel like our culture is.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.760]   This is what our goal is.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.960]   And these are the metrics by which we'll agree
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.680]   to measure them by.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.040]   Because if you don't have that shared, you know,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.720]   hey, we're going to take this journey,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.320]   then I think that's where people get upset,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.100]   disappointed, et cetera.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.540]   - What about, this is a weird question,
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.240]   but constraints, so this is both for filmmaking
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.060]   and investment, do you think more money is always better?
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.520]   - No.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.880]   - So I like constraints a lot.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.400]   It's like constraints and almost like a desperation
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.520]   and deadlines are a catalyst for creativity,
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.240]   for productivity, for sort of innovation.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.880]   So can you kind of speak to that?
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.720]   - Sure.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.400]   - As an investor, as a creator,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.440]   like what's the right balance here?
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.640]   - Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.000]   or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   and you feel like I have unlimited resources
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.240]   or renewable resources, so there's really,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.540]   there's no leverage in the situation, right?
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   There's no, if I fail at this, I'll just go get more money.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.900]   Right, I'll just go, I think that's a hard way
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   to be resilient and to think of new ways to solve problems.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:05.700]   So I think capitalizing things just to the nth degree
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.620]   does create some problems.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.380]   So I think there's that perfect blend
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.980]   of don't starve the oxygen to the point
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.940]   where you make short-term decisions
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.720]   or non-strategic or thoughtful decisions
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.380]   because you got to pay the rent.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.180]   And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.940]   everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want,
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.420]   we'll just keep flowing the cash
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.080]   because that doesn't create any friction points
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   that I think do result in works of genius
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.220]   in things that are transformative.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.460]   And one of the things that is interesting to me
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.600]   about society sort of writ large is,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.100]   I think that when you go through hard times
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.260]   and you have to do things that are uncomfortable
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.980]   and you don't want to do them 'cause you're tired,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.420]   'cause you're, that in some ways builds up
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.700]   that you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.860]   and you can't sort of paint with a wide brush,
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.860]   but that's one of the things that I kind of observe
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.300]   and hope that we don't go that way.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.220]   - I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.920]   It's like overcoming that.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.020]   It's like from every perspective,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.180]   from a human perspective,
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.360]   it's a source of happiness and fulfillment,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.780]   overcoming challenge.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.840]   But from a business perspective,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.860]   I see like if something is really difficult,
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.740]   to me it's also a sign that most others would,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.400]   or many others would fail at this point.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.940]   So like it's a feature.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.140]   It's nice that something is difficult.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.100]   When people tell you that something is impossible,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.980]   I love that 'cause it's like, all right,
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.940]   well then that's what a lot of people would believe.
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.500]   And that gives you an opportunity to be the person
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.100]   who shows it's not impossible.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.760]   And of course you might be wrong,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.080]   but if you're not wrong,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.560]   you have the opportunity to stand out.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.160]   So going through that hardship,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.360]   taking those big risks is going to really pay off.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.080]   of both personal life, it's just good for life,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.760]   but for business, it seems like just good business sense.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.640]   If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.460]   - Yeah.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.500]   Most others will fail.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.400]   Fun question.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.520]   I don't know if you can answer this,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.160]   but what's the most expensive movie
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.820]   you were involved with to make and why was it?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.860]   You don't have to say numbers,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.140]   but like, do something stand out
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.400]   as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive?
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.320]   - I think "Jurassic World" was pretty expensive.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.220]   I mean, worked out great.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.920]   And-
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.620]   - That's an epic film, by the way.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.900]   - Look, it's one of my favorites.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.160]   They just did an amazing job.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.400]   And frankly, the crazy thing about my life
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.060]   is all the stuff that I loved as a kid
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.240]   somehow came full circle back into my adult life.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.300]   And having the opportunity while I was out there
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.200]   to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.120]   and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.760]   I mean, that was pretty surreal.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.140]   So that was an expensive film.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.820]   "Dark Knight Rises" was an expensive film.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.640]   But again, to me, there's a difference
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.480]   between expensive and irresponsible.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.520]   And expensive because the vision warranted
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.180]   and it turned out financially, it certainly did.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.680]   - Yeah, with "Jurassic World,"
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.420]   I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.980]   'cause you have to create so much.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.100]   And so much of it is obviously not real.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.220]   You can't bring dinosaurs in.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.780]   - Yeah.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.460]   - Is that where a lot of the cost is,
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.460]   is in the computer side of things?
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.140]   - Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.660]   of the budget.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.180]   And especially if you're doing it
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.740]   and inventing things as you go.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.540]   I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:41.540]   who is designing the plane as it's flying
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.940]   in such a brilliant way.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.540]   And I've got to know him over the years
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.380]   and just in awe of the way his brain works.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.300]   And so, yeah, it's a big component.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.020]   - Can you speak a little bit more to him
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.060]   in terms of, 'cause you're such a fascinating person
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.940]   'cause you care a lot about technology.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.020]   You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.300]   So how does he, a creator, a director,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.460]   build the plane while it's flying?
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.620]   Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process?
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.040]   - Well, so I never made a film with Jim.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.660]   I'm just a huge fan and got to know him
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.340]   and John Landau, his producing partner.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.620]   And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.580]   is, so he makes Titanic
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.960]   and there's a bunch of underwater cameras
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.520]   and things that they need that don't exist.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.780]   So he goes and invents them
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.940]   and has a good grasp of engineering
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.060]   and has not only the imagination
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.820]   but the ability to lead a team to build them.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.020]   I got to go down early when they were shooting "Avatar"
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.940]   at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.020]   And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.700]   and that they could go back later
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.540]   because they created the environment, it blew my mind.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.180]   And I said, okay, this is truly,
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.040]   people talk about a big leap, this certainly is one.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.700]   So he has continued to push the envelope
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.900]   in terms of the art of the possible.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.740]   And I just think he's an incredible genius in that way.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   - Again, another hard question.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.000]   So you in the realm of music care about story, storytelling.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.300]   Is there some aspect in which money
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.040]   and beautiful graphics get in the way of story?
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:47.140]   In filmmaking, so if you think about "Jurassic World",
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.900]   obviously that's an experience like any other.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.780]   Like, what do you think about the tension
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.780]   between story, experience and like visual effects?
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.380]   - Well, look, if you're using big effect shots
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.540]   and all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.660]   that you don't have a very interesting story to tell,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.760]   that's where I think it gets in the way.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.820]   Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers,
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.520]   we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.260]   Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on,
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:34.020]   folks that just see the world differently
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.820]   and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right?
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.780]   To make you believe differently,
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.820]   rather to make you not just suspend your disbelief,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.420]   but to feel like you're immersed in it.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.280]   So I've certainly seen it done expertly
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.620]   and I've seen it done poorly.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.460]   - You've talked about this a little bit in the past.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.140]   You kind of left the moviemaking business
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.660]   at an interesting time, perhaps you saw the changes.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.100]   There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.860]   so the role of film in society has changed.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.180]   So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.460]   Like if you were as a business person, as a creator,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.800]   as a consumer, as a technologist,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.520]   are thinking about the next 10, 20 years,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.960]   what do you think is going to be the godfather,
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.060]   the great pieces that move us as a society
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.320]   in the next 10, 20 years?
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   Is it going to be TV?
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.660]   Is it going to be movie?
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.680]   Is it going to be a TikTok clips?
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.600]   What is it?
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.560]   - Well, so, and I think the other category
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.000]   that I would add to that,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.280]   that will be the next great medium
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.000]   is truly immersive virtual reality
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   in which new storytellers will emerge,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.960]   especially when you can go into VR
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.260]   and there's enough computing power to sustain it
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.320]   and to allow it to be social
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.680]   and for you to have different paths to go down.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.040]   That'll be, I think, the next realm
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   of what storytelling and experience will look like.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.120]   - So do you think a video game kind of world
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.160]   or is it more movies or is it more social network
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.000]   or is it all of it kind of blending reality
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.780]   and gaming and movies?
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.080]   - Yeah, I thought if you saw "Ready Player One,"
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.820]   which I love the book and the movie was cool too,
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.960]   but that's one version of it, right?
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.640]   Where you go in,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.600]   now everybody's talking about the metaverse and all that,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.680]   but you go into a world that's fully rendered
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.520]   as yourself and you interact with that world.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.080]   The other side of it is to go in
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.760]   somewhere between being a passive observer
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.080]   but being able to move around your point of view
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.320]   and experiences, which I think is interesting.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.120]   And then I think another adventure, so to speak,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.320]   I could think of is a blend of video games.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.040]   So there's a mission, right?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.600]   There's obstacles, there's everything,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.900]   and you move through it, but it's immersive
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.640]   and it tells a story at the same time.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.760]   And that's why I think you're gonna see
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   new, amazing storytellers that we don't know yet
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   that understand how to innovate
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.900]   and how to make you feel something in that environment.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.720]   And to your earlier point,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   I saw probably around 2015
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.800]   when Netflix decided to be bold,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.560]   put out "House of Cards," put out all the episodes,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.320]   leave you in charge of the pace
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.620]   at which you would view them, which I thought was great.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.800]   - That was a gutsy move.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.760]   - Yes, it was.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.640]   And I can't tell you around Hollywood,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.280]   anybody that says that everybody thought
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.560]   it was a great idea is not being truthful
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.360]   because everybody I talked to said this is,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.160]   they're idiots, right?
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.520]   What do they know about movie making and TV?
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   And what I saw happening was
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.160]   if you look at what Netflix pulled off
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.720]   and they realized that there isn't really a moat
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   around the studios, you really could make stuff
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.560]   and really good stuff.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.920]   And so they started to create their own content
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.680]   that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.560]   through YouTube, and then you had Hulu,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.240]   then you had Disney deciding
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.680]   that they're gonna have Disney Plus.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   And the next thing you know,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.880]   you have some of the biggest companies
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.120]   with the largest balance sheets on the planet
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.020]   being in the creative business.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.480]   If you're an independent,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.580]   that's bringing a knife to a gunfight to be sure.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.760]   And so I thought that was interesting.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.640]   The other thing that it used to be
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.360]   that movies were where the big things happened
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.320]   and television was sort of,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.160]   it was small screen, different experience.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.760]   And you had something like "Game of Thrones" come out,
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.840]   which was not only on the same epic level visually
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.120]   and storytelling wise,
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.040]   but had the budget to be able to do it.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.560]   And now I think you're seeing
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:35.760]   all kinds of different storytelling taking place.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.280]   And also like that you're not pigeonholed into a time.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.620]   Like you got two hours to tell the story.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.480]   You can do a three-part miniseries, a five-part miniseries.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.680]   You can do television that's,
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   all kinds of different format.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.560]   That I think is,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.180]   allows creators to do a lot more interesting things.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.680]   - It is also interesting to consider the role of companies
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.640]   that enable that, like the capital that enables that.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.200]   Without Netflix, you wouldn't,
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   an HBO, you wouldn't have some of these epic shows.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.360]   And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.660]   that you're talking about,
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.120]   it's interesting to consider who will enable that.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.520]   You know, now, like you said,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.320]   Facebook is talking about meta and metaverse,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.720]   but it's unclear that just having money is enough.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.440]   Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.160]   There's a, you know, Amazon has money.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.360]   There's a lot of companies that have money
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.480]   that don't quite do as good of a job yet
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.640]   at enabling creators of,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.520]   creating revolutionary new content
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.640]   that changes the whole industry.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.120]   And that's probably going to be the case
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.400]   with virtual reality.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.400]   like in terms of compute infrastructure.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.520]   There needs to be a huge amount of money there,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.920]   to have fun, to do their best work.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   And at the same time,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.600]   like provide the perfect amount of constraints,
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.480]   all of that together.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.180]   Like however Netflix makes it happen,
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.460]   they do a pretty good job
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.880]   'cause it's a very constrained platform,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.340]   but yet all the creators I've ever talked to,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.320]   comedians and so on, that work with Netflix
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.880]   are really happy 'cause they feel free to create their work.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.280]   - Yeah, and I think a lot of times,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.560]   you know, companies are a letterhead,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.480]   but it boils down to the people.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.720]   And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.840]   who ran the studio at Netflix
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.420]   and now took over for Reed running the company.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.640]   But Ted, very smart, talented guy,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.880]   and understood early how to cultivate talent
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.520]   and relationships with talent, which is important.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.240]   When you're dealing with creative people,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.280]   their motivations and their goals
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.000]   are not always the same, right?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.420]   They're not always capitalistic, right?
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.900]   And so in terms of being able to communicate
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.640]   with creative people that are not always A to B to C
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.960]   is a talent.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.200]   And so I think they did a great job.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.300]   Ted did a great job with that early.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.440]   You know, but I think that you're gonna see
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.480]   different formats.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.200]   I don't think, I mean, going to a theater
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.600]   to see a massive movie on that screen in that format
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.260]   is a fundamentally different experience.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.900]   And I think you're gonna find movies,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.800]   you know, my old shop Legendary just put out "Dune,"
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.400]   which I thought was phenomenal.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.640]   When we secured the rights to "Dune" years ago,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.420]   I was over the moon because I love the book.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.420]   I love the entire world that is "Dune."
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.920]   And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.320]   I think when "Avatar 2" comes out,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.020]   I wanna see that on a big screen.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.600]   But I think you're gonna see a ton of content
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.420]   is obviously being produced,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.120]   and it's not all gonna go to a theater going experience.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.200]   So you're gonna see, I think, different versions of this
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.760]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.120]   - In case James Cameron is listening to this,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.280]   so he officially agreed to talk at the time of,
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.840]   on this podcast at the time of "Avatar 2" release.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.800]   I'm just holding you to that in this recorded conversation.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.540]   Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.260]   There's something special about movies.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.800]   You know, they win Oscars.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.760]   They're historic in nature.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.480]   There's something about TV shows,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.000]   even when they're epic like "Game of Thrones,"
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.360]   that they're forgotten much quicker in history.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.680]   I don't know, maybe that's
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   because we haven't had enough of them,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.200]   but you know, the De Niro performances,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.800]   and you know, the Scorsese films,
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.200]   all the great films that kind of we think of
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.320]   throughout the generations,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.280]   that define generations are films.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.000]   Is that just old school thinking?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.120]   Is that always going to be the case?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.000]   - I mean, look, to me,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.360]   going in a darkened theater with a bunch of strangers
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.980]   and the lights go down, and you go on this journey,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.000]   there is something special and magical about that.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.480]   And I think movies have been a part
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.080]   of our cultural fabric forever.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.440]   And for some reason, Hollywood in America
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.320]   was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it, right?
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.080]   And not that there aren't great foreign movies,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.080]   but far and away, American movies dominate
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.440]   not only the world market,
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.280]   but you know, and so whatever it is that we do well,
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.760]   or Hollywood does well,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.560]   you know, there's something in the water apparently.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.840]   But I agree that I love movies,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.560]   and I will, you know, for the rest of my days.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.760]   It's interesting how creators can move back
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.600]   and forth now as well.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.300]   That used to be a complete no-no.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.280]   You're either a movie guy, or you're a person,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.600]   or you're a TV director, and that's that.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.640]   But those lines have completely blurred.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.480]   - And they're also blurring,
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.120]   I mean, they're blurring all kinds of lines.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.200]   Like they're moving to TikTok and Instagram.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.600]   And like, I know right now it seems ridiculous
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.720]   to consider that these like one minute things
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.320]   could be considered even in the same realm creatively
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.560]   as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.240]   Maybe experiences can completely become fluid
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.720]   in terms of their size,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.200]   as long as they have some deep lasting impact
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.160]   on you as a human being, as a consumer.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.360]   - Look, to me, the whole thing is about
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.080]   either the moving image, or even sometimes a picture
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.440]   will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.120]   So, you know, short form is harder
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.560]   because you have less time to set things up and all that.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.840]   But I'm sure there will be short videos
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.600]   and creators that come up with things.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.560]   And if a moving image can get a reaction out of you
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.160]   and make you feel a certain way
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.800]   and stay with you or inspire you,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.440]   well, that to me is just the next evolution
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.400]   of whatever it's going to be
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.080]   between humans and cameras, et cetera.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.720]   - See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.000]   That's why I love robots,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.480]   is I think there's certain things in the short form
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.360]   with robots that immediately can bring out
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.000]   a feeling in people.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.520]   There's something about our consideration
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.160]   of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.440]   of all the fears and hopes
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.160]   and the beautiful things about human nature,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.800]   the dark things about human nature
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   that somehow, especially Lego robots bring out.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.400]   'Cause we have both a fear and excitement towards that.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   Are these going to be our overlords,
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.760]   our gods that overtake humanity?
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.400]   Are these going to be things like horses
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.160]   or something like that, something that empower humanity?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.960]   Like you don't know what to make sense of it.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.880]   That's why they're super exciting.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.720]   - I agree.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.320]   - Speaking of robots and film,
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.560]   you've gone into traditional industries
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.440]   and disrupted them quite a few times.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.040]   Was there, is there a system for deciding
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.800]   which industry is right for disruption?
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.000]   When you look at the world and see
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.440]   what are the big problems you would like to solve?
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.560]   Do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.960]   How do you look at the world?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.380]   - Yeah, well, on the business side of that,
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.600]   so I have a holding company called Tolko,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.400]   I know, very imaginatively named.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.520]   Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken,
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.200]   registered and all that stuff.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.800]   So we're a holding company.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.020]   - What's a holding company?
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.960]   - So instead of being a fund that has money
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.280]   flowing in and out of it,
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.920]   and there's what's called a vintage year,
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.620]   I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.720]   for so long and then I give it back to you,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.680]   which sometimes creates artificial time pressures
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.520]   and things like that.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.160]   A holding company is more permanent capital.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   So the idea was behind Tolko was to buy,
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.840]   almost always whole companies or majority stakes
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.680]   with great management teams in spaces
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.080]   that did not traditionally have a lot of innovation.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.720]   And to have our labs group who were data scientists,
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.360]   and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.400]   So to provide them with the right capital
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.320]   and to provide them with access to technology
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.880]   that would be hard to individually recruit
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.840]   for that company.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   So I would say that the thesis was to look for industries
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   that were large enough,
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.240]   that hadn't traditionally had access
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.480]   to that type of technology or innovation,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   and to try to look for companies
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.620]   that not only look that part,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.160]   but had management teams that embrace this
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.000]   and wanted to take that kind of journey.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.720]   - Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that,
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   but that finding the industries and the management pair,
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.040]   because those industries often have
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.380]   a lot of old school folks who don't.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.120]   It takes quite a bit of work for them
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.880]   to leap into technology.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.600]   I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.040]   and just the automotive industry.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.840]   Depending on the company, there's old school folks.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.360]   It's like Detroit thinking versus,
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.200]   what would you call it?
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.360]   I don't know, California thinking.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.800]   - Well, I think you have to look at the nexus
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.640]   of two things there.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   One is just plain old human behavior.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   If I am uncomfortable and this isn't a comfort zone for me,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.200]   and it's not something I have as a field of expertise,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.280]   I'm gonna shy away from that.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.720]   Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   and it's a big successful company or person
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.920]   or whatever it might be.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.160]   And the second thing is that,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.840]   especially if you're a public company
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.480]   and you're being weighed and measured every quarter,
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.440]   you are rewarding the managers of that company
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.360]   to hit metrics and to be reliable and to say,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.240]   hey, I'm counting quarter to quarter
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.720]   that you're gonna deliver what you say.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.360]   It's difficult to say, you know what, everybody?
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.640]   For the next two years, I wouldn't count
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.360]   on our financial projections at all
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.720]   'cause we're gonna reinvent what we're doing.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.240]   It's gonna work in the long run
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.680]   and you're gonna see that this was a really smart investment
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.120]   five to seven years from now.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:23.560]   That's not the way capitalism is currently wired generally.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.520]   So again, if you reward managers with yearly bonuses
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.680]   and stock options based and tied to stock price
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.100]   and all these other things,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   and then ask them to go break stuff,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.160]   that's hard, I think.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.040]   - So you're saying like,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.920]   the talk of approach to this,
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.120]   the private investment is the best way
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.760]   or perhaps the only way to enable
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   this kind of long-term innovation,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.640]   investment, taking big risks, investing in innovation.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.280]   - Well, look, we certainly are not by any means
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.360]   the only one doing it.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.160]   I'm just saying that when you think about big companies,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.880]   the more successful that are in old line businesses,
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.400]   and I hear people sort of talk about,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.160]   well, why can't they just pivot?
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   They recognize they need to be in the technology business
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.640]   well, 'cause it's hard.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.160]   It's hard to steer a ship and turn it that big.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.720]   And especially if it's not part of your DNA at that company.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:33.680]   So, I just think that what we tried to do
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.480]   is to enable management teams
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.800]   that know where they want to go
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.240]   and to be patient with capital,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.080]   and also again, bring innovation
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.680]   to bear that they have access to.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.640]   But there's plenty of capital structures
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.360]   doing interesting things.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.400]   That's one of the things I love about our country.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.720]   This country innovates and this country invents things.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   And I'm constantly in awe of just the human ability
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:13.420]   to innovate and to iterate.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.040]   I get to hang around some universities,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.560]   including your old shop, MIT, and it's like--
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.280]   - I'm still there. - Yeah, you're still there.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   - Still teaching there. - Still teaching.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.160]   But that place is like Hogwarts.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.680]   I mean, it's just, it's inspiring, right?
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.040]   And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.400]   which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.720]   has its own incredible ecosystem.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.040]   So, that's one of the things I love about America
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.800]   is the ability, and that really is,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.200]   I think, in the American DNA,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.680]   to create things and invent things.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.920]   And I just, I think that's invigorating.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.220]   - And I think that's even bigger than capitalism,
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.460]   sort of the machine of how capitalism works.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.920]   That's just human nature.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.560]   Capitalism is just one of the ways
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   to sort of make that human nature shine, I suppose.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.820]   But it's like, you mentioned MIT.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:20.260]   There's a drive there to invent, to innovate.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   That's so purely human, that human spirit
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.120]   to sort of build something new.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.180]   It's like that hopeful, optimistic spirit,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.020]   especially in the engineering space.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.580]   Like, if you pay attention to the internet,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.180]   like Twitter and all that kind of stuff,
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.460]   intellectuals and so on, there's a cynicism
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.300]   to when we talk about stuff,
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.900]   but there's an optimism to when we do stuff.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.860]   And the doing part, when you actually build things,
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.900]   especially, like you care a lot about manufacturing too.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.840]   Like, you actually build physical products,
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.140]   that's where we truly shine.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.020]   - Yeah, no question about it.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.020]   And I'm passionate about our country making stuff again,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.540]   doing our own manufacturing
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.020]   and making sure that we don't lose the ability,
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.940]   not just to create things intellectually
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.520]   and do the world's greatest blueprints,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.060]   but actually make things here.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.100]   - Actual factories.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.260]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.120]   - How do we do that?
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.640]   How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.600]   - Well, there's a company that I have
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.960]   a big personal investment in called Rebuild
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.680]   with some folks that all went through the MIT school
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.080]   years ago.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.120]   There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.680]   who used to be at Amazon.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.660]   And we all felt the same way that,
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.820]   America needed to make sure
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.540]   that it didn't lose its edge in that way.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.240]   So it's a company that invests
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.920]   in American high-tech manufacturing.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.500]   And I think the way that we do that is provide capital,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.620]   provide training.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.300]   To me, this is also fertile ground for good,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.320]   sustainable, high-paying jobs.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:21.340]   And we have to make it economically feasible to do that
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.180]   again here in this country.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.500]   And not to say to companies that again,
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.820]   are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter,
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.460]   hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here,
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.140]   but you should do it here.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.980]   We need to innovate and we need to create processes
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.980]   and companies and opportunity that balance that equation.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.460]   And I think as we saw during the pandemic,
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.180]   I don't think in this day and age
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.620]   you can be an isolationist.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.500]   That doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.900]   But being self-reliant and self-determinant
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.060]   and making sure that you are never in a position
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.880]   as a nation that we can't do basic things
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.320]   because we're relying on supply chain in other countries.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.360]   And whether it's, we're not friends anymore
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.920]   or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.180]   I think those are costs of doing business
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.020]   that we have to put into the calculus
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.860]   of being able to make things here.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.460]   - There's an extremely high cost
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.140]   to making supply chain resilient
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.860]   that we really have to consider.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.460]   And so if you really consider that cost,
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.100]   it makes a lot of sense to invest,
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.520]   especially long-term in building up manufacturing
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.960]   in a way where like you're making most of the stuff
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.380]   in one place.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.940]   Sort of bringing it all, not all,
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.020]   but as much in as possible
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.840]   and building it almost like from scratch,
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840]   here in the United States.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   I mean, what, I guess your thought is with innovation,
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.660]   it's possible to sort of revolutionize
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.900]   the way we do manufacturing.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.580]   So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.260]   and like build stuff from scratch,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.780]   like do high-tech manufacturing.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.740]   So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.660]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:18.660]   - Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.800]   is the human machine interface, right?
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.520]   It's not, let's automate everything
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.040]   and have nobody work anywhere.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   I, for a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable,
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.660]   but where we can enhance jobs
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:41.400]   and make that interface immensely productive
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.920]   with the right training and so forth,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.280]   I think that's a worthwhile endeavor
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.220]   and something that's gonna be important to our country.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.940]   - Yeah, I mean, you're, you know who you're talking to.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.900]   I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.300]   human AI interaction.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.140]   So what do you think is the role of robotics
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.300]   in this high-tech manufacturing?
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.420]   Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.420]   all that kind of stuff,
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   or even more complicated kind of robots.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.700]   What do you think is the role of robotics?
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.260]   What do you think is the role of AI
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   in this manufacturing future you're thinking about?
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.400]   - Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.100]   I don't have the same expertise that you do.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.020]   I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.200]   Have never really delved deeply into it
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.420]   or made investments in it.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.540]   But I think what's exciting about it
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.020]   is everything from doing jobs
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.440]   that are very dangerous for humans,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.580]   enhancing the human experience.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.940]   When you look at really repetitive labor,
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.100]   things that, you know, it might take away a job,
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.580]   but is it a good job for that person?
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.340]   Is, you know, spending 30 years
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.180]   doing something highly repetitious,
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.020]   is that a good experience in life?
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.540]   So I think, and then when you think about everything
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.980]   from military applications, you know, rescue,
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.020]   we're already seeing a bunch of those things.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.660]   And then just lastly,
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.180]   when you talk about that human interaction with robots,
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.980]   when you start to have the combination,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.260]   so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.760]   I mean, that's why we always love the droids
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.820]   and Star Wars, right?
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.220]   I mean, it's exciting.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.880]   It captures the imagination.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.700]   And I think, look, many, many hours
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.740]   have been spent on debating artificial intelligence
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:47.140]   and the ramifications if things go sideways and so forth.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.580]   And I think those are all, you know,
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.180]   those are appropriate conversations to be having.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.220]   AI is happening.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.960]   I think it's actually happening slower
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.420]   than most people realize
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.580]   because there are tasks that humans do
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.740]   every minute of every day standing up
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.620]   without losing your sense of balance.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.860]   I mean, these are really hard things,
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.660]   but I think there's enough investment
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.820]   both in private industry as well as nation states now
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.640]   on artificial intelligence that it is coming.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.340]   - So both in the software space, in the digital space
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.100]   and in the physical space.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.620]   So we talked about manufacturing,
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.820]   so industrial robotics is very true
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.060]   that even in the factory,
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.060]   even the tasks that you think are pretty basic,
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.300]   you know, the amount of small intuitive decisions
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.540]   that humans make is quite incredible.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.760]   So we have to be kind of explicit about saying
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.140]   which tasks are actually really hard
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.660]   and humans are just really good at them.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.220]   And so on the flip side, in the digital space
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.620]   with social networks, with recommender systems,
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.740]   with all kinds of like personal assistance
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:09.740]   in terms of voice-based AI systems, all of that,
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.140]   there's opportunities there to find niches
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.260]   where AI can really have a transformative effect.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:22.180]   I think one of the places that really haven't,
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:27.420]   this is where like you're worried to say stupid things,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.400]   but I believe this very much,
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.140]   that when we have AI systems in the home currently,
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.500]   you have somebody like Alexa and Google Home and so on,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.820]   they're kind of very basic servants.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.940]   They tell you about the weather,
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.220]   they can play some music,
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.060]   they can turn the lights on and off,
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.620]   all that kind of like smart home stuff.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.380]   I think there's a lot of value in systems
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.080]   that form relationships with us
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.980]   in the way that pets do, dogs and cats.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.320]   I don't know, just for people who have cats,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.500]   cats don't care about you.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.520]   They really don't.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.120]   They don't form any kind of relationship.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.040]   I don't know why you have relationship with them.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.280]   It's one way.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.940]   Anyway, sorry, I threw on some shade.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.200]   I'm just kidding, by the way.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.960]   That's a basic kind of connection you have
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.960]   with another living being.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.440]   Then there's also just friends.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.680]   You have different levels of friends, acquaintances,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.560]   you have lifelong friends, all that.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.280]   That friendship you have,
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.880]   I really believe that there is some aspect
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.600]   of the human experience that is deeply enriched
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.400]   by interacting with other beings.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.320]   And for systems, computing systems,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.060]   artificial intelligence systems in our world,
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.940]   to have the capability to engage in some of that,
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.000]   I think is not just an opportunity
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.600]   to help people grow, become better people,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.120]   but it's also just a good business opportunity too.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.560]   And that hasn't really been explored enough.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.760]   So that to me is really,
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.560]   that's a whole exciting space that I think
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   will enable better industrial robotics.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.480]   It will empower a better Facebook
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.120]   or a better social network,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.760]   a competitor to Facebook that overthrows Facebook.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.680]   So it'll create better technologies
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.320]   that currently don't have
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   that human robot interaction touch.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.400]   So I don't know.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.720]   That's super exciting to me,
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.960]   The reason that most robotics people
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.280]   and AI people stay away from humans,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.880]   they stay away from the human robot interaction problem
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.320]   is 'cause humans are complicated.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.460]   They're messy.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.180]   They're hard to control.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.180]   They're hard to predict stuff about.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.660]   They're hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.860]   because one human can be drastically different
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.940]   from another human.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.120]   And so to deal with that as a robotics problem is super hard.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.600]   And so one of the questions is,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.060]   which problems can you remove the human from consideration
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.580]   when you're trying to solve the problem?
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.700]   So like Elon Musk is an example of somebody
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.540]   who believes autonomous driving,
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.140]   we can remove the human from consideration.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.420]   We can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.360]   It's stay in the lane.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.540]   When there's a red light, you stop at a red light.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.560]   If there is humans in the picture like pedestrians,
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.520]   that's a ballistics problem.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.540]   It's just treat them as a moving object
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.620]   that has a, with like 90% probability
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.860]   keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.780]   with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.460]   Like just do some basic models about them
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.260]   and you'll be able to do just fine.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.140]   So I tend to believe that even driving
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:01.060]   has to consider the full messiness of humans.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.900]   The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:08.740]   that we all do when we jaywalk, we look at the car,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.100]   is that car, that car doesn't,
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.100]   that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.580]   So I'm going to walk in front of it and not look at the car.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.020]   We do that kind of dance and AI systems need to be able
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:22.080]   to play, do that kind of dance.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:28.460]   In Talco, there's the labs.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.260]   So there's a data science component, it's an AI component.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.780]   So how do they go into a company
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.100]   and help revolutionize that industry?
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.820]   - Well, there's different examples.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:44.820]   So one of our companies, FIGS, makes healthcare workwear,
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.580]   started by these two brilliant women.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   And early days, helping to build the platform
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:58.620]   and recruit and make sure that everything that we did
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:03.360]   at the company embraced technology.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.060]   And at the same time, they were obsessive
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.940]   about their customer, which is doctors, nurses,
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.620]   healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.100]   and obsessive about their product.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.340]   And when you have those two things come together,
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.340]   you get the result that we did at FIGS.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.780]   We have a company called Acasure,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:31.540]   which it's AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.700]   It was an insurance,
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.720]   one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   And we did a deal with them and sold some
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.460]   of our insurance holdings.
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.580]   It was completely AI driven.
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:50.820]   And in that case, you basically put the team
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.820]   inside the company, right?
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.260]   Because it's a massive company with all,
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.260]   and we've gone into all kinds of things.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:03.940]   So it just depends on the different situations.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.720]   But the biggest thing was just to make sure
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   whatever the company needed, they had access to the talent.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.300]   Sometimes we'd build it,
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.520]   sometimes we'd help recruit for it.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.520]   You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.260]   There's no one way to do things.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.780]   - Well, Acasure is really interesting as an example.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.620]   So insurance is a fascinating space.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.380]   It seems like very ripe still
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.660]   for disruption across the board.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.600]   So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   has to do with like almost the first dumb step
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:47.060]   of we've been using mostly paper, like it's not digitized.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.880]   You have to basically convert,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.200]   create a infrastructure and a framework
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.360]   where like everybody is using the same digital system,
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.040]   like databases and just organize the data.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.340]   It seems like that's a huge leap
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.000]   that basically can revolutionize major industries
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.480]   that still hasn't been done.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.040]   Insurance is obviously the great example of that.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.800]   - And one of the things that struck me,
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.080]   the founder CEO of Acasure is a guy named Greg Williams.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.180]   They're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.520]   And as we were looking at expanding our footprint
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.300]   in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.360]   and they would talk about technology,
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.880]   but Greg truly understood the power
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.100]   of what would happen across actuarial sciences,
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.280]   predictive analytics and using machine learning
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.560]   to really run every aspect of your business
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.440]   and then automating a lot of the,
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.560]   just the back office, tedious steps.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.720]   And as you said, one of the things that was great for us,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   they already had a data collection system and department.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.040]   So it was much easier to pivot.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:01.140]   And I'm very excited about the future of that company.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:07.440]   They're doing some pretty innovative groundbreaking things.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.040]   And those are the things that I like doing, right?
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.400]   Is that, yes, I wanna make money,
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.320]   just, you know, that's what that is.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.000]   But at the same time,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.600]   what did you do with your time on earth, right?
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.360]   Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.680]   that, you know, you did anything interesting?
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.500]   I can only speak for myself.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:33.400]   There are many more ways to measure one's life
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.660]   and I can only speak about how I think about things.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.420]   You know, I grew up poor in upstate New York
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.260]   with a single mom and watched her work a couple jobs
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.700]   and, you know, had to, from a young age,
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.660]   you know, shovel snow and mow lawns
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.780]   and do all kinds of things to help her
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.340]   make sure the lights weren't turned off
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.260]   in our little place.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.300]   And so that's just something
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.200]   that I've always been driven towards.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.380]   And, you know, I just,
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:07.100]   I have really eclectic tastes and interests
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.260]   and, you know, it's just been an interesting journey.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.740]   So help be part of and help enable
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:19.740]   some cool new creations across the board,
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:24.820]   like film, music, AI, manufacturing,
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.340]   just, you know, insurance,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.820]   all the specific industries that you disrupted.
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.380]   - Yeah, small tangent,
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:39.220]   back to your childhood with your mom,
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.660]   any memories kind of stand out,
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:47.260]   stick with you as something that helped define
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.140]   who you are as a man?
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.620]   - Yeah, even though, you know,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.280]   the university and college experience
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.860]   was not part of the family tree
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.220]   and we had no connections,
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.220]   I didn't understand, I didn't know what a trust fund was
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.720]   or prep school, I didn't know what any of that was.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.960]   But my mom from a young age would always say,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.180]   you know, you're gonna go to college,
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.340]   there's no, you know, if you choose to,
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.980]   and I think from a young age,
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.060]   that was just an expectation that I had
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.260]   and that she instilled and the work ethic,
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.340]   I watched her and then my grandmother
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:31.340]   was a janitor, a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:36.420]   And then I remember there were times of, you know,
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.500]   I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing cold out
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.860]   and if I don't go out and shovel six driveways,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.060]   we don't have enough money to pay the bill.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.420]   So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist,
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.860]   so I don't know how that manifests itself in my life today,
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   but I think the grit to say,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.620]   I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't wanna do this,
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.460]   but that's the work that needs to be done.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.460]   And no excuses, not I'm a victim
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.260]   and I'm gonna sit around and talk about,
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.380]   no, it is what it is and you have to get done
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.020]   what you need to get done.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.180]   And again, I think it's,
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:22.420]   you can never fully put yourself in someone else's shoes
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.780]   or experience, 'cause I don't know what that is
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.180]   or feels like, but for me, those were two,
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:33.180]   I think formative things that were important in my childhood.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.020]   - So that's pretty, the reality of life like that
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.380]   is pretty humbling.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.820]   You still, you've been so exceptionally successful
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.140]   that it's easy to get soft now.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.380]   How do you get humble these days?
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.580]   - By getting up.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.380]   You know, I think for me personally,
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   trying to push the envelope
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.300]   and being weighed and measured, right?
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.740]   That's why I always love sports too.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.580]   There's a scoreboard and I'm a huge believer
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:09.020]   in opportunity, meritocracy, all those things
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:14.020]   that I think are ideals that we wanna aspire to.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:18.300]   And I think that there's a lot of things
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.420]   I'm involved with right now that I just wanna see
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.260]   if I can do it.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:27.260]   I wanna see if, and my own little mantra
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.660]   is cause the outcome, right?
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.500]   As much as you can, and at the same time,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.100]   have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.940]   to say, I'm always gonna cause the outcome
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.740]   'cause you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.100]   and humbled.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.180]   The world and the universe is a big place
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.700]   with forces beyond.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:53.580]   But I think, I also think a lot
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.220]   about being intellectually honest,
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.540]   which when I do university talks and so forth,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.700]   I think that's a superpower.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.620]   Because if you find yourself making decisions
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.100]   based on other people's expectations,
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.300]   based on places you don't wanna go,
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.700]   but you're either, you feel like momentum
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.940]   is taking you there.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.180]   I think that's a big problem.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.980]   And there are people that go to our top universities
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.620]   and can't wait to get out and start their own company.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.180]   And they want that pressure and they want to grind.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.540]   And there are other people that are smart and talented,
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:41.100]   but just say, look, I don't wanna lay awake
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.060]   staring at the ceiling,
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.700]   wondering how I'm gonna make payroll.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.500]   I don't want that in my life.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.620]   And I think if you can square that up
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.260]   and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick?
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.820]   What makes me happy?
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.700]   What puts me in a bad head space?
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.940]   'Cause there's a difference between challenging yourself
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:00.100]   and going against your nature.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.020]   So that's why I think that being intellectually honest
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.300]   and being able to really sit down
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.820]   and go inside your own head and say, what am I good at?
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.500]   What am I not good at?
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.780]   How am I gonna put myself in a position to be successful?
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.460]   Because I'm working on my weaknesses,
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.860]   but I'm not gonna put myself career-wise in a position
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.840]   where I'm just fundamentally gonna have a hard time
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.820]   being successful.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:30.100]   - Yeah, intellectually honest is a tricky one.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.300]   And it gets, there's like levels to it too.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.140]   - Sure.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.840]   - Well, some of the things, I think about when you,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.460]   when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things,
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:53.540]   part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.320]   One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.940]   like one, the fact that nobody's done it
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.940]   probably shows that you're just a dreamer.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.100]   This is not going to, like think clearly.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.180]   The fact that it hasn't been done probably shows
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.480]   that it may not be the right path.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.700]   And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff,
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.700]   there's a certain point where it's like,
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.820]   hey, you haven't done it.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.740]   Like, why haven't you done it already then?
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.220]   Like, you have to be honest with yourself.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.460]   Like, you have to be ambitious.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.460]   Like, you know, a lot of people work hard a long time
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.620]   for a dream, but you have to wake up and be like,
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.980]   all right, I've been at this for 10 years.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.220]   Like with a startup, you launch a startup
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.800]   and you think, okay, one year, two years,
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.060]   three years, four years, pretty successful, you know,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:49.980]   but it hasn't exploded.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.540]   Like you dreamed and you have to shut it down.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.980]   You know, you have to be intellectually honest there.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.100]   At the same time, you might want to be
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.060]   like step it up, lean into it.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:09.180]   Say almost like the flip side of like intellectual honesty
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:14.980]   is like maddening ambition of just saying, fuck it,
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.940]   I'm going to go all in.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.820]   But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like,
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.140]   you know, the big problem here is I've been kind of going,
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.400]   doing too many things.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.940]   Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.780]   All those kinds of things.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.180]   I mean, this is human experience, it's complicated.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.580]   - Yes, all human things are complicated.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:41.660]   And I think there's a difference between being reckless
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.960]   and making well thought out informed decisions.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.340]   If you're going to go all in, make sure you've, you know,
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.860]   measure twice, cut once, as they say.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.780]   And one of my other favorite, I forget, many years ago,
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.420]   I heard this saying and it stayed with me.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:02.420]   It was never mistake clear line of sight with distance.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:07.460]   And you know that, so I think that the key,
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.020]   whether you're starting a business
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.300]   or you're thinking about leaving the company you're at
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.300]   and starting a business or just leaving for another job,
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.180]   any of these things is as much as you can, right?
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.300]   And psychologists, I think, would tell us
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   it's hard to be self-aware completely, right?
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.540]   That's the rub, that if we were all completely self-aware
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.340]   of everything that we did and strength and weaknesses,
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   it'd be a different world.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:35.480]   But I do think you can work on that
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.380]   and at least challenge yourself to think about it
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:42.740]   and not be in a position where I'm, you know,
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:43.940]   I'm going to medical school
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.620]   'cause that's what you do in my family.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.400]   And even though I'm miserable doing it,
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.660]   you know, things like that.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.700]   - So definitely you don't want to be sort of,
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.700]   because you don't think fall victim to conformity.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.180]   Let's just go on doing the same thing over and over.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.020]   - That's right.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:08.020]   - But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:16.540]   It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:21.340]   are where you cut once and measure later.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.220]   - Is you leap in first.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.060]   - Sure.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.020]   - It's almost like a gut.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.340]   I suppose that is a measurement,
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.300]   but you build up a good gut instinct of like what to do.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.820]   And then you just do it.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:37.100]   And then you figure out as it's the building the airplane
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:37.940]   as you're flying it.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.020]   - Right.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.900]   Well, and I think each one of those instances
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.060]   that you could probably cite
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.740]   has its own unique circumstances, right?
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.360]   I don't have a deep biotech background.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.900]   So if I suddenly stood up and said,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.060]   I'm going to put everything I have into this idea.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.620]   Well, that's, you know, those are, right.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.840]   It's game theory, right?
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.860]   What are the odds of success?
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:04.900]   If on the other hand, you know,
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.820]   you're brilliant in your field,
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.780]   or you've seen some opportunity
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.060]   that you think is wide open
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.100]   and you're going to go for it and break stuff.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.140]   That's great.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.100]   You just want to weigh, to me, always say like,
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.700]   how crazy is this on the spectrum of, you know,
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.820]   do I have any expertise?
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:30.020]   What is the downside if I fail, right?
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.300]   You know, if you're at a certain point in life
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.780]   with young children and you've got a mortgage
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.100]   and whatever else, that is one circumstance
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.280]   versus I just got out of Stanford
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.740]   or I just got out of whatever and I'm going to go for it.
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.020]   It's just the whole thing, right?
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.900]   It is complex as you point out.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.780]   And sometimes you just want to have the right matrix
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.460]   in your head of decision-making process
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.660]   to try to arrive at the right place.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.300]   And even if you get close,
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.640]   that's where I think you say, you know what?
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.620]   The hell with it.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.580]   I'm doing this.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.860]   - Yeah.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.580]   I do want to ask you about one specific idea
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.620]   that sounds super fascinating
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.860]   that you're involved with recently.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.220]   You led the $15 million seed round
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.340]   for a company called Colossal
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.320]   that is focused on de-extinction.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.500]   This is funny relative to our connection
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.500]   and conversation about Jurassic world.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.900]   They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:34.660]   and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.260]   to the Arctic tundra.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.640]   How are they going to do that?
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.360]   - Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.320]   named George Church five, six years ago.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.800]   And found him to be incredibly smart,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.620]   have an imagination.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.820]   And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb,
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.100]   who's an entrepreneur.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:07.160]   And basically the press and to me,
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.000]   the imaginative, like you're capturing my imagination
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.240]   by telling me you're going to bring back
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.620]   the woolly mammoth and other extinct animals.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.720]   And we'll see where that road leads.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.240]   I was more interested in an investor
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.480]   in the things that they're working through
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:30.080]   around understanding genes and proteins
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.840]   and CRISPR and all these other things.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.840]   Because being adjacent to George Church and his team
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.040]   as these things unfold over the next decade,
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.840]   I thought was the right thing to do.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.180]   - So people are important here.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.200]   Just like investing in people
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.120]   and seeing what the hell they come up with.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:48.960]   - Absolutely.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.420]   I mean, you can look through history
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   and great things are done by great people.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:02.360]   And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.820]   and immediately what you think of them.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.360]   But they started out with a person, with an idea
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.320]   and a team that cultivated that and made that happen.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.560]   And I think there are certain folks
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.240]   that are just immensely talented
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.840]   that if you can be around them,
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.940]   and I also know his and his team's ethics
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.680]   in terms of after spending time
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.380]   talking about where the lines are.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:37.480]   People in other countries that may not have the same process,
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.760]   may not have the same checks and balances
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.500]   are doing this and pursuing this regardless.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.280]   So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.280]   they're also very responsible people.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.560]   - This is where the human side of things comes into play.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.960]   I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.000]   in the technology space where you kind of,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.520]   there's a lot of ways to feel this out.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.880]   You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.000]   You can feel out how much they really understand
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.240]   about like human nature here.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.780]   Like whatever the technology is,
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.820]   when it actually starts to play,
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.140]   interact with society at scale,
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.620]   like do they have an understanding
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.400]   or an intuition about how that happens?
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.180]   Some of that requires studying history.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.460]   Some of that requires like just looking at the worst
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.340]   and best parts and events in human history
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.800]   to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.860]   like everybody hoped the technology turns out.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:47.380]   If a person has a depth of understanding about history,
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   about human nature, then I think that's the right person
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.540]   to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.820]   - Yeah, you want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.420]   (laughing)
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.280]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.460]   Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.380]   with Warren Buffett, you spoke really highly of him
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.520]   as an investor, as a human being.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.180]   What about him do you admire?
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.140]   What from him, what insights have you drawn from him
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.700]   as a great investor yourself?
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.220]   - Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him,
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.900]   which is something I'll treasure forever.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.260]   Look, sometimes when you meet people,
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.340]   even that are immensely successful,
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.340]   you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour,
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.300]   oh, you were in the right place at the right time
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.740]   and that's fine.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.940]   There are other people that are clearly different, special,
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.940]   and I don't care if you made them start from zero,
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:56.940]   would end up in a good place.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.580]   And so it was an absolute privilege
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.980]   to spend the time with him.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.060]   - You know, a couple of things that stood out
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.340]   in the conversation,
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:12.860]   he is incredibly intellectually curious and well-read.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.800]   And I like how simplistic he likes
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.960]   to keep his thought matrix.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.080]   And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market,
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.680]   it seems like a simple axiom, but just look,
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.100]   good companies that are led by talented managers
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.100]   that are good businesses over time are gonna get there.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.820]   So I'm not gonna day trade, I'm just gonna,
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.380]   I'm looking for value.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.860]   And then just on life stuff, he just,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   and also his ability to take in and then use information
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:54.660]   was incredibly impressive.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.260]   So I only spent the, I'd met him before,
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.180]   but I only spent one afternoon with him,
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.700]   but it's pretty incredible.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.140]   And one of the things that stuck out to me
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.860]   is we were in the middle of talking about
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.800]   Tolko or investing or how we thought about it.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.540]   And I said, "I'm trying to be smart about."
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.060]   And he stopped me and he said,
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.980]   "Charlie Munger, his partner of many years,
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.940]   "Charlie and I don't try to think of the smart thing to do.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:24.660]   "We try to think what's the dumb thing we could do here."
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.880]   And I kind of laughed and he said,
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.980]   "No, I'm dead serious.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.820]   "We think about it from the standpoint of
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.640]   "what could we do in this situation that later we'd be like,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.500]   "that was a really dumb thing to do."
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.800]   And I actually thought that was,
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.460]   it got in my head and I still think a lot about that
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.680]   as I'm dissecting problems.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.540]   - So there is, like, that's a kind of long-term thinking
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.100]   if you just avoid the dumb things,
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps,
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.700]   all it takes is just do that for a long period of time
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.500]   and you'll be successful.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.740]   - Well, it certainly worked for him.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.580]   That's all I can say.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.220]   - What about you?
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:14.660]   You've been a great investor yourself.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.220]   How do you know, when you judge people,
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.140]   so whenever I go to San Francisco,
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.940]   I was thinking of moving to San Francisco.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.140]   That's why I decided to,
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.420]   after really giving it some thought,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.660]   talking to people, decided to move to Austin.
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.660]   Everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.820]   And it's actually, I don't envy the job of an investor
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:42.180]   of any kind because everybody has big dreams
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.140]   and it's hard to know who exactly,
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.380]   what idea is going to materialize,
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.700]   what team is going to materialize into something great.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:55.140]   How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:16:01.900]   - Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this,
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:04.860]   it absolutely starts with the people.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.780]   And I think the reason for that is,
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.340]   your business plan is going to change, right?
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:13.340]   There's very few businesses I know of that say,
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.020]   we're going to make a widget in this location
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.460]   and 30 years later, we're successful
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:21.060]   and we just make a widget and that's what it is.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.420]   Things happen, right?
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.980]   And today they happen with such velocity
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:30.980]   that you have to be able to make hard decisions
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.220]   based on imperfect information.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:38.700]   And how are you going to calculate those answers?
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.780]   How self-interested are you going to be?
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.940]   What kind of ethics will you apply?
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.500]   What's your short-term versus long-term thinking?
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.980]   Are you able to give an honest assessment
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.180]   of a situation?
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.860]   Because the thing that you can count on
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.660]   is problems are going to happen.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:01.660]   Things you didn't anticipate are going to happen.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.060]   How pliable are you, right?
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:09.060]   How much elasticity is there in your ability
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.660]   to be successful?
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:15.300]   And I think it's important when you invest in something
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.020]   that you both see,
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:21.740]   you understand the roadmap ahead and agree to it, right?
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.460]   It doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns,
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.060]   but you're not like, well, wait a minute,
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.260]   what did we do here?
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.540]   This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.940]   And then I think honesty and communication
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.700]   is a huge thing to me with,
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:42.340]   I always tell people if bi-directionally,
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.780]   if there's something going on,
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.820]   start the conversation with Lex,
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.380]   we have a problem.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.180]   Okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention,
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.180]   we're going to talk about whatever it is.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.860]   Bad news should travel faster than good news.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:01.300]   And because it's going to happen,
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.460]   being in business with someone
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:06.180]   that is going to shoot you straight
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.860]   and sometimes say, I don't know.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:10.940]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.500]   I got to go figure it out.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.900]   That I can process a lot better than,
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.420]   look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.940]   or I can't handle not having success.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.020]   So we're just going to kick the can.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.940]   And I think, especially in today's business environment,
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.820]   that's very, very dangerous.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.220]   - So that's a bad sign,
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.660]   not just because it's good to do,
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.740]   to communicate and be honest,
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.780]   but if they're not willing to do that,
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.260]   then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.780]   They're probably not also able to be
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.340]   brutally honest with themselves
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.380]   when they look in the mirror
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.420]   about the direction of the company.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.260]   - But look, I wasn't there, so I don't know.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.780]   But I think if you unpack many situations
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.020]   that turned out negatively,
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.380]   most of the people,
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.700]   whether you're faking lab results, right?
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.820]   You have a biotech company.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.420]   We have everybody staring at Theranos these days.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.660]   Do I think in a lot of cases,
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.180]   you're either the villain,
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.860]   like you started out saying,
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.100]   I'm going to screw my shareholders over
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.460]   and I'm going to be a liar.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.740]   That isn't my experience.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:25.940]   Most things are little incremental moves that you say,
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.500]   we're going to get this right next week,
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.180]   but today we got to make the presentation.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.700]   So we're going to just tweak things a little bit.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.140]   That's a slippery slope, right?
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:38.620]   And so that's why I think from a standpoint of people,
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.820]   you want to go into the foxhole
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:46.820]   with folks that understand things are going to happen
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:49.020]   and I'm going to let you know about them
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.980]   and we're going to try to solve them together.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.380]   And then just in terms of the idea,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.780]   it's, I always ask like, okay,
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.380]   if this company executed the way,
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.860]   that's the other thing that always cracks me up
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.180]   about financials.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.060]   Whenever somebody pitches you,
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.180]   inevitably they'll say,
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.940]   our projections are really, really conservative.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.580]   I'm still waiting for somebody to come in
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.460]   and say, look, my projections are wildly optimistic.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.180]   We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:23.820]   If this company did what it says and executes,
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.460]   does it matter?
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.220]   Right, does it move the needle enough?
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:31.380]   And what are the things that uniquely position
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.220]   this company to be successful?
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.060]   And you just have to be able to answer,
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.100]   I think a number of those questions pretty crisply.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.660]   But at the end of the day, it's still a big risk.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.500]   So you just try to minimize the risk.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:49.220]   Let me jump to another topic.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:53.020]   You're an incredible human being
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.380]   that you're involved with this.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.660]   Your band, Ghost Hounds,
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:00.380]   is touring with the Rolling Stones.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.940]   So before we talk about your band,
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.500]   let me ask about that.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.140]   What's that like, playing with the Rolling Stones?
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:12.140]   Surreal, just because they're my favorite band of all time.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.260]   To me, the greatest rock and roll band.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:19.020]   It's not even close of all time.
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:24.020]   And to share the same stage, to be on tour
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.660]   and to go out and get that energy from the crowd.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:32.340]   And every night, and come off stage,
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.700]   and later when they go on and you hear that iconic,
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.660]   ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.540]   And then it's incredible.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:42.420]   And what's amazing to me about the band,
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.180]   next year will be their 60th anniversary, 60 years.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:53.020]   And it's hard to be around anything for that long,
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.540]   but making music and packing stadiums.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.700]   And what's amazing to me, they can play a two-hour set.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.460]   And it's not just that, oh, that's a hit
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.060]   or you recognize it.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.060]   It's like every song is an anthem, right?
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:07.740]   - Yeah.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.780]   - So it's been amazing.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.740]   We got to play with them in 2019.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.620]   And when they ask us to do this again,
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.820]   it's just an absolute privilege.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.580]   - I asked you this offline,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.260]   so I know you are a kind of rock star.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.100]   - Yeah.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.580]   - But just me, maybe I'm projecting,
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:30.300]   but do you get nervous?
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.700]   Such a large audience with the Rolling Stones?
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.980]   It feels like there'll be a lot of pressure.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.460]   - Yeah, I mean, you definitely don't want to screw it up.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:44.460]   I think the band, our band, is tight knit and all that stuff.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:50.620]   And I think that you, the individual nervousness dissipates
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.340]   when you go out as a group and you're making music together
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:57.180]   and you sort of, okay, we're all in this
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.620]   and we're doing a thing, which is why even in sports,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.700]   I always look at individual events like ice skating
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.020]   or anything where it's just you out there alone.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:12.180]   And that's different than being with a team
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.020]   and nerve wracking.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.820]   So I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.900]   just going out, it would feel different.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.700]   But absolutely you get the right kind of butterflies,
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.540]   I would call it.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.020]   And just the energy of playing music
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.260]   and having it be this relationship
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:35.540]   and look, I get it, I've been to a ton of concerts
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.620]   where I'm like, look, can we just get to the band, please?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:42.380]   But what's been great is just an amazing reception.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.460]   And we have this guy named Trey Nation
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.900]   as the lead singer is just incredibly talented.
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:54.180]   I mean, he's just not only an amazing voice
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.460]   but just has that charismatic thing.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.900]   - Yeah, he's great.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.740]   - It's fun.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:02.780]   - What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.060]   As a guitarist, what's the feel?
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.340]   Are you lost in the music?
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:10.580]   Like you almost don't feel the audience.
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:12.300]   Does it add extra energy?
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.300]   Does it add extra anxiety?
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.620]   What does it make?
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:16.740]   What's it feel like?
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:19.420]   - Stadiums are interesting
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.340]   just because it's so big and cavernous
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.580]   and because you wanna protect your ears.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.220]   So we use an in-ear system
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.580]   so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.180]   because if you're playing that loud
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.380]   and you're standing in front of your amps
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.180]   without ear protection, that's bad.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.180]   - How are you monitoring the sound?
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.540]   The in-ear stuff, is that producing sound
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.940]   or is it strictly earplugs?
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.140]   - No, it's producing the sound.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.500]   So it's like putting ear pods in and listening to a song
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.820]   and you're playing to it, right?
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.460]   It's just us playing, but it protects your ears.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.020]   But the energy from the crowd
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.620]   when they get going and get into it,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.340]   which knock on wood so far has been amazing,
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.820]   there's nothing like it.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:12.220]   It's just this bi-directional thing that happens.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:18.780]   Music and sports were kind of my first loves.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:26.660]   Yeah, it's very difficult to describe, I think accurately
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.980]   because it's like no other feeling.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:35.500]   - Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.860]   with the band by yourself practicing?
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.500]   Do you feel like you're creating something different
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:47.500]   when you got the guitar and the amp
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.180]   and just the sound dissipating out
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.820]   and everybody's listening?
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:55.660]   - Listen, the first time we did it
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.100]   and there's nobody in the stadium,
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.220]   first time I ever played in a stadium
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:03.300]   and I'm just like, I'm out there in front
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.300]   and just hitting different chords
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.420]   and playing different licks.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.220]   And I'm like, it's like I won a contest
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:10.460]   and I get to do this.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.020]   But what's different about it,
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.300]   and each venue is different.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:21.300]   So if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago,
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.380]   which was incredible, love Billy Gibbons, he's a Texan,
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:28.100]   incredible person and guitar player.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:32.540]   But when you're playing in like five to 7,000 seats,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.420]   it's really, I mean, you're right there with them,
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.340]   with the crowd.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.780]   And then when you play in an arena,
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:44.260]   we toured with Bob Seger on his last tour,
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.060]   which was cool, played some shows with him.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:50.180]   And again, the arena, like they're all kind of packed
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:54.180]   on top of you and it's super loud, which was cool.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.580]   Meaning the crowd is,
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.900]   stadiums is a completely different animal.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.900]   And it's just a completely different experience.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.340]   - Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:13.340]   What's as a guitarist, as a musician,
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.740]   what's your favorite like room to play?
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.580]   Of the size?
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.820]   - Any room that'll have me.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:23.660]   Look, I think arenas are the perfect blend,
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:28.420]   if I had to say, because it's loud and 20, 30,000 people,
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.100]   but like right up on you.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:36.100]   Stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling Stones,
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:40.060]   it just is gonna go on the head marker somewhere,
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.020]   is one of the more,
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.660]   I say this and I really mean it.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.140]   My life is like a punked episode that just hasn't,
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:51.540]   no one's burst in yet, but yeah,
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.260]   it's as cool as you think it is.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.300]   - So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.540]   How do you explain it?
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.460]   - I gotta tell you something.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.260]   I mean, the funny thing is,
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.380]   whatever, wherever there is excellence,
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:09.660]   people wanna know how'd you do it, right?
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:10.860]   What's the secret?
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.660]   Not only is Mick Jagger,
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.500]   and I think the songs that Keith Richards
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.020]   and Mick Jagger wrote together,
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.020]   if you go back and listen to the lyrics,
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.980]   it's just incredibly poignant
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:27.380]   and I'm just a huge Stones fan,
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:32.380]   but he works out like a maniac, right?
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:35.580]   And it's that 10,000 hours thing,
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.620]   and it's that, hey, maybe I don't feel my best today,
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.100]   but I'm gonna get up and do my routine
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.540]   and work out so that at his age,
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:49.180]   which I mean, you can look at people at different ages
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.740]   chronologically that are,
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.380]   maybe we're both at this age,
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:57.860]   but I'm a lot older than you are and vice versa.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.100]   and the ability, and he's very smart, right?
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.500]   Like he understands how to have interaction with a crowd
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.020]   and hold them in the palm of his hand
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.860]   and be an entertainer.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.140]   But then on top of that,
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:19.100]   the reason he can at this age run around stadiums
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.740]   and be just as energetic as he puts the work in.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.740]   And that's one thing,
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.620]   step that I think a lot of people miss sometimes
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.060]   where they want that magic trick,
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.340]   they wanna know what's the shortcut.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:32.820]   Most of the time the answer is there's no shortcut.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.180]   - Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.080]   and work hard to stay on top.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.020]   - That's it.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.820]   - And sometimes it's not even like work hard,
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.180]   it's just like, it's like be a professional,
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.980]   which that involves like, in his case, at his age,
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:52.020]   with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.100]   and the way he does it.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:53.940]   - For two hours.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:58.240]   - You have, this is a professional athlete,
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.540]   a professional athlete that has to do things
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:04.220]   that are probably designed for 20 year olds
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.900]   and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age,
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.700]   which means like, what do you have to do?
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.540]   Well, you have to probably,
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.460]   he probably has like a whole physical routine he has to do.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:13.780]   - Diet, the whole thing.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.940]   And it's hard.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.180]   Look, if you wanna do great things,
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.000]   you probably have to do hard things to get there.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.940]   - I'm not gonna make you pick,
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.660]   just stick on the stones for one more minute.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:31.740]   But what are some great Rolling Stones songs
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:36.020]   that were impactful to you, lyrically, musically,
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:41.020]   maybe something you like playing, like air guitar?
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.820]   I don't know.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:44.980]   - Probably my favorites.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.940]   I love "Sympathy for the Devil."
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.980]   It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.340]   I love the lyrics.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:55.060]   I love how the, almost a voodoo beat
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.280]   just kind of builds throughout the song.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.340]   That's always been one of my favorites.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.980]   - So in that song, he never mentions devil, does he?
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.020]   No, wait, sorry.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.580]   Like, you know my name.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.420]   - Yeah.
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.180]   - There's like a flirtation going on in the lyrics.
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.700]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.540]   - Here's all the trouble I've caused
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.940]   along the way with you humans.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.820]   And I just think it's really, really great.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.700]   - And musically builds really nicely.
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:21.540]   - Yeah.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.420]   - It's like both fun and dark.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.580]   It's cool.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:25.420]   It's a,
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:30.980]   there's a playful nature to it.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.780]   It's, that's very stones,
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.300]   only they can pull it off 'cause it's like playful,
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.140]   but it's also like dark and cool.
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:38.980]   - Dangerous.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:39.940]   - Dangerous, dangerous, yeah.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.820]   - Yeah, and "Gimme Shelter."
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.660]   - "Gimme Shelter."
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:45.820]   - Is just, you know, and to this day,
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:48.380]   when I listen to the studio version
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:53.380]   and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings that epic,
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:58.380]   iconic part, and there's a documentary that was done
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.540]   about backup singers, phenomenal.
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:06.820]   And it tells the story of that moment
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.180]   in that song with Mary Clayton.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:13.180]   And it's just her voice and the way it unfolded,
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.700]   they got her out of bed at like 10 o'clock at night in LA.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.780]   And she's like, "The Rolling Stones?"
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.500]   And went in and just killed it.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.100]   And I can't sing at all.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.740]   I'm by ordinance not allowed around a microphone.
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.180]   So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that.
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:37.900]   But, you know, those are some of my favorite
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.460]   Rolling Stones songs and "Paint It Black" is awesome.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.620]   I mean, I could go on.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.020]   - Yeah, "Paint It Black" is great.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.980]   Again, a song that builds, it's badass.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:48.340]   I mean, it defines a whole generation.
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:49.580]   What made you pick up a guitar?
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.740]   What made you fall in love with the guitar?
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.060]   - It's just the coolest instrument, right?
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:59.220]   I mean, when you watched back then, you know,
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.660]   and I was kind of an old soul.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:06.660]   I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters,
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:11.900]   Robert Johnson, Lightnin' Hopkins, B.B. King,
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.860]   and just the soulfulness.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.020]   - Thrills gone.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:19.460]   - Oh my God, I mean, B.B. plays five notes
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.820]   and just kills it.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.100]   And the emotion that it evokes.
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:29.100]   So I just was just in awe of the instrument.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:34.380]   And, you know, I also, there's always somebody around
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:37.540]   who's a musician that just picks the instrument up
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.300]   and can play, right?
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.260]   And they're just so talented at it.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.940]   And they can just listen to a record and play it.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.780]   That was never me.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.940]   I never took formal lessons.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:52.020]   I had to grind, you know, to just make it sound
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.260]   like I wanted it to sound.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:58.180]   - So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I could hear it.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.380]   And what they call, you know, you play.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   So my right hand, you know, the rhythm side of it is,
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:13.180]   that's probably, if I have anything, my strength.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:18.100]   But there's something pretty amazing that happens
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:22.500]   when you get together with other people and play a song
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.860]   in that moment where it hits the pocket
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.940]   and you all kind of know it.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.140]   And it's just such a cool feeling.
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.940]   And it was interesting growing up because I was,
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.620]   again, I always had eclectic interests.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.780]   So I loved math and physics and science.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.100]   So I had those friends and I was an athlete
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100]   and played football and baseball and basketball.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.780]   So I had my jock friends and then I had my music friends.
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.620]   And so it was just kind of that.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.780]   And so when I was still living in Los Angeles
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.780]   and had Legendary, I just missed playing.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.540]   And so I put this band together
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:08.140]   and called it the Ghost Hounds because, again,
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:11.860]   huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.220]   of Robert Johnson selling his soul at the crossroads
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.100]   in exchange for his musical talent.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.780]   - You guys have that in one of the videos.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:20.260]   - Yeah, yeah. - Such a cool video.
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.100]   - Exactly.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.620]   So I always, I just thought like, that's such cool lore.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.340]   I just love the blues.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.300]   So Robert Johnson would often,
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:33.460]   would talk about hellhounds on his trail.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.580]   And so I always just thought, huh, what about Ghost Hounds?
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.500]   So that's, I wish it were a more clever, deeper story,
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.780]   but that's about it for the name.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:44.660]   - That's pretty deep.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:45.780]   Robert Johnson's incredible.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.300]   But you also talk about this,
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.860]   that you connect to the storytelling of blues.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.700]   So what makes a good story in a song?
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.820]   Like what aspects of storytelling connects with you in song?
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.100]   So I'm a big lyrics guy too.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.820]   I love deep lyric people like Tom Waits
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.060]   and people that are like Leonard Cohen,
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.780]   like that are, even Bob Dylan,
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.700]   they're like obviously, yes, poetry.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.500]   And then there's some people like the Rolling Stones,
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.260]   it's like seemingly simpler,
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.980]   but it's still so much more to it.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:23.740]   It's like less is often more.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.620]   It still tells a strong story.
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.820]   - Yeah, and there's certain people,
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.020]   and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are in this boat,
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.940]   Billy Gibbons is in this boat.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:35.700]   They just say things in a certain way
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.260]   that are just cool, right?
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:42.260]   It's just, and so I write our music and lyrics.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.980]   I have to tell a story.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.700]   I have to know the characters in the song.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:51.500]   I'm not good at just writing some rhymes
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.780]   and having it match up to the right key in the right music.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.380]   I have to understand like, that's just me.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.500]   So I think that, look,
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.420]   if you have three or four minutes to tell a story,
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:09.420]   you have to be more efficient with your use of language.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:12.180]   And you have to understand what you're building to,
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.460]   if anything, and evoke emotion.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.660]   And hopefully for those three minutes,
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.660]   get the listener to understand
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.900]   not only the point of the song,
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.540]   but where you're coming from,
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.980]   and to make you feel a certain way.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:31.820]   There's a song that the audience has seemed to like a lot
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:34.380]   on the new album called "Good Old Days."
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.900]   And I wrote that because,
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:39.580]   especially during COVID and reflecting on
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:42.260]   what normalcy looks like
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.580]   and what happens when you're cut off,
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:49.140]   I just was kind of taken with this idea of
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:53.740]   that when you sit around and reminisce with friends,
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:58.740]   oftentimes, it's not just like some big event happened.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.980]   It's, remember that summer,
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.060]   we'd go up to the lake all the time,
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.340]   and it's who you were with.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:09.580]   And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.140]   It just seemed like kind of a normal day,
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.020]   but it was the company you were keeping.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.780]   It was the time in your life.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.900]   It was whatever it was.
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.460]   And it just kind of struck me that right now,
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:24.220]   we're doing stuff that you're going to reminisce about later
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.260]   that seems kind of ordinary,
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:29.140]   but you're like, "Man, that was such a great time."
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.580]   So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.500]   But these are the good old days,
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.420]   and enjoy it and soak it in and kind of be present for it.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.380]   - Yeah, it's a great perspective to take on the present
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.380]   'cause we are in the thing that we'll remember.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.180]   We're living through the thing we'll remember.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.700]   And sometimes the things we'll remember
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.900]   is the simple stuff, the little stuff.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.740]   - Yeah.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   - Outside of Keith Richards,
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:58.620]   who is the greatest, ridiculous question,
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.180]   but just indulge me.
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.180]   Who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time,
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.660]   rock guitarist of all time?
[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:07.220]   - Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.500]   with Jimi Hendrix, right?
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.420]   Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.580]   So I think most guitarists would say
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.940]   Jimi Hendrix is pretty ridiculous.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.140]   - That probably for me,
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.260]   I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:22.740]   - Well, 'cause he can't, you can't.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.780]   I mean, even to this day,
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.220]   I don't care technology, pedals, whatever.
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:31.500]   He just somehow fused with the instrument.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.660]   I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.900]   without mentioning one of the great guitar players
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:40.180]   of all time and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:42.260]   - See, that's how I know you're like a rockstar.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.700]   You're sucking up to the audience.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:44.900]   (laughing)
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:48.060]   - No, but you have listeners all over the place.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:51.140]   Stevie Ray Vaughan is another one of those.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:51.980]   - Yeah, he's incredible.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.620]   - Just blows me away.
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:56.940]   And then with the older guys,
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.060]   I mean, BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:01.900]   - Yeah.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:06.380]   - Clapton's, I saw him on his last tour
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.860]   and just walked out on my,
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:12.700]   just like unbelievable how he still sounds.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.660]   So--
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:16.380]   - And both electric and acoustic.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.620]   - Yeah, he's a master. - Just so strange.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:19.700]   - Absolute master.
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:24.020]   - And the greatest storyteller, you mentioned Bob Seger.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:26.300]   That's an interesting one.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:30.620]   He almost doesn't get enough credit, I feel like,
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.500]   for how great he is.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.300]   Obviously, he's super famous, but--
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.500]   - No, he's, and his voice.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.180]   I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:43.580]   with John Fogerty, you know, John Fogerty and CCR fame.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.340]   And he's another one that's just,
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:48.100]   the way he phrases things.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.220]   And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.000]   Amazing talent.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.900]   I read Bruce Springsteen's book and was,
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:04.060]   I'm a fan, but after reading the book, it was really,
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.820]   you go back and listen to his lyrics
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:10.820]   and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:16.020]   And then again, with the old blues guys,
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:20.660]   I just think the emotion they could get out of
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:23.060]   playing like, staying on the one, right?
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.180]   Just playing the same rhythm.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:30.180]   John Lee Hooker, you listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:36.140]   And it's just, there's something so,
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.140]   it just draws me in every time
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.880]   and the emotion they're able to get out of things.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:44.420]   And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.020]   I just think that sound is, I love it.
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:51.080]   - Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode?
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:51.920]   - I do.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:53.600]   - I do, yeah.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.000]   - That's good.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.280]   - Maybe, you know, one of the great moments,
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.280]   at least of my childhood, was Back to the Future
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.440]   and watching Michael J. Fox plug in
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.320]   and then at the end play at the dance
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.320]   to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.160]   Pretty awesome.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.280]   - Yeah, the guitar is so much more
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.760]   than a musical instrument.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.440]   It feels like, it's like the,
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.420]   in the 20th century, it's like the car.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:22.980]   Like it defines so much of Hollywood,
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.840]   so much of a generation of what it means to be,
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.800]   I don't know, what it means to be a man,
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.100]   what it means to be a human in America.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:32.600]   It's fascinating.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.160]   - It's just emblematic to me of a certain type of music.
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.000]   - Yeah.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.480]   - And that's, I made a documentary years ago,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.440]   called it "Mike It Loud" with Jim Page.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.520]   - I highly recommend that everybody watch that documentary.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.980]   It's incredible celebration of the guitar.
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:53.520]   - Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.360]   - The Edge.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.520]   - And the Edge from U2.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.360]   Okay, all right.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.260]   Well, now you have to tell the story of that one
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.480]   'cause how the heck did that all come together?
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.520]   'Cause it's so fascinating.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.360]   Such different musicians all coming together,
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.760]   talking about their story,
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.520]   talking about how they approach the music
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.760]   and also playing together a little bit
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.360]   in this casual kind of setting.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.800]   - Well, look, one day I came downstairs
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.080]   and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.880]   and it was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.500]   And then I had some other financial report with video games
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.920]   and the top video game at the time was Guitar Hero, right?
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.200]   And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it,
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.320]   but I just, and I said to myself,
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   what is it about the guitar that is so central
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.000]   to the rock and roll, whatever you want to call it,
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.940]   like, why is that the symbol?
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.060]   And I said to myself, I want to ask Jimmy Page
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.240]   why he picked up the guitar,
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.160]   'cause he's Jimmy Page, right?
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.520]   And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim,
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.600]   who had directed Inconvenient Truth,
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.680]   and I think still is,
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.780]   but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.120]   And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.960]   I want to make this movie about the guitar,
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.520]   about different eras and styles and whatever,
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.000]   but I've never made a documentary.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.120]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.440]   And so I was just looking for advice.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:24.160]   And thankfully, because he's one
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.000]   of the best documentarians ever,
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.340]   Davis is like, you know what?
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:30.960]   I can't get this out of my head, I'll direct it,
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.520]   which was amazing.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.560]   And we wrote three names down
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.240]   that represented different eras and different styles.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.760]   Rarely do you get, you know, you go three for three,
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.720]   but it was those three guys.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.720]   And it was just such a incredible experience
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:53.560]   to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.040]   You know, I mean, it was like,
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.560]   and he was like Gandalf, man.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.320]   He was like always Jimmy Page.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.040]   - And-
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.760]   - That was so cool to see him.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.680]   Gandalf was, there's like a wisdom,
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.280]   there's a calmness to him,
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.720]   compared to like the restlessness of Jack White.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.760]   I mean, that combination was just fascinating.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.800]   - It was one of the coolest experiences ever.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.120]   And one of the things, there was a moment
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.240]   where Jimmy, he was going through his guitar case
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.160]   and he had the double neck from "Stairway to Heaven"
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.720]   and he handed it to me and I was like, mm-hmm.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.200]   I mean, it's like somebody handing you Excalibur
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.960]   or something, right? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.120]   - Amazing experience.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.960]   And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.640]   you'll ever meet in your life.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.880]   Just an amazing person.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.040]   And I think he hit it right in the head with Jack
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.840]   is he's got that energy, you know,
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.240]   and constantly pushing himself.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.360]   But it's hard to believe it's been, I think, 10 or 11
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.080]   or maybe even 12 years since it came out, but.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:02.720]   - After watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.320]   And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.320]   It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.760]   like explicitly, we almost didn't acknowledge it.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.680]   How important it was culturally.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:18.500]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.560]   And the way it closed from the song, the--
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.400]   - The Wait.
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.400]   - It was called The Wait, yeah, by the band.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.840]   - That's 'cause they didn't wanna go home.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.000]   We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.020]   for three days when we called it The Summit
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.320]   where the three of them came together.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.000]   And the two things I'll never forget is when Jimmy
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.840]   starts to play the riff from "Whole Lotta Love,"
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   Edge and Jack ceased to be rock gods or whatever,
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.640]   and had the same 15-year-old kid feeling that I did,
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.360]   you could see in their face.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.640]   And then at the end, they're like, hey, can we play?
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.080]   We just wanna, we don't wanna go.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.600]   Can we just play something acoustically?
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.880]   So we printed out the lyrics,
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.000]   that's what they wanted to play.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.560]   And they just sat there and sat on those couches and just--
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.600]   - Such a good way to end.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.440]   - Yeah, it was incredible.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.160]   - What's your guitar rig set up like?
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.360]   You have a few guitars.
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.600]   First, let's just put on the line.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:21.880]   So what's better, Les Paul or Strat?
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.480]   - Well, I'm not gonna get into what's better
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.360]   'cause I'm sure that'll start a flood of whatever.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.880]   For me--
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.200]   - I'm gonna say it's Strat.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.040]   - All right, well, I'm a Les Paul.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.760]   My main instrument is a Les Paul.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.720]   - But I, okay, okay, let me just put it on the table.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.040]   I'm speaking as somebody who literally,
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.680]   I don't think I've ever actually strummed a chord
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.520]   on a Les Paul.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.360]   So I've been--
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.320]   - All right, so you're uninitiated.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.960]   - Exactly, so I don't speak from experience,
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:50.480]   but it's probably because of Hendrix,
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.200]   I'm so deeply influenced by Hendrix
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.200]   that I just kind of followed in his footsteps
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.640]   and clapped and so on.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.120]   - The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.640]   and what the Gibson Guitar Company and Les Paul did
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.440]   in the '50s, those are still the shapes
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.680]   and the perfect thing today, right?
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:12.960]   The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.680]   And they got it right way back then.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.680]   So I have my main guitar, you gotta name your guitar.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.280]   So my main guitar is named Hazel and it's a '59 Les Paul.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.020]   And there's something magical in that year,
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:35.080]   like a Stradivarius, and there's something different
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:35.920]   about 'em.
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:40.440]   So I play that and then I play it through,
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:45.480]   sort of my main rig is either a '59 Fender Twin
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.560]   or a '65 Marshall.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.880]   And then when we're on the road now,
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.920]   'cause when you use older vintage stuff,
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.960]   you just gotta be super careful with the tubes
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:58.760]   and everything, it has to be reliable.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.360]   So very nicely, the guys from 2 Rock
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.640]   sent me some of their amps and they're really,
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.520]   'cause I don't use any new stuff,
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.480]   but the 2 Rock stuff is pretty great.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.320]   So that's actually what I'm using.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.120]   - Oh, it gets close to the sound that you like
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:11.960]   with the Marshall.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.040]   - Yeah, and it's new and reliable.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.440]   So that's what I'm using on the road right now.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.240]   - Do people use emulation?
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.200]   Do they use software or is it still?
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.040]   - They do.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.360]   I personally don't.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.680]   I go, I don't have many pedals.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.040]   I use a Klon, vintage Klon straight into the amp.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:28.880]   - That's cool.
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:29.700]   - That's it.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.000]   - As old school as possible.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.520]   Is there other cool guitars you have that kind of stand out?
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.320]   - I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.120]   from the 50s, which are pretty great.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.000]   - What are those, Blackguard Telecasters?
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.760]   - Yeah, so they just, you know, it's in the 50s.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.880]   - Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.720]   - Blackguard.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.560]   - Got it.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.320]   - But they're incredible, so.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.220]   - What's the color of the Telecaster itself?
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.200]   - Most of them are yellow with black
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.400]   and then they got into different configurations,
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.560]   but there's something, I have a 51 Telecaster
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:04.720]   that I play in Open G, and in songs with Open G,
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.000]   that just, again, there's something, you know,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.680]   and I'll take all the help I can get
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:13.200]   in terms of making it sound great.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.840]   So I'll try to find the magic ones.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.120]   - What's your writing process like
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.640]   for the music and the lyrics?
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.120]   Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.640]   Is there whiskey involved?
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.720]   What do you have to do?
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.880]   Or do you just write a little bit
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.760]   whenever you have a moment of free time?
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.760]   - I'm a boring guy, 'cause I don't drink.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.240]   I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things up
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.760]   plenty on my own without adding anything.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.920]   - That's a good call.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.920]   - But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff,
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.920]   just some, something that I think is an interesting,
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:54.200]   you know, riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.800]   into a little bit.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.720]   And a lot of times I'll write a title
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:02.480]   and love a title and then start to backfill.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.440]   - So the title is almost like an idea.
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.000]   - Yeah, like this is where I want to be.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.280]   And then start kind of writing it out.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.960]   And again, I just have to know,
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:16.520]   am I writing from a character's point of view?
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.880]   Am I writing about someone or something,
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:22.080]   you know, as like the narrator?
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.720]   And, you know, what is this person?
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.560]   Are they happy?
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.380]   Are they sad?
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.320]   Are they, where are they in life?
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.680]   I don't know if all that, like great writers,
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.160]   I'm sure would say, why don't you just write?
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.080]   You don't need all that.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.400]   But that's, for me, that's my process.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.960]   - Well, I'm not so sure about that.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.160]   I bet you quite a lot of writers
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:45.880]   have created a world in their mind
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.760]   before they even put the simplest of words down.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.600]   So yeah, there's quite a lot to that.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.800]   - What's your favorite song to play?
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.920]   Is there some favorite ones you go to?
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.480]   Both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.440]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.760]   - No, you don't?
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.880]   - I'm not, I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:14.240]   And I think, you know, if you come see the show,
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.480]   you won't see a microphone anywhere near me.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.040]   - But do you, I mean, do you hear,
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.400]   like when you're thinking about lyrics,
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.840]   do you hear the idea of the words?
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.680]   - 100%.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.320]   And especially what's great, you know, with Trey
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.600]   is I write for his voice.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.200]   And then we have these amazing backup singers
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.240]   that are just, and I can hear all of it.
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:36.520]   I just can't do it.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:41.720]   And so I'd say to, of our stuff,
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.440]   there's a song called "Half My Fault"
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.320]   that I play in Open G that just,
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:50.520]   I love playing the song, I love that energy.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:53.920]   And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:58.920]   and there's a song called "Baby We're Through"
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:01.280]   and it just stays on the one.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.840]   And if for non-musicians, that means,
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.520]   like in a lot of rock and roll and blues,
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:09.280]   it's what's called a one, four, five progression
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.000]   from your kind of root note.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.120]   And you would hear, if you're a non-musician,
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.720]   if you heard it, you'd be like, oh yeah,
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.480]   that's a lot of songs.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:18.960]   And this song just stays on the same groove,
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.880]   like "La Grange" or "Shake Your Hips"
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.400]   or any of those songs.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.880]   And it's just got this unbelievable energy
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.720]   and it's fun to play,
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.320]   but I have to keep the same rhythmic thing going
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.760]   for the whole song.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.960]   - Well, that simplicity, I mean,
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:36.640]   the personality of the song can really shine.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:41.640]   I mean, Trey's, I mean, that guy, really cool.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:44.040]   It just comes through.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.680]   I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.360]   It's just like, it's just.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.200]   - Yeah, you gotta have that.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:51.160]   And my other guitar player, Johnny Bob,
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:54.360]   is, he's a phenomenal, I mean,
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.360]   like a legitimate guitar slinger.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:03.280]   You know, we probably split the leads 70/30
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:06.680]   and he is just, you know, there's times,
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.380]   sometimes I look over at him and I'm like,
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:09.480]   I'm being a fan right now,
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.780]   'cause what you just laid down is pretty good.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:14.040]   - From a lead perspective,
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.280]   what's the most fun thing to play?
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.560]   What do you, what kind of stuff do you,
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:18.480]   do you like slow?
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.320]   Do you like, I mean, if you, like, thrill is gone.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.040]   There's a, so if you look at B.B. King,
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.840]   sometimes one note just bending the shit out of that.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.080]   What do you call that, vibrato?
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.720]   - Yeah, if I'm gonna play the lead,
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:30.320]   it's a certain kind of feel.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:33.880]   Slow blues is probably my favorite to play
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.480]   or something that's got a little more
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.840]   of that Chuck Berry drive
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.040]   where you can be rhythmic in the lead.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:44.360]   You know, I can't, the shredding thing
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.600]   that those guys do is, that's not my.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.360]   I was actually always able to do that really well.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.560]   Like you mentioned people that pick up,
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.840]   like maybe it's the classical piano training.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.860]   I could play super fast in guitar, super technical,
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:01.080]   but to me, the hardest thing and the,
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.580]   my favorite thing is, it's just,
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:06.360]   has probably less to do with the guitar
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.980]   and more living on life that's worth playing a guitar for.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.640]   It's like a certain kind of emotion
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.520]   that you can put into the notes.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.000]   And that has to do with bending notes.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.800]   Well, like bending notes is a whole other art form of,
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.440]   I worked surprisingly a long time on "Comfortably Numb."
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.960]   And there's, so David Gilmour does a lot of bending
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.320]   and they're simple, they sound simple,
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.320]   but the dynamics of them to express like a buildup
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.800]   in the way it's held and there's often a vibrato
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.360]   at the top for a bit, just that,
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.920]   it's almost like a sigh and a sigh of relief
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.640]   and the buildup, I mean, it's just the,
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.120]   that's an art form for him that's hard to get right.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.240]   It's not just playing a note, playing a note,
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.680]   playing a note, it's in that like dynamic movement
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:06.400]   of a note that so much can happen.
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.360]   That's where the blues just happens to.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.440]   It's, look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too, right?
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.520]   And you listen to these guys
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.960]   and they're, you sit there and they're like,
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.520]   "Man, you're playing in a small range on the neck."
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.900]   But in, it's like, I know the notes you're playing
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:30.400]   and I'm playing them too, but not like that, right?
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.480]   I mean, it's, and Gilmour is certainly one of those guys.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.040]   It's incredible guitar player.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:40.560]   - And yet another chapter of an amazing life.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.120]   You love football, like you meant, you play football?
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:43.960]   - Yes.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.780]   - What position did you play?
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:45.620]   - Wide receiver.
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.200]   - Wide receiver, awesome.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:53.200]   So maybe we can talk a little bit about your love of football
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.760]   and the fact that you are part owner
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:00.800]   of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.640]   - Yeah.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:02.920]   - So, I mean, where do we start?
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.280]   We start at the beginning, let's start at the end.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.840]   Why the Steelers?
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.640]   What attracted you to the, first of all,
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.640]   I think, not to be controversial,
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:15.960]   but one of the best uniforms in football
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.080]   in terms of just the black and gold, just.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.880]   - Decal only on one side.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.880]   - Yeah, it's great.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:23.120]   - Yeah, the helmet.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.080]   Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.560]   I grew up in upstate New York
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:32.440]   and the first football game I ever saw
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.760]   was the Steelers in the Super Bowl as a really little kid.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:39.960]   And it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.920]   and Franco Harris and those guys were like,
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.680]   came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something.
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.560]   And I just was enamored with the team.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.820]   And because we only had three channels,
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.120]   the only time I'd get to see them
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.800]   is occasionally when they were the game of the week
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.640]   or something.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:01.760]   And I just loved, to me, what they stood for,
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:04.160]   the toughness and they played football,
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:08.160]   the way that I thought was great.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.060]   I was a huge Jack Lambert fan,
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:14.000]   our Hall of Fame linebacker
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.800]   who just intimidated everybody.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.360]   - So that was like the decade of the Steel Curtain.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.560]   I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.600]   in football history
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.480]   and also one of the greatest football teams period
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.360]   in football history.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.220]   - I've been a lifelong fan.
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:38.760]   And was very fortunate to meet Mr. Rooney.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:43.000]   The Rooney family started the team in 1933,
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.580]   got to know him and just was asked to be
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.740]   part of the ownership group.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.520]   I think it was the end of 2007.
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.500]   First year as part of the group in 2008,
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:59.500]   we won the Super Bowl and it was like beyond surreal.
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.860]   I mean, just beyond surreal.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:06.860]   And it's amazing to be able to do.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:10.860]   I mean, the Rooney family is one of those
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:16.780]   most revered in sports for the way they conduct themselves.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:20.980]   Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now,
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.940]   and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league.
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:27.300]   I mean, put the league as we know it together.
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:29.860]   More importantly, was a civil rights champion
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.380]   who created what we now call the Rooney rule
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.020]   to make sure that we're being fair
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:40.460]   about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:44.700]   And just is one of the most kind
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:47.880]   and amazing human beings I ever met.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:51.860]   - It's incredible what sport does
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:55.980]   to bring out the best in people,
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:58.300]   to give people hope, to inspire people.
[01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.860]   There is something about football
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:04.860]   that has all the elements of a great sport.
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:09.860]   It's the teamwork, it's the sort of the combat aspect of it.
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:11.860]   It's the purity of it.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:16.860]   It's of strength and power and speed,
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:22.580]   and all the elements of last minute close calls
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:25.120]   required to win the game.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.780]   And where referee decisions,
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.340]   of course that's essential for a sport,
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:30.980]   can screw up the whole thing.
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.860]   Just got all of it together, I think.
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:37.020]   I don't know, it gives the drama
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:40.100]   and the triumphs are just beautiful.
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.540]   Like some of my favorite memories,
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.740]   I don't know if it's an accident
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:45.700]   or this is common with people,
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.400]   is just with friends watching football
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.060]   and connecting over that.
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:54.240]   - Yeah, well, look, it's an incredible game
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.140]   because there's nowhere to hide, right?
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:57.740]   You're out there on the field.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:02.140]   You know, it's a great game that requires
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.380]   not only all those attributes that you said,
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:07.620]   but it's incredibly complex game.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:09.220]   So if you don't know what you're looking at
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:12.420]   and you don't understand how complex defenses
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:14.940]   are trying to disguise what they're doing,
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:17.100]   offenses are trying to overcome that,
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:22.100]   and you can set up one play in the entire game,
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:26.980]   but a team that plays well together, right?
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:28.340]   Knows their plays inside and out,
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.420]   knows their assignments inside and out,
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:33.980]   can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:38.980]   because of that aspect of working together.
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:43.020]   One of the things that I always loved about sports
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:47.260]   is just you're out there, there's a set of rules,
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.000]   and there's a scoreboard.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.900]   So at the end of that game, it says,
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.440]   and you can make excuses about the refs
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.620]   or this happened or that happened,
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:00.620]   but at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?
[02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:05.700]   And when you went out and were a competitor,
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:07.780]   how did it work out, right?
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.740]   And the simplicity of that and the purity of that
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:15.220]   is something that I always have been drawn to.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:18.820]   - What about the business of sort of owning a team
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.020]   or putting together a team
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:23.940]   or trying to build up a team that's going to be a great team?
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:25.340]   What are some interesting aspects
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:27.740]   that people might not realize that you can carry over
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.920]   from all the other experience you have in business?
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.220]   - I think the hardest thing about professional sports,
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.740]   right now it's individuals getting paid money
[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:42.900]   to play a sport, which is different than,
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:45.120]   it's certainly different than amateur.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.440]   And the decisions that are hard
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.620]   is when you get to know somebody
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:52.100]   who's a player on the team
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.180]   and either they're at the end of their career
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.300]   or you need to go in a different direction.
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:03:00.820]   And that person who's done everything that you've asked,
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.900]   whatever the coaches have asked of that person
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.920]   and you get close to them.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.020]   And then when they have to be traded, released,
[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:12.100]   or whatever happens, that's sad.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:16.820]   And being able to stand back
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:21.100]   and in some ways be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:25.860]   I'm on the Baseball Hall of Fame board
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:29.620]   and one of the guys that's on the board of me
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:30.620]   is Jerry Reinsdorf.
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:32.860]   And I think it was Jerry who said,
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:35.420]   if you act like a fan, you'll be sitting with them,
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:37.820]   which I thought was kind of funny.
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:40.620]   - Well, I got to push back on that a little bit
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.740]   as by way of a fan asking a dumb question.
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:46.240]   (Jerry sighs)
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.220]   Okay, let me just give some examples.
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.580]   It's very common in sport.
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:54.380]   It's funny you said this example of like
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:57.380]   certain great players going to another team
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:59.020]   right at the end of their career.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:02.980]   And it always makes me sad.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:04.340]   It almost makes me wanna wish
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.440]   that he kind of retired right there.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:10.860]   From a perspective of just like,
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:15.500]   do you ever as a owner, but just in that space,
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:18.740]   think about like the Steelers
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:21.620]   in the full arc of human history?
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.360]   So not like as a business.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.180]   Okay, this question might be absurd.
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:28.660]   - I don't have to think about it as a business.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.500]   - You could just be almost like a fan.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:30.500]   - I'm a minority owner,
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:33.100]   so I can think about it almost as a fan,
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.100]   but I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:35.420]   - Yeah, that's what I mean.
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:38.420]   I suppose this is a dumb question to think of,
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:42.980]   like of a business in that way,
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.980]   not just investment, but like legacy of like,
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.860]   what footprint would you leave on this world,
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:52.740]   on this history?
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:55.980]   - That is one thing that I can say unequivocally.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:59.420]   And I only have the experience that I have.
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:02.460]   But one of the things that I'm so proud of
[02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:07.700]   about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is,
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:08.940]   and that's the Rooney family.
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:10.620]   That's the legacy of the Rooney family
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.500]   is asking constantly about what's right for the league,
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.020]   what's right for the players,
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:19.060]   what's the right thing to do here?
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:22.180]   And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:23.020]   all the time.
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:25.420]   So I think that legacy is important
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:29.620]   because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right?
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:31.700]   Belongs to those fans
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:35.380]   and the owners are the custodians of that.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:40.380]   So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:43.580]   to the fans, the memories that it creates,
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:47.660]   the bonds that it creates, it's a responsibility.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:55.020]   And I think that you do have to think beyond the,
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:57.140]   certainly not just dollars and cents,
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:02.140]   but just sports is a very big deal in our society.
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:06.700]   And it has to be, I think, held to a standard
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:11.820]   that's not just, well, were we profitable this year?
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:14.820]   There are other businesses for that.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:16.220]   It is certainly a business.
[02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:19.220]   I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not,
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:22.260]   but to me, it's more than that,
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:24.820]   or at least my experience has been that it's more than that.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:27.620]   - It's a source of meaning for millions of people.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:32.140]   Like, and you see that most like during COVID, for example,
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.740]   when there's so much desperation,
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:35.500]   so many people losing their jobs,
[02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:37.300]   so many people having to deal with the uncertainty
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:38.980]   of what the future holds.
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:42.140]   There's something about sports that just unites us,
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:47.140]   that again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport,
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:50.780]   of uniting, of gathering together with your friends,
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:54.100]   with family, shared experience of over like this,
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:58.180]   yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team,
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:06:59.940]   for your city, ultimately.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.300]   And the access, again, as I alluded to,
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.340]   we didn't have anything when I was growing up,
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:07.820]   but I would pour through the box scores.
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.380]   I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan,
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.740]   and feeling some ownership of that, right?
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:16.340]   That I could read the box score and relive what they did
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.940]   and occasionally see them on TV
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:22.540]   and feel like I was part of that celebration
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.220]   when they won and everything.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.220]   It's a very powerful thing.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:29.540]   - You've been exceptionally successful
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:32.020]   in a bunch of avenues and a bunch of efforts.
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:34.780]   What advice would you give to a young person today,
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:38.260]   a high school student, a college undergraduate
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:42.580]   that's thinking about career,
[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:44.940]   maybe advice, not about just career,
[02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:48.040]   but about how to live a life they can be proud of?
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:51.780]   - You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty,
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:55.140]   and to me, that's the first step of just saying,
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:57.180]   to the best of your ability, who am I
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:07:59.980]   and what's important to me
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:01.980]   and what do I want to do and accomplish?
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:05.100]   If you can start with that
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:10.060]   and develop some sort of rules-based philosophical,
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:14.100]   here's what I'll do, what I won't do.
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:18.240]   And that way, you can be flexible and pliable
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:19.220]   and you're going to need to be,
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:24.220]   but if you still have a compass that tells you,
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:28.300]   hey, at least I know this is the path I'm going to take,
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.940]   I think that's very important.
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:33.020]   - The rules you're referring to, the principles,
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:35.780]   that's kind of like underlying integrity.
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:38.820]   So knowing what lines you don't cross on this path.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:39.940]   - That's exactly right,
[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:42.780]   because if you have those absolutes,
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:46.260]   there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly,
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:49.060]   right, because, hey, that's not for me,
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:53.980]   or, hey, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z.
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:56.340]   And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:57.420]   It's kind of interesting,
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:00.100]   you mentioned earlier in the conversation
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:03.380]   about slippery slope and that's how often it happens,
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:07.820]   like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.940]   It's a slippery slope of little adjustments,
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.700]   you put stuff off.
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:13.940]   And I found that to be,
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:19.780]   I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:22.740]   very much in my life, but I still encounter them.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:25.340]   That's what integrity, I think, looks like,
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:29.060]   is as the slippery slope is happening,
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:33.260]   those little things is without drama,
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.980]   without making a show of it,
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:38.620]   making a decision that stands behind your principles
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:40.340]   and just walking away.
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.940]   - Yeah, and besides the big ideas,
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.100]   I'm going to change the world, I'm going to innovate,
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:48.100]   I'm going to do all those other things.
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:51.340]   I also start, if I'm giving any advice,
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:55.860]   which we can debate whether or not I should be giving advice
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:59.100]   but just in terms of, well, let me start with this.
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.140]   Are you a good friend?
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:02.860]   Can you be counted on?
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.220]   Do you do what you say you're going to do?
[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:09.740]   Are you accountable to what you sign up for
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:12.100]   and do you hold others accountable?
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:13.740]   What does all that look like?
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:18.740]   And then I think it's being as intellectually curious
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.140]   and well-read as you can be.
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:24.540]   We live in a world that is designed to distract you, right?
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.540]   And being able to sit with your thoughts
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.860]   or go on a walk and think deeply about something
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:34.660]   and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.620]   and we decide the fate of the world
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.080]   based on a couple of text messages or something.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:46.580]   You don't want to lose touch, I think, with being well-read
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:50.740]   and understanding and standing on great thinkers shoulders
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:55.360]   and learning from those works.
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:00.360]   And then I also think that there's resiliency
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.340]   and then there's grit.
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.420]   And I heard someone say one time
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:06.860]   that those are slightly different.
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:11.400]   And I'm also, I know that there are all kinds
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.260]   of challenges in life, right?
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.700]   That are tragic, that are unfair.
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.300]   There's no question that's the world we live in.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.100]   But for me personally, to try as much as possible
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:26.900]   not to be in the victim mindset
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:30.700]   because unfair things are gonna happen.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:35.700]   And we all wanna live in an idealistic, just world.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:38.800]   That should be what we aspire to.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:41.460]   I haven't seen that yet.
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.020]   I haven't experienced that yet.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.140]   But yet you still have to function in that world.
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:52.140]   So, I think that that resiliency thing is very important.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:56.900]   And then putting yourself out there, right?
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.900]   Because if you play scared and you're always afraid to fail,
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.760]   you know, this is probably a dumb way
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.120]   to get to the end of the podcast.
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:08.660]   But there are times, especially I'm out West,
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:12.400]   I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho,
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.660]   places like that.
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:16.060]   And when you look up at night, it's almost like
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.260]   I've never seen anything like this before.
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:21.200]   'Cause there's no light pollution, so to speak.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.300]   And sometimes when I look up, the most daunting problems
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.860]   that I'm experiencing, I'm like,
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:30.860]   those things have been there for a billion years
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.200]   or whatever and I'll be gone and it doesn't,
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.420]   you know, the most famous person on earth 200 years ago?
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:43.800]   So, you know, it's pretty fleeting.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:48.040]   And so make sure you have a good journey
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:50.520]   and especially coming out of COVID,
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.700]   I think telling people that you care about
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:56.120]   that you care about them and maintaining and cultivating
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.840]   your friendships and relationships
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:00.740]   and they're not just transactional, right?
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:04.760]   And making sure that someday when you're laying there,
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:07.020]   you can say, yeah, I was a good family member.
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:10.180]   I was a good friend.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.000]   I was someone that could be counted on.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.740]   I think all those things go into the mix of, you know,
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:17.520]   however you want to take the journey.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.000]   - So when you look up to the stars,
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.080]   do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.560]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:26.080]   Do you think about your death?
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:27.860]   Are you afraid of your death?
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:30.420]   - I'm a huge fan of stoicism, right?
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:32.600]   I read a lot of stoicism.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:35.880]   I think Ryan Holiday has done a great job
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.920]   of bringing some of that back into the forefront.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:43.420]   It's just really thought provoking to me
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:45.720]   and rings a lot of it rings just hits me
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.680]   and says, I think that's right.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.680]   And that momento mori thing, which is,
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.040]   hey, we're all gonna die.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.280]   So you should contemplate it.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:58.720]   There's a finality to this thing.
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:03.040]   And so I think if you can rightly frame that
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:07.360]   between fretting about it every day and being afraid
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.400]   and being so laissez-faire that you think,
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.060]   you know, you're gonna live forever,
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.920]   it'll influence some of the decisions you make.
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:19.160]   It'll influence the way you attack things
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.400]   and hopefully the way that you live your life.
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:28.180]   So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:30.400]   and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent,
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.800]   but because I read a lot of stoicism
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:36.940]   and just I think it's right to pause and say,
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:38.720]   who knows, right?
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:41.300]   There's gonna be an expiration date.
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.960]   And if it happened tomorrow,
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.720]   have I done the things I wanted to do?
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.120]   And am I the person I wanted to be?
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.080]   And I think it's important along the way
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:53.840]   to check those things.
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:58.440]   - Yeah, I try to make sure that I actually visualize this,
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.360]   that I'm okay dying at the end of the day,
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.120]   at the end of each day.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:05.480]   Like if this is the last thing I do in my life
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.760]   is talking to you.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:08.700]   - Oh, good Lord.
[02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:12.860]   - I'm happy.
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:15.160]   I know you're joking, but I, you know,
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:19.600]   that yeah, I'm happy I get to live the life I do.
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:20.760]   And I think moment to more,
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.120]   I think the Stokes have it right.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.400]   So you, and you have it right in saying,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.920]   meditate on death enough to remember
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.480]   that this ride ends pretty quickly
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.360]   to help you appreciate every day
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.680]   and the people you love, the people close to you
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:39.320]   and the cool shit that you're doing in your life,
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:40.800]   the cool shit you're creating.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:44.240]   And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall,
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:48.640]   are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow.
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.720]   You are the man in so many disciplines,
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:52.980]   so respected, so successful.
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:54.520]   It's truly an honor.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.500]   You sit down and talk with me today.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:59.800]   Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:01.960]   and for talking on this silly little podcast.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:02.840]   - Oh, it's great, man.
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:04.360]   I'm a huge fan of the show
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:06.760]   and have had a great time hanging with you
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:09.280]   and really appreciate it.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:10.800]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:12.040]   with Thomas Tall.

[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:21.360]   from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.540]   You can't always get what you want,
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:25.040]   but if you try sometimes,
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:27.500]   you might find you'll get what you need.
[02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:29.360]   Thank you for listening
