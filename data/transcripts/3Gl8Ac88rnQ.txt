[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   The world's so complex and we really underestimate that complexity.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   And if you're going to like digitize processes and automate them and stuff,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.480]   you have to capture all that complexity basically at the bit level.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360]   And that's extremely difficult.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.240]   So you just have to write like more and more code basically.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.780]   And so that's why we don't see like runaway productivity growth from
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.520]   software is because we're fighting, you know, all this increasing complexity.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.120]   Have you heard of the water vet theory of complexity, by the way?
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.120]   I don't think so.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   There's like a fixed amount of complexity in a system.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.520]   And if you try to reduce it, what you'll end up doing is just, you'll end up
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.100]   migrating the complexity elsewhere, right?
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.640]   As your program grows, that complexity exponentially grows of all the things
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.560]   that could go wrong when you're making two things interact that are in a way
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.960]   that you, you were expecting not to.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.040]   So yeah, the, the idea is you can just choose where to have your complexity,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.720]   but you can't get rid of that complexity.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.800]   It's arguably now creating software is actually the most complex thing we do.
