[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Well, every Christian is faced with hard decisions about who we will and who we will not spiritually
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   associate.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.600]   Today, we take up the topic and talk about John Piper's affiliations, who he hangs out
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.240]   with, and why, what conferences he speaks at and why.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.040]   Pastor John, I know from our private conversations on the leadership team here at Desiring God
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.520]   that you have given a lot of thought to this topic of who you partner with.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.880]   You let us read a personal document you wrote that lays out your own thinking here, and
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.260]   I was wondering if you could walk us through that thinking on the podcast today.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.880]   Over the decades of ministry, how did you decide about how broad your associations would
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   be?
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.400]   I know there are listeners who wrestle with this issue, even if your position as a Christian
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.440]   leader is uniquely different.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.720]   If you could, for listeners of the podcast, explain your convictions here.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.480]   What might be most helpful is for me to describe how I have made certain decisions about the
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.280]   degree of unity I expect in the various settings that I'm part of and why I've made those decisions.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.360]   I should say at the outset that most of these decisions that I'm going to talk about for
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   the next few minutes are not explicitly demanded in the Bible.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.600]   I believe they're informed by the Bible.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.880]   I've tried to do it that way, but they're not the kind of decisions that cause me to
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.440]   say not everyone should do it this way.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.960]   I'll mention six kinds of associations over the years with other believers that I faced
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   as expectations for leadership came my way, kinds of togetherness where I had to make
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.720]   decisions who I'd hang out with and who I wouldn't.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.880]   As I mentioned, think of them as concentric circles moving outward with the first most
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.440]   inner circle being the one where I expect the most agreement and the sixth and farthest
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.680]   out circle where I expect the least agreement in those I'm together with.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   Here's the first one.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.840]   My elders and staff of the church where I was the lead pastor for 33 years.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.680]   As much as it lies in my ability and my power, I'm going to work in that setting for deep
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.800]   and detailed theological unity as well as ethical unity on biblical convictions on major
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.520]   issues as well as ministry philosophy issues like a strong commitment to world missions,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.480]   youth ministry that's not biblically empty fun and games, worship services that are serious
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   joy and not living room casual slapstick howdy partner kinds of gatherings.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.200]   The reason for the tightness at the staff and eldership level is that we together are
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.000]   charged to teach this body of believers what is biblically true in doctrine, what's biblically
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.880]   right in behavior, and we need to pull together as an eldership.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.720]   The less important doctrine is to a pastor, the less he'll care about this kind of unity.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.920]   I'm sometimes appalled at how some pastors say they can have a staff that are all over
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.360]   the map theologically.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   I think that's possible because his preaching remains distant from the specifics of the
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.040]   text and distant from doctrine.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.240]   I think this breeds weak churches that become mirrors of the culture sooner or later.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.380]   Another reason this kind of philosophical unity and ethos unity is needed among the
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.940]   elders and on the pastoral staff is that we have to make choices that are not specifically
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.320]   prescribed in the Bible.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   You have to.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.980]   Will women do the pastoral prayer?
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.220]   Will worship leaders wear torn jeans?
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.060]   Will we encourage coffee in worship?
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.000]   Will the youth bob for apples in a toilet bowl filled with mellow yellow?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.840]   And a hundred other choices that are not laid down explicitly in the Bible.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   And without a significant ethos and philosophical unity, the conflicts on the staff can become
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   unlivable.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.940]   It almost goes without saying here, but not quite, so I'll say it, that with all this
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:05.920]   theological and ethical and philosophical sameness, unity, I really do want personality
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.280]   diversity and ethnic diversity on the staff and the elders.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.840]   That's because my own limitations in personality have to be compensated for in others so that
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.160]   the people are helped by having people of different personalities on the council.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.880]   Secondly, church planting network that I support and I'm part of, so this is the next concentric
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.420]   circle outward.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.360]   We have one life to live, and we have to make choices about what we think will make the
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.960]   greatest impact for the glory of Christ and the good of the nations.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:58.920]   And when I ponder where my church planting energies should go, my answer has been, I
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.440]   want to plant churches, I want to be a part of that movement, churches that believe our
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   elder affirmation of faith.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.340]   So the Treasure in Christ Together network of churches that has grown up consists of
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.080]   churches whose elders affirm these truths.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   It's a pretty significant affirmation of faith.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   It's the same one we use here, desiring God.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.400]   On the other hand, the philosophical and the ethos dimensions are not as tight in my association.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:45.080]   I don't have pastoral oversight in those churches, and so I don't exert that kind of influence,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.120]   and I'm willing to live with that.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.240]   Behind this choice, this measure of unity and diversity at the church planting level,
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   behind that choice is the conviction, and I could be wrong about this, that over the
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:12.040]   long haul of, say, 30, 60, 100 years, the greatest good will come through greater doctrinal
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:19.560]   faithfulness than through greater numbers of churches which are doctrinally diffuse.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.320]   That's a conviction that I've operated with.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.160]   I hope it's true.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.920]   Third, conferences that I'm responsible for leading.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.340]   Now that would include, for example, the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors that I was basically
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.600]   responsible for from 1988 to 2013, as long as I was the pastor there at Bethlehem.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.680]   And here, my tolerance level of differences was greater than with the elders and the church
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   planters.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.140]   And the reason for this is that the people who came to speak at these conferences with
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.680]   specific assignments, they came with specific assignments, and they don't have significant
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.900]   influence in the conference on numerous other issues where there might be some significant
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.200]   differences between us.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.420]   Nevertheless, it makes a difference to me what the speakers believe and how they live
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.400]   and lead outside the conference.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.420]   I would not want to have a speaker who was outspoken and widely influential on issues
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.320]   that I regarded as harmful or unhelpful to the church.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:40.280]   But I have invited speakers who were less Calvinistic than I but didn't foreground this.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:48.560]   And my rationale for this wider diversity was that the spirit of wider fellowship with
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.380]   doctrinally serious people with a manifestly high regard for the inerrancy and preciousness
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:04.020]   of Scripture would, in the end, in the long run, commend the more rigorously biblical
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:10.340]   theological vision that I was trying to spread over those 30 years.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:17.420]   In general, I wanted to promote the truth and the beauty of the doctrines of grace and
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:24.220]   the preciousness of serious God-centered worship and the radical commitment to a lifestyle
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.580]   of global missions.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:32.420]   I looked for people who loved the vision of God that I cherished, even if they did not
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.180]   fully understand it in some cases or replicate it.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:43.060]   And now only God knows whether the strategy that we chose was the most effective, but
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.780]   that's how we made our choices.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.820]   And I'm sure I made some mistakes in that process, but you do the best you can.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.940]   Fourth, fourth concentric circle moving out, speaking at other people's conferences.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.620]   How do you make decisions there?
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.660]   I've experimented on this, being unsure about the implications.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:09.940]   In general, I avoided generic conferences that cared little for doctrine, let alone
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.840]   Calvinistic doctrine.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.340]   I wanted to invest in people and ministries that wanted to advance the importance of biblical
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:23.060]   reformed truth, not just vanilla evangelicalism.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:30.940]   A few exceptions I would not repeat would be a leadership conference that I went to
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.580]   where I was followed.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.020]   You won't believe this.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:41.500]   I was followed by an effort to set a new world record on the numbers of people sitting on
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.420]   whoopee cushions.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:57.060]   And there were a few other fiascos like that, which some of our listeners know about.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:04.020]   I tried to balance and with lots of input from the Desiring God team, like you, Tony,
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:10.580]   I tried to get input for the downside, the upside of being part of a conference that
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:17.060]   might not foreground all the truth and method I prefer versus the upside of speaking the
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:24.100]   truth I love into a new audience who may not even know who John Piper is.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.580]   And I think sometimes in weighing the pros and cons there, I think sometimes we got it
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.180]   right and sometimes we didn't.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.860]   But that's how I tried to go about it anyway with concentric circle number four.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.180]   Here's number five, participating in debates and conversations, public and private.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.460]   Now, this would include, say, public debates like the one I had with Greg Boyd on open
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:54.860]   theism or the one with Sam Storms and Wilson and Hamilton in eschatology.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:01.100]   It would include private group gatherings behind closed doors or phone calls with groups
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.940]   to deal with issues.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.860]   It would include whom I choose to write against or for.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:15.060]   I wrote a whole book against N.T. Wright's view of justification and another one against
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:21.900]   Robert Gundry's view of imputation, though I hold these men in very high regard for much
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.900]   of their work.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.560]   So those aren't always easy calls to make.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:35.020]   The only limit I would put on such togetherness in debate or conversation is that it needs
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.720]   to hold out real promise for doing good.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:45.940]   If I thought that my presence with a teacher that I thought taught error, even to debate
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:51.860]   him would give an unhelpful prominence to his views, which they didn't already have,
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.780]   I probably would decline just because I didn't want to foreground or lift up the prominence
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.740]   of his error.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.360]   I dislike books, by the way, and discussions that give the impression that theological
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.500]   views are like grocery shopping and you can just choose among many brands of cereal without
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.240]   too much harm.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.020]   I would not be inclined to be a part of those kinds of discussions or publications.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.300]   So here's the last, widest concentric circle.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:29.100]   Events like a pro-life rally where I and others are asked to pray and, say, give a five-minute
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.260]   meditation.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.940]   This is as wide, I think, as I've ever gone.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:42.460]   It excludes multi-faith prayer services where the interfaith focus pretty clearly communicates
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.700]   that the participants agree that all these paths to God are legitimate—Muslim, Hindu,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.460]   Baha'i, Jewish, Christian.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.460]   They're all the same.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.260]   Let's just all pray to the same God.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.940]   I've never been a part of one of those services.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:06.100]   But the pro-life rally does include Roman Catholics who pray and speak alongside me,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:13.260]   and I regard Roman Catholicism as a serious, harmful aberration from the true gospel and
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.620]   the true church.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:23.620]   And the reason I go is that in my judgment, fallible as it is, few, if any, among these
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:29.260]   hundreds of people think that my presence at this pro-life gathering shows that I am
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.660]   soft on Roman Catholicism.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.460]   I could be wrong about that, but that was my rationale.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:44.900]   So wrapping it up, what I think all this comes down to for me is making the judgment call
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:54.660]   about whether a strong, explicit, joyful, Bible-saturated, Reformed, complementarian
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:02.580]   commitment shaping and guiding my preaching and speaking and publishing and organizational
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:10.380]   leadership—whether prioritizing doctrine like that will have the greatest impact for
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:17.020]   fruitful evangelism, multiplying of healthy churches, reaching of unreached people groups
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:26.420]   globally, the faithfulness of radical prophetic witness to the culture, earnest love and holiness
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:34.900]   among God's people, or whether those aims would be better accomplished in the long run
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.860]   by a more muted doctrinal focus and a bigger tent of partnerships.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.060]   That's been the question for me.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:51.340]   And given what I see in the Bible, in the foregrounding of truth in the Bible especially,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:59.780]   and what I see in church history, I don't think doctrinally minimalist movements have
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:07.240]   the Christ-exalting, God-centered, staying power or transformative power that spiritually
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:14.420]   vital Reformed, complementarian, rigorously biblical movements have.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.820]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.500]   And when you speak of youth bobbing for apples in a toilet filled with mellow yellow, I mean,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.900]   your imagination is either very vibrant or…
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900]   That is not imagination.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.900]   That's not imagination.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   You're speaking from experience.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   I am.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.900]   All right, don't out anybody.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:37.220]   Let me see if I can transition from that into some sort of a close here.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.780]   Thank you for joining us today.
