[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   We had a guest on this podcast, Jim Hollis, he's an 84-year-old, probably 85-year-old
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.120]   Jungian analyst on, and he just brilliant guy.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.100]   He's written some really important books under Saturn's shadow and etc.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960]   And he said, you know, so he has a real kind of like suit up, show up, you know, get to
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.360]   work kind of mentality, but he also is a very reflective person and he said, you know, if
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.820]   there's one simple key to life, it's that one understand that most of our daily lives,
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.200]   our waking lives are in stimulus response, but that it's so critical to take 10 to 15
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.080]   minutes each day to just get out of stimulus and response and either to just let stuff
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.260]   geyser up out of our unconscious, subconscious mind, or to just put some real thought to
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.540]   something that, you know, most everybody is in stimulus response.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.080]   I wonder these days with social media and so many things, filling the space between
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.520]   walking to the car or with the pro players that you work with, you know, I'm guessing
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.320]   the moment they're on the plane, they're on their phones and texting and all these things
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.760]   are wonderful technologies, but they fill all the space with stimulus response.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.160]   They fill all the space with stimulus response.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.040]   And you know, it's not unless you go to a place with no wifi accessibility that you
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.200]   suddenly realize like, wow, like in most of modern life, we're just constantly in this
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   tennis or ping pong match with this trivial thing and that trivial thing.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.560]   And some of it's essential, but that there's no quote unquote space anymore.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.840]   In many ways, my life is built around creating that space.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.040]   And it's interesting, when I was playing chess, I experimented with studying chess from everywhere
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   between 45 minutes a day to 16 hours a day to see where the sweet spot was.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.880]   And what I came to was about four and a half hours a day.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.560]   But that four and a half hours a day was like a 10 out of 10, like fucking just on fire.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.040]   And then the rest of the day became about cultivating those four and a half hours.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.320]   And my life today has that kind of rhythm as well.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.880]   And, you know, training, like I've spent many years working with people who are just brilliant
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.600]   in the investment space has been a really interesting way because it's a great laboratory
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.200]   because people are very driven.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.240]   They want to, they're all in, they're motivated, they'll take themselves on.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.960]   And it's a great place for me to, over the last couple decades, to like refine the art
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.440]   of training because I don't like solving for motivation.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   That's one thing.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120]   And I think part of that relates to that quirky dynamic from when I was seven that I described
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   of always being the target and so never having, like not taking on my weaknesses that was
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.560]   outside of my conceptual scheme.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.880]   And so in many ways I don't, I haven't really had to struggle with motivation myself, for
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640]   better or worse.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.760]   And I love working with people, partnering with people who are all in, who want to take
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   themselves on.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.160]   I don't love having to motivate people.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.320]   And so a great laboratory for me is with people who have all sorts of problems, who might
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.120]   be obstructed but who are all in.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.240]   And like you're working with world class investors and what, you know, they're grinding themselves
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.880]   out 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.500]   Doing less is a huge part of doing much more.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.720]   And you start to see like they might be at, like if you think about a 10 out of 10 as
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   being like in terms of like when they're at their very best creatively, they could slip
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.680]   from like a 10 to a 2 and not even notice.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.240]   And then you begin to cultivate an awareness of where one is in one's creative spectrum,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   right.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.880]   And then you start to cultivate the art of stress and recovery and like amping oneself
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   up and then releasing.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.080]   And you see that the ability to turn it on is directly connected to the ability to turn
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.720]   it off, as you know.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.960]   If you walk into a fight gym and you study a bunch of fighters in the match, one great
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.480]   read you can make is looking at the depth of physiological relaxation when the guys
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   aren't fighting.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.380]   And you'll see who the highest level fighters are.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.640]   The best guys, man, they can turn it on with wild intensity, but their bodies are so mellow
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.920]   when they're not going.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   And then men, like they're so efficient.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's so, that oscillation, that range is so huge, right.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.480]   But people don't cultivate the art of turning it off in order to learn how to turn it on.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.840]   You know, for many, many years, decades, I've been practicing what I call now the MIQ process,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.080]   most important question process.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.360]   And the essence of it is it's what I came to as the most potent way so far that I've
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.880]   found to train analysts or thinkers in mental arenas.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.160]   You're training people in the art of discovering what matters most.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.840]   If you look at, if you talk to like a great chess player actually looks at less than a
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   lower level chess player, but they look at the right direction.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.960]   So you might think a great chess player, people often think like, oh yeah, I can calculate
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.660]   50 moves deep, 100 moves deep.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.660]   It's all irrelevant.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.660]   Move two was inaccurate.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.360]   So it was just all an illusion.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.960]   The great chess players might look at much less, but they're looking in the most potent
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   directions.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.240]   The lower level chess players are lost in a sea of complexity, right?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.320]   So if you're working with like, let's say, a scientist or an investor or whatever, them
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.480]   straining their mind for what is the most important question, ideally to begin the practice
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.200]   toward the end of their workday with like a release, a recovery period with full intensity
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.640]   in a peak performance state, stretch one's mind for what matters most and then release
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.240]   it.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.460]   Release the workday completely.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.000]   Don't work all night grinding yourself out at a low level.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   Release and then first thing in the morning waking up pre-input, return one's mind to
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.860]   the critical question and brainstorm on it.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.880]   It's very powerful because you're opening up the, you're systematically opening the
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.080]   channel between the conscious and the unconscious mind.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.640]   You're feeding critical questions to the unconscious, which is processing overnight.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.960]   And like, I know you know all this, like the consistency with which you come up with an
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.520]   insight in the morning is incredible.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.200]   Interestingly, and you'll probably know why much more than me, improved dreamer call often
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   happens simultaneously when one starts to have more and more insights about the MIQ
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   in the morning, which is fascinating.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.000]   Then over time, you can have micro-manifestations of this throughout the day before going for
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.880]   a workout, before taking a walk, before taking a break, before taking a piss.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.000]   Instead of going, when you're gonna go to the bathroom in the day, instead of like checking
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.200]   your phone while taking a piss, you pose yourself at MIQ, you release it.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   You do not do anything but piss in the bathroom and breathe and then return to the question
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   and you'll have an insight.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.240]   Right, so you're learning to just oscillate between the conscious and unconscious states
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.280]   and you're opening up that channel and you're practicing stress and recovery.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.560]   And then your physiological workouts are also stress and recovery all the time.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   So you're building that theme in everything that you do.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.840]   And you realize that like when you're at your very best for four or five hours a day, you're
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   doing multiples of the work that you're doing if you're just grinding yourself at, you know,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.600]   what I've called in the past a simmering six or whatever for 15 or 16 hours a day.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.920]   And so people can do so much more in less time.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.200]   And my lifestyle is based on that.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.320]   You know, I'm training very intensely physically and I'm doing really intense mental work and
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   I oscillate between them in beautiful ways and I have a lot of empty space for reflection,
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.120]   for meditation, for like zoning my mind on what matters most.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.200]   It's about quality, not quantity.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.360]   But it's so interesting how we live in this culture where just quantity is just consuming
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.320]   everyone.
