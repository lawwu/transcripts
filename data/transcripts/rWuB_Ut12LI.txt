[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   And nobody shared this with me my whole life until one day I realized it's like,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.660]   Oh yeah, we start off everybody.
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.300]   We start off trading time for money.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.940]   And then if we get smart and more valuable, then we trade money for time.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.040]   And then if that works out really well, and we get good at that, then we have
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.300]   an excess or like overcapacity of capital to then invest, to have our
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.080]   money work for us and that's freedom.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.980]   And that's what people are after.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.640]   They're like, Hey, I want to, I want to show up every day and I want to create an
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840]   outcome so that one day I don't have to work.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.760]   I can decide if I want to work.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.100]   You, the, the, I get to is actually a real, it's not a mindset thing.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500]   It's actually like a reality.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.640]   And that's where I think life gets really interesting when you wake up and you get
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.680]   to decide what you want to create on.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.620]   Um, but it starts by just becoming more valuable so that you have the resources
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.020]   to be able to buy back more time to then become more valuable again to the market.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.320]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.280]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.180]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.240]   I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research to help you
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820]   get the best experience in life.
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.180]   And one of those things is managing time.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.440]   And time management guru, Laura Vanderkam, who I've had on the show before, has a
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.660]   new book called Tranquility by Tuesday.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.600]   I thought it was a good book that offered nine rules to help people
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.420]   spend more time on what matters.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.400]   But there was one expression in the book that really stuck out with me.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.800]   "We should all be time millionaires."
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.820]   And that sounds great, even better than being a money millionaire, maybe.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.020]   But how does it happen?
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.960]   People can't just create more time in their day, unlike money.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.880]   So what's the secret?
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.840]   And that's where today's guest can help.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.200]   His name's Dan Martell.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.840]   He's a good longtime friend of mine, and he has a new book about just this.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.040]   It's called Buy Back Your Time, Get Unstuck, Reclaim Your
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.760]   Freedom, and Build Your Empire.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.820]   In his years as a successful entrepreneur, after a rough childhood
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.580]   and a few run-ins with the law, he built five companies, sold three of
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.220]   them, and currently runs SaaS Academy, the world's largest coaching
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.900]   program for founders of software as a service businesses.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.140]   But you don't have to have founded a business to apply these principles.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.020]   You can make every aspect of your life better by buying back your time, and
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.500]   Dan's going to talk to us about how.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.220]   We're going to talk about why buying back time has become his superpower, why
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660]   mindset is such a key part of buying back time, how anyone can learn from
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.580]   super successful people like Oprah or Richard Branson about how they've
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.620]   increased their productivity, and more importantly, their fulfillment in life.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.500]   I want to talk also about how you can create a playbook at work or home to
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   codify how you do something, and also to help someone else do it for you.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.980]   We'll also touch on why almost everyone should consider hiring some type of
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.500]   administrative assistant, and how Dan uses a house manager to take care of
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.900]   nearly every aspect of his family's life, and ways that you can start to
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.380]   implement pieces of that in your own.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.020]   There'll probably be a lot more.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.180]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.220]   Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.020]   Thanks for being here.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.620]   Chris, it's an honor.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.780]   I'm super excited.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.140]   This is the podcast I've been wanting to do for a long time, just because I know
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.620]   your audience is nerdy as much as I am on this topic.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.540]   I want to start letting people know who's coming on to get questions, because
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.100]   I'm sure people listening now would have great things.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.140]   So that's something I might kick off in 2023.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140]   But I want to jump right in.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.260]   Saving time, freeing it up, buying it back with help from
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.580]   others is your superpower.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.300]   We've talked about this before, both in work and life.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.340]   I want to hear how you got so good at it, because it's something that so many
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.900]   people struggle with, and also why you think it's so important that people
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.580]   start doing it, no matter where they are in their stage of life.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.500]   I learned this the hard way.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.740]   I've been a business builder, tried to be an entrepreneur growing up.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.140]   Failed for 7 years.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.100]   Just tried.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.380]   And when I was 24, I found a different gear.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.460]   Sounds crazy, but I read my first business book.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.340]   Turned out to be a good move.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.820]   And then I actually hired a business coach, this guy named Bob.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.340]   He was an E-Myth certified coach.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.140]   And Bob taught me a lot about business.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.980]   And when I was 24, I started this company called Spheric.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.620]   But what happened for me is over a 4-year period, even though we grew a lot, we
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.180]   became a multi-million dollar company within a couple of years and grew to
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.260]   about 40 employees and won a bunch of awards, I just got really good at being
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.500]   productive, I didn't understand how to think of time and energy and just how I
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.740]   was showing up as a brother and a son and a partner in life and as a friend.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.780]   And what happened was, I was working at the office on a Sunday morning and I
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.340]   was supposed to be back around 11 o'clock.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.340]   I was engaged to a woman at the time and we had just bought a house.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.700]   And before I knew it, it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.540]   And I was like, ran home and walked into the house and I found my fiance in tears.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.420]   And she just was beside herself.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.300]   And she just looks at me and decides that that was that.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.980]   And she just goes, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.460]   And takes the ring off and drops it on the counter.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.820]   And that was that.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:24.220]   She walked out and 7 weeks before our wedding, and my life just shattered.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.300]   Because I think anybody that's done anything from working hard at their
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.260]   job to taking risks in a business, they don't do it really for themselves.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.180]   I was doing it for her.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.980]   I was doing it for our future, our lives that we were going to build together.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.180]   And that was when I had to look in the mirror and ask myself,
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.780]   "There's got to be a different way to approach time."
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.100]   Because there was a 6-month period, Chris, that I actually thought that maybe
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.300]   because I'm so driven in life and I was so horrible, I would go to birthday
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.180]   parties and bring my laptop.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.660]   And that was normal.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.700]   And I would think to myself, "I'm the best friend ever because I'm so busy that I
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.620]   showed up and I'd sit in the living room on a laptop while everybody else is
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.540]   enjoying music and partying."
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.660]   And it was just crazy.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.260]   And that was the moment where I started reading books around leadership and
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.020]   personal development, really diving into that component of it.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.220]   And I just realized that it's not just about being super productive, even though
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.460]   I think I've gotten world-class at that.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.300]   I've read all the productivity books.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.020]   It's really about understanding how your energy flows throughout your calendar and
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.180]   your week and your month and your quarter and all these things so that you can show
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.060]   up to the work or the people in a completely different way.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.700]   And that's why I wrote this book.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.740]   It's just become such a foundational part of my life that if we fast forward to
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.500]   today, I have 2 incredible kids.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.060]   I have dinner with them every night.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.860]   I do quarterly retreats with my wife.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.420]   We go to seminars, personal development programs together.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.980]   I think I did 12 weeks of vacation this year, and I'm the CEO of two 8-figure
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.860]   companies where I wake up and push things forward.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.780]   And there was no way that I could have done that if I didn't go through that
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.140]   painful moment to force me to learn the lessons that I share with people today.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.500]   Well, it sucks that you went through it, but I know that you're now in a good
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.020]   place, and I'm fortunate that you learned those lessons so you can share them with
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.380]   us. Where do you think people start with this?
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   Because I think when I just heard you describe all of the stuff that you're
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.540]   doing now, my head kind of doesn't know how to compute it.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.140]   Right. I'm like, well, I just have this one small little thing.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.980]   That's a podcast. It's not an 8-figure company.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.820]   It's just one of them.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.700]   And, you know, I don't have that much vacation.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.940]   My wife and I don't go on these retreats.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.460]   So it just seems impossible.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.540]   It kind of is, and I forgot to mention, I also did three Ironmans this year.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.660]   So like, it's kind of nuts, but Chris, we don't start there.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.020]   Like, it's not where I started.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:09.260]   I think the big thing for people to understand is that their calendar is telling
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.620]   them a story of what's important to them.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.940]   And I tell this to people all the time.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.700]   It's like, if you show me your calendar, I will tell you what is important to you,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.500]   not what you tell me is important to you.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.140]   So every time that I, you know, I work with a lot of at-risk youth and I just
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.820]   even do the same process with them is we do a calendar audit, right?
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.260]   We look at what I call a time and energy audit of where are you actually spending
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.020]   your time and allocating that and try to create a life that's by design, not by
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.820]   default. And I think that's like a first principle.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.460]   Like there's no way I can teach you all the ways to get more time.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:53.020]   But if you don't at least, you know, admit to yourself that, "Hey, you have to be a
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.380]   little bit more proactive. You got to be a planner.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.980]   You need to look at your time and assess and have a period of reflection to ask
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.940]   yourself, like, was this a good use of my time?
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:10.220]   Did it deliver not only the success impact that I would like it to have in my
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.660]   career or with my friends, but did it also bring the joy, right?
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.860]   Like one thing I do every year at the end is I look at my previous 12-month
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.780]   period and I look at all the things I said yes to and I did and then I go like,
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.860]   "Okay, what were the best experiences?"
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.820]   And then I go, "Okay, what's true about those ones?"
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.860]   And one example in my life is I don't go on vacation unless there's a physical
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.380]   component to what I'm doing.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.020]   Even if it's like, you know, I've had people like, "Hey, come to Europe and let's
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.180]   go drive supercars."
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.100]   I'm like, "Eh, what else?
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.740]   Like, are we going to go hike a mountain?
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.940]   Are we going to do a 3-day bike trip?"
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.900]   Like, it literally, I just like had this feedback loop.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.580]   And that's for me.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.100]   For other people, they're like, "I have no interest in doing that.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.940]   But, you know, riding around in supercars in Europe sounds fun.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.540]   Let me do that."
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.980]   Like, I'm just saying, if we don't have a process of reflection, then there's no
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.820]   way you can be proactive and that's where it starts.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.500]   It's with the calendar and it's not just a productivity thing.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.660]   It's an energy thing.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.380]   Because this is the cool part, Chris.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:21.740]   I learned that the energy that I bring to the work can have a 3 to 4 times increase
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.180]   in output.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   What do I mean by this?
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.300]   Well, if I have...
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:32.060]   If before I start doing a creative project, I'm full of self-doubt and frustration and
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.860]   anxiety and all these negative beliefs and I'm in low energy, the thing I'm creating
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.540]   literally has an impact.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   And it's so funny because I see that where it's like, "Okay, if you're organizing
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:51.180]   an event and one of the tasks for you to do is to go and recruit sponsors, if you just
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:57.260]   got in a fight with your better half because you forgot to do something, that energy shows
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.060]   up in the emails.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.260]   It shows up in your language.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.380]   It shows up in your body.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.060]   And it's just so fascinating that people don't consider that.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.860]   So for me, I'm always looking at the work I do.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.260]   And I just use a green highlighter and a red highlighter.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.660]   It's like this gives me energy and this takes my energy.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.980]   And as much as I can, I try to remove the things that take my energy so that I'm stacking
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:24.860]   this positive energy flow to the work because it literally will have a 2, 3, 4 times amplifier
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.060]   to the outcome I'm after.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.700]   And I'm sure there are things, especially for anyone listening who has a job and they're
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.900]   not the boss, that just take the energy out.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.780]   Are there certain places or times a day where you put those things?
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.340]   Yeah, I think everybody's different.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.500]   I think, Chris, maybe you can relate to this with the new family.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.900]   Before I had kids versus after I had kids.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.260]   I used to be somebody that was more of a night owl.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.260]   And then I would start my day later.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.540]   And that was okay.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.700]   So maybe I would get to work and I would jump into meetings and then do some more creative
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.140]   work in the afternoon.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.140]   And then what happened is once I had these human alarm clocks, my 2 sons, and they're
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.020]   11 months apart.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:13.260]   So imagine having kids, it was bananas, which was another forcing function to get really
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.460]   good at the stuff I talk about.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:20.220]   What I do now is I do all of my creative work in the morning.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.300]   And I mean, maybe if your boss tells you what to do with your time, but I know my team,
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.820]   we focus on outcomes.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.900]   We don't tell people what they should do.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.260]   Sure, there's meetings they have to be at, but they're responsible for their own calendar.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.100]   So if you can design it, the energy flows, what works good for me is all my creative
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.780]   work I do in the mornings.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.660]   I try to push out any in-person conversations till later on.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.180]   I personally like to work out at lunch because it creates a reset.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.220]   And then I bring that reset energy into the afternoon conversations.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.980]   And then I batch.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.660]   I mean, there's so much stuff we can talk about around just getting more out of the
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.380]   time we have.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.540]   But understanding and just asking people...
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.100]   So it's so funny because a lot of times, I'm managing my leaders and they're talking to
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.780]   me, "I'm overwhelmed.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.900]   I don't have this and this."
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   And then we do a time and energy audit with their calendar.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.340]   And it's really just about negotiating constraints in an interface.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:25.180]   A lot of people have the ability to call somebody up and say, "Hey, I know we have this meeting
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.860]   every Tuesday at 9.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.020]   Is there any way we can move it to 11am?"
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.900]   Because it's the only thing that's breaking up my morning.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.580]   And if I had an extra hour and a half and uninterrupted, not broken up time to work
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.140]   on some creative projects, I really think I'd be more effective.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.900]   Most people would be like, "Yeah, it actually doesn't change my life."
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.620]   And if that's going to support you, game on.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.980]   So I just think trying to understand how you like to work.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.300]   And then the key is to honor the calendar.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.860]   It's like, I know what my week looks like.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.940]   And I review my calendar the night before and try to tweak anything that needs to be there.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.660]   And then when it shows up, I put my work in the calendar,
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.100]   even if there's nobody else involved.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.580]   I literally... My to-do list is in my calendar.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.660]   And I just honor what I put in there.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:15.180]   I think too often, people drag their feet, spend a little too much time on TikTok or
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.220]   Instagram, whatever.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.780]   And then that thing that they had an hour blocked out of, it's really 35 minutes and
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.660]   they're rushing through it.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.460]   So there's that.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:30.140]   But if you have the discipline and you're proactive, then I think that energy management
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.660]   flow is actually more productive than just saying, "I'm managing my time and I'm being
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.540]   productive in my time."
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.500]   And that's what shifted for me after my fiancé left me and I had to rebuild my life, was
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:46.780]   now I structure things so that when I transition in between meetings, I can be 100% present.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:55.260]   Because before, I was just dealing with arguments and friction and what I call emotional shrapnel
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.020]   that often I was creating myself.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:03.980]   And if you're not a planner, I have one of my best friends, an amazing human being, but
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.380]   gosh darn it, this guy is so forgetful and not a planner.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:14.300]   The amount of times that I've seen him lose 2 or 3 hours, I've seen him drive 8 hours
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.740]   to go pick something up because he forgot and he needed the next day for something.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:24.300]   And I just think to myself, "Man, if he just spent a little bit more time measuring twice,
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.020]   cutting once, he would get back 2 months of his year.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:35.020]   He would pull forward 2 months of productivity into his calendar year for a fraction of the
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.300]   time invested."
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.140]   So again, it's emotional shrapnel.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.340]   It's self-inflicted.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.740]   You're literally throwing hand grenades off in your life.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:48.460]   And then you're dealing with the fallout of it just because you just haven't built that
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.540]   skill set and that discipline of being a little bit more disciplined.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.220]   So 2 things.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.860]   One, I encourage anytime I have a meeting that gets invited to me, especially if it's
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.860]   a recurring meeting at work.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.180]   And I guess technically, I'm not at a company anymore.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:09.180]   But when I was, if they didn't select the "Let guests modify events" button in Google
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.260]   Calendar or I'm sure on whatever calendaring system, I immediately fall out.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.660]   But I say, "Hey, I know this meeting is not for a couple of weeks.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.900]   Can you enable this feature?"
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.820]   And I had it enabled by default.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.500]   So I'd encourage everyone to make calendaring easier to just ask everyone to enable that
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   feature on any recurring meeting so that you have the ability to move it without having
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.260]   to say, "Hey, can we move it?
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.380]   Now we got to go back and forth spending on Slack or email."
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.180]   Just enable that.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.140]   So that's one.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.860]   Two, you talk a lot about discipline, but let's talk about what happens when I sit down
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.220]   and I've got 30 minutes blocked off to go plan the next episode I'm going to do.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.780]   And there's a million other little tiny things on a to-do list that I could go try to knock
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.020]   off that seem easier to make progress on.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.340]   How does that discipline work for you?
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.100]   What makes that possible?
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:05.100]   I think what's unique if you watch the way I work is I actually take all those projects
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:11.260]   or things that are in my calendar and I break down the tasks of the work I'm going to do
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.100]   in the calendar description.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.900]   So everything that is creative output that I need to do, and I'm literally looking at
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:25.820]   like 17 projects I'm working on, they already have the mini tasks inside of it broken down
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.300]   because most people procrastinate because they don't have clarity as to what the next
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.340]   action item.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:37.260]   So it's like if the thing says 60 minutes to go recruit sponsors for an event or some
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.540]   play or whatever it is, right?
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.980]   And in it, it's like, "Send 5 emails."
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   You're literally that descriptive.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.980]   You're like, "Send 5 emails to this person.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.180]   Call John.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.620]   Ask him about this."
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:56.300]   I write it all down and go probably a little bit like, I would say, 120% of what would
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.380]   need to happen for the goal to achieve.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.300]   So I always try to give myself a little bit more tasks to do.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.060]   That way, if I don't get to it, or if I do get to it, it's just like it increases the
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.580]   probability of the thing happening.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:15.500]   But I'll tell you, because I coach so many CEOs, when we do these calendar audits, and
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.860]   I'm like, "Why didn't you do that?"
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.700]   They're like, "I mean, the truth was, I didn't actually know what I needed to do."
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.580]   And it's like, "Cool.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.620]   Here's what we're going to change."
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.540]   Not when you got to do the work, but as you plan your week.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.460]   So for me, I do them on Sunday nights.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.700]   And I know a lot of people are like, "Look, you're asking me to work Sunday."
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.620]   It's like, "You can do it Monday morning if you want."
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.980]   But Sunday night, I grab all of my...
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.860]   I look at my projects and I grab the big rocks and I put them in...
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.220]   For me, my mornings.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.020]   And I put them into typically 90-minute blocks.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.460]   That's about as long as I want to work on one project for until I get bored with it.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.100]   And I outline in that 90-minute blocks, all the stuff I'm going to do.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.140]   And I just keep a note file and I just copy and paste it.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.740]   And I work through that list.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.100]   So Monday, I might attack it.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.820]   Tuesday, I'll attack it.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.860]   Wednesday, I'll attack it.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.620]   And I'm just working through that list.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.540]   And literally, as I get done that 90-minute block, I'll just edit it for the next day
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   because it's shorter because I got a bunch of stuff done.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.060]   And then that way, when I sit down, there's no procrastination.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.140]   Because like you said, Chris, it's like,
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.940]   "I know I have this other to-do list that I can go get some wins on."
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.700]   But technically, your big project is a to-do list.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.820]   And if you just break it down, then you just attack that one and you can get some wins.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.820]   So you can build momentum because I always got frustrated
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.580]   in software development land that I grew up in.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.420]   "Dude, it would take like months to write code to get a product built."
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.940]   Whereas this other guy who works in construction,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.580]   he literally sees every day when he's done the progress he made.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.020]   And it feels so good.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.500]   I know that when I was helping my dad growing up,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.620]   build a deck or redo a roof or whatever.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.700]   It was like it felt so good to make these small wins.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.380]   That's how I've set up my life.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.980]   I just want to take the bigger outcome, break it down into projects,
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.460]   break those down into tasks, put it in my calendar.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.900]   And then I just follow and I honor it.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.620]   And look, if I get the wrong list and I get some feedback,
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.700]   it's like, "Oh, I thought I would do this and that didn't work.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.140]   Next time, I'll just change it."
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.860]   But it just allows you to build momentum with your day.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.660]   And I think that's what a lot of people are missing out of.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   And it is the lack of clarity.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.820]   People procrastinate because they don't have clear...
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.980]   "Boom. This is what I got to go do. One. It's 15 minutes. Let's go get it done.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   Let's go get a small win. Let's build some momentum."
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.300]   And then that momentum becomes almost addictive.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.220]   I just get excited about how much can I get done in a period of time
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.900]   and how can I look for leverage?
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.700]   Yeah. Leverage is going to be a bulk of this discussion.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.460]   But before, I want to know,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.060]   do you keep a separate to-do list or is the calendar the to-do list?
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.140]   I keep a to-do list.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.980]   So I have a high-level Google Doc.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.180]   Okay, it's called to-dos.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.780]   And what's unique about it...
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.260]   And this is how I'm able to unplug at the end of the day.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:59.900]   So now I'm blessed to have an executive assistant that manages 99% of my inbox.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.300]   But things that do end up in my world,
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.340]   what I do at the end of the day is I take anything...
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.060]   That's why I like the world we live in where it's all linkable.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.460]   Anything that I need to process the next day,
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.100]   I put it in the to-do list and I link to the email.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.620]   So it's literally... It'll say "Reply to Chris" or whatever it is.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   And I link to the email in my Gmail.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.380]   And then I grab that.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.140]   So I put it in the Google Doc.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.340]   And then I grab, let's say, the 5 or 6 that are there.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.020]   And I put it in my calendar the next morning for a 60-minute block.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.780]   And it'll just say "Process to-dos."
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.580]   And that way, again, this is how I want it defined and easy.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.700]   So I open the calendar and I just open up all my tabs.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.460]   I just open up just those emails.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.820]   See, that's where a lot of people get stuck.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.300]   They open up their inbox and then it's like "Burp, burp, burp."
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.260]   All these things they got to do.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.820]   I just open up the tabs to the thing.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.300]   So it's like, it could be like "Review a copy for a blog post."
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.860]   Or it could be like whatever it is.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.300]   But it's like a sauna.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.980]   It's like a link just to the thing.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.420]   And when I'm done, I close the tab.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.860]   So I create this almost like momentum I'm building
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.660]   because I start on the left side and I work through them.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.460]   They're prioritized.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.220]   And it's either emails or projects or creative stuff
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.780]   or some mirror document I got to prove or look at.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.580]   And then because I put it in that Google Doc at the end of my day,
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.580]   at the very end of my day, that's the last thing I do
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.700]   is I look at my inbox.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.740]   I look at my projects list.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.020]   I move them into the to-do, copy, paste, and put in my calendar.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.260]   Dude, I sleep like a champ.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.980]   I don't want to brag, but I use Oura Ring.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.820]   I'm literally going to pull up my Oura score right now.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.340]   I got last night...
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.380]   Because people see me wake up so early and they're like, "When did you sleep?"
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.860]   I got an 88 yesterday, which is a pretty beefy score.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.220]   But I've been rocking 88s, 90...
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.420]   I got a 91.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.300]   So I've got the...
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.420]   Yeah. So I don't toss and turn.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.820]   My brain doesn't worry about forgetting stuff
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.340]   because I've locked and loaded it into my life and my calendar.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.820]   Now then... So that's the to-do list, the Google Doc that I...
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.060]   And what's unique is at the top of it, I have all my
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.940]   25-year vision stuff in 5 years in 1 year.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.980]   I'm a little crazy like that.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.980]   I don't worry about the how, but I do know what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.340]   Like I wrote down that I wrote this book 6 years ago.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.060]   I wrote down "best-selling book, business category."
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.220]   And I stared at it for this long until 2.5 years ago, we started working on the project.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.340]   But that way, I'm looking at the big vision stuff 25 years from now,
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.100]   10 years, 5 years, 1 year.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.860]   And then my to-do and my calendar has to map.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.820]   I've got to be able to see what I'm doing this week and how it drives to those outcomes.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.940]   Specifically, you label them to it?
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.820]   Or just because it's at the top of the doc, it's a constant reminder?
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.100]   Because it's at the top and I scan it every morning as part of my process.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.620]   So before I work on any of the to-dos, I just read through them.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.860]   It's almost like it ramps up into my mind.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.420]   It's like, "Oh yeah, don't forget. This is why we're doing it."
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.900]   And I use... Again, I have very unique, I think, approaches that work for me.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.020]   I call it RPM.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.660]   I always focus on results, then purpose, then the activity.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.460]   So a lot of people focus on the "how."
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.420]   I focus on the "what" and the "why" first.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.660]   Because I've learned a long time ago, the purpose of why I'm doing something
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.740]   actually matters more than the actual outcome that I'm trying to achieve.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.500]   So my vision for my life is help a million at-risk youth.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.700]   So mentor them.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.740]   So that's a big one.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.180]   Build a 3 billion multi-generational wealth.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.100]   These are big things, but that's where I'm at.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:45.100]   And so I can go through those and build 30 million coaching company,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.860]   which we're well on our way by 2025.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.860]   So that's the vision stuff.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.780]   And then RPM is my different things.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.700]   So I have my high-speed ventures, $100 million fund.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.660]   I've got my book.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.180]   It literally says right there, "Buy back books at New York Times bestseller."
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:04.060]   Back end, I have specific outcomes of those things, my coaching company.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:10.220]   Then it breaks down into quarterly projects that I've committed to, to achieve these things.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.900]   So like big vision this year, quarterly projects.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.180]   And then I have my to-do list.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.100]   Oh, and I also have a waiting on.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.780]   This is another little secret tip that I like, which is...
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.940]   I don't worry if people get back to me because I take...
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.420]   If I send something to you, and it's really important...
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.660]   I only put stuff in my waiting on list if it's things that are going to affect my goals.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.060]   But let's say I email you.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.220]   I'll literally grab that sent email and put it in my waiting on list.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.660]   And I'll do the same thing where I'll open up all the waiting on,
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.460]   maybe 5 or 6 people, and then follow up.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.620]   So some people use software for that, follow up whatever tools.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.980]   But I just do it that way.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.420]   And that way, I can visually see it.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.260]   For me, it's just superhuman.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:53.900]   Remind me.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.940]   So if it's a thing I don't care about, I'll archive it.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.940]   And if it's a thing that I'm like, "No, this is really important.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.780]   I want to..." in 2 weeks, remind me.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.580]   In 1 week, remind me.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:08.380]   I do think that I haven't found a good way to merge the to-do list in the email.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.420]   Because 50% of my to-do list is email.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.700]   Or it lives in my inbox, maybe, is a better way to frame it.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.060]   That's why I take it out.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.660]   I don't want it in the inbox.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.860]   And that's where... I think there's tools like Motion is a new one that I've seen.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.220]   Facebook ads about taking your to-dos and put them in your calendar.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.420]   But I just either manually do it or I have my assistant do it.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.620]   Because we talk often about like, "Here are my top projects."
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.260]   And I use color coding in my calendar to know
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.420]   if I'm allocating the right amount of time for different projects.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.660]   So that's another little hack I use.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.500]   So if it's like this, it's like 1, 2, and 3 are the most important to me.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.300]   I can visually look at the color coding we're using in my week to know if I'm
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.820]   allocating the right amount of time to move certain projects forward.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.740]   My book is orange right now.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:03.340]   And the calendar is pretty orange because it is a top priority for me.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.100]   Well, I'm excited.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.140]   I got a chance to read it.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.180]   I want to jump into the theme because it's one thing to be productive.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.540]   I've talked about it a little bit.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.820]   I love hearing the way you think about your time management.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.140]   But time is a limited resource.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.580]   And one of the only ways to get it back is to try to find ways to outsource what you're doing
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.500]   so that you have more time to do what you want.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.940]   So let's talk about it.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.540]   I know one of the things that I want to start with is around mindset.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.860]   You bring up mindset a lot, especially when it comes to buying back your time.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.460]   So maybe let's just talk about a few of the objections I think some people hear
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.340]   or think of when they think about this concept, which is like, "Well, I don't have the time to go
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.940]   find someone to help me with all these things.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.260]   I don't have the money to spend on this.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.500]   And no one can really do it like I can."
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.740]   So are there other big ones?
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.700]   Or how do you think about all the objections people have before we jump into the tactic?
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.340]   So those are the top 3.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.660]   And we can overcome those beliefs.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.140]   The other one that comes up often that is unexpressed but is underneath the surface
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.420]   is "I don't feel worthy."
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:14.460]   And that one, I coach not a lot, but I've coached especially women CEOs.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.740]   And they seem to struggle with it a bit more around...
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:25.900]   And the language that I hear is like, "I just feel guilty that I can't run my company and
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.460]   take care of my household."
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:35.580]   Or like, "I'm worried what my mom is going to say or my mother-in-law or my neighbor."
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.420]   It's really fascinating to hear that.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   But the truth is, everybody's got their own limiting beliefs about the world that's going
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.740]   to stop them from achieving more.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.060]   It doesn't matter if it's like getting more time back or being successful in your career.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.580]   You have to understand that your beliefs about how the world works and
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.700]   how we respond is what's stopping us.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.100]   So the one of like, "I don't have time."
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.180]   Well, you decide what you do with your time.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.900]   So it's changed the language to "I choose not to make time for this."
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:15.980]   As soon as you change the language from "I don't have time" to "I choose not to make time."
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.820]   That's an honest conversation that you can then address.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.140]   But most people will blame an external factor and say, "I just don't have time for that."
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.260]   It's like, "No, you do."
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.740]   Because if we looked at your calendar and I asked you, "Tell me what you did yesterday."
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.100]   There'll be things that you chose to do instead of working on this problem.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.220]   So let's talk about why you're choosing not to do it.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.820]   So that's the first thing.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.020]   And by the way, you can apply that to so many different aspects.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.820]   I was talking to someone the other day who's like, "I would love to lose 10 pounds."
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.100]   I was like, "Would you really?"
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.620]   Because losing 10 pounds is not some mythical thing that is really hard to figure out.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.540]   A combination of diet and exercise...
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.700]   It's a caloric deficit over time.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.020]   So you can do it.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.860]   So don't say that you would love to do it.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.540]   Because say, "I wish I had the time to do it."
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.420]   Well, not even that.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.580]   How about, "I don't want to prioritize it right now."
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.700]   It's not important.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.220]   Because if it was important, you could just do it.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.060]   So I think when I hear, "I still catch myself up in this.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.740]   It's hard to get over it."
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.140]   I feel like just as humans, we're trained this way.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.500]   But yeah, you do have time.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.100]   Just how do you want to prioritize your time?
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.380]   What's important to you right now?
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.140]   If it's not, that's okay.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.860]   But just be honest.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.220]   Yeah, I was...
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.620]   I know.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.660]   I mean, it's on that line.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.060]   I was coaching a client, Carrie.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   And she was complaining about, "I don't have time to go to the gym."
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.020]   It's like she knew what she needed to do.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:35.740]   And then it's like...
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.340]   Then we talked about it.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.060]   It's like, "Well, why?"
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.100]   Like you said, it's like you're choosing not to do it.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.460]   You know the benefit of it.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.620]   There's some friction there.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.940]   There's some blockers we need to work through.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.820]   And once we work through it, then it was like, "Okay."
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.100]   And it's this language of even "I get to" versus "I have to."
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.300]   I really think that a rich life...
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.740]   It's not about money, but let's just call it a rich life versus a poor life.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   A rich life is somebody that wakes up saying, "I get to do this."
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.900]   Whereas a poor life is somebody wakes up and says, "I have to do this."
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.100]   And it's such a subtle thing, but it will literally transform your life.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.620]   If you say like, "I get to work out.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.740]   I get to go to work.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.060]   I get to drop my kids off at whatever.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.300]   I get to work on this project."
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.820]   And these are things that you think are tough or hard, or "I don't want to do it."
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.700]   But it's like, "Yeah, let's reframe the stuff."
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.740]   So on the belief, "I can't afford it's another one."
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:40.780]   Here's the way I think about it is every person has the ability to create value with their time.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.460]   It's why we have jobs, right?
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.020]   It's like when we start off in life, we trade time for money.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.540]   Some people create more value in that amount of time, so they get compensated by the market.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.140]   And Jim Rohn, he's one of the OG personal development guys back in the day used to
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:56.700]   talk about this.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:03.820]   He goes, "A lot of people don't realize is that the market is a value-rewarding system.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.860]   Whether we like it or not, we live in a capitalist society.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.540]   And to the degree that you create value, you will be rewarded for that.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.700]   And it doesn't matter if you're a business owner or a team member or CEO."
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.180]   Because he even says like, "The highest paid CEO in the world makes $100 million a year."
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.820]   And that's Tim Cook at Apple.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.900]   Well, the reason why the board pays him that and he gets that and nobody blinks that is
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.140]   because he created a trillion dollars worth of value.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.660]   So my question to people when they say, "Well, I can't afford it."
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.020]   I want to ask them, "Well, how can you become more valuable?"
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.620]   Because if we can talk about how you become more valuable to your employer, to your team,
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:47.740]   to your community, then you start to ask yourself, "Well, now that I know what I can do to become
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.060]   more valuable, I need to find the time to do it."
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.380]   And that's where the time trading comes into play.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.900]   And that's what the best people in the world at is.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.660]   They're just good traders of time.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.540]   So you start off as time for money.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:05.900]   And you'll do that for a while until hopefully you're getting paid a lot more because you're
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.580]   becoming more valuable.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.420]   But then at some point, and this is...
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:14.300]   I think it doesn't matter if you're a business owner or not, you got to get good at trading
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.820]   money for time.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.260]   That's level 2.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.460]   And I talk about this in the book.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:24.060]   Level 3 is where I want everybody to eventually get is where you start trading money for money.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.420]   This is the investing side.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.260]   These are skill sets.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.060]   These are beliefs.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.940]   These are strategies.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.380]   You have to develop them.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.300]   But that is the path of life.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.700]   And nobody shared this with me my whole life until one day I realized it's like, "Oh yeah,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.420]   we start off...
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:37.980]   Everybody.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.580]   We start off trading time for money.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.140]   And then if we get smart and more valuable, then we trade money for time.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.260]   And then if that works out really well, we get good at that, then we have
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:53.660]   an excess or overcapacity of capital to then invest to have our money work for us.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.260]   And that's freedom.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.260]   And that's what people are after.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.740]   They're like, "Hey, I want to show up every day and I want to create an outcome so that
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.300]   one day, I don't have to work.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.980]   I can decide if I want to work."
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.260]   I get to is actually a real...
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.380]   It's not a mindset thing.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.220]   It's actually like a reality.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:17.100]   And that's where I think life gets really interesting when you wake up and you get to
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.860]   decide what you want to create on.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.220]   But it starts by just becoming more valuable so that you have the resources to be able
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.300]   to buy back more time to then become more valuable again to the market.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.820]   And then there's the "Nobody can do it better than me," Chris.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.260]   My rule is 80% done by somebody else is 100% freaking awesome.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.780]   And I just think we got to reduce our expectations.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.900]   I don't...
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.700]   My wife...
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:48.620]   We were talking about this yesterday because she's like, "You're so good at not worrying
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.420]   if the person gets it right the first time."
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.900]   And I go, "Well, I can tell you where that comes from.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.180]   Thousands of hours of being let down."
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:05.260]   And realizing that if I expect every person that I bring into my life to help me to know
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.380]   everything I know and do everything the way I think I'm going to do, I'm just going to
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.500]   live a life of being disappointed.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.940]   And instead, the way I look is I reframe it and I just say, "80% done by somebody else
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.860]   is 100% freaking awesome."
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.260]   If I have somebody else go to the grocery store for me and bring me my food to my house,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.700]   and yes, every once in a while, they got the wrong bananas or whatever, I didn't have to
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.260]   do it.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.820]   And I'm really grateful that I got to take that time to go work on something creative
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.860]   or spend time with people I love or whatever.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.820]   And it just changes the expectation.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:45.660]   And I think that's where when we start working on these beliefs, then it frees us up to actually
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.540]   invite other people to support us and use these tools to get more productive, to get
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.020]   more done.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.620]   But if you hold on to these beliefs, then you'll always hit a ceiling and you'll never
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.900]   actually free up your time.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.860]   I want to go briefly back to the money one because I know that it's the one that I struggled
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.420]   with the most.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.180]   And I'm guessing maybe there are some people out here that are feeling the same way, which
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.140]   is it's not that you necessarily don't have the money.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.060]   It's that it just feels you're responsible, maybe.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:23.020]   Or if I were to watch a movie, and then I'm like, "Well, I should pay someone to go do
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.500]   this thing.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.540]   But I had the time.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.420]   I just watched this movie."
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.420]   So how do you help people value their time?
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.980]   I always have them start simple.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:34.780]   And the truth is, they need to understand what their time is worth.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.020]   And the math equation is pretty straightforward.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.700]   It's whatever you get paid annually to do a job.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.380]   So you make, let's say, $100,000 a year.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.100]   It's simple math.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.420]   And then you divide it by $2,000.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:50.620]   That's the amount of value of your hour.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.820]   That works out to about $50.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:59.580]   My rule, and I call it the buyback rate, is if you can pay somebody else to do whatever
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:07.340]   you're doing for a quarter, like one fourth of that amount, $12.50 in that circumstance...
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.220]   Or sorry, if you're... Yeah, $50 is $12.50, then you should.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.660]   Right?
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:19.900]   And when you start using that filter in your personal life, from having people laundry
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:27.420]   service, to house cleaning, to Uber Eats, to a lot of stuff, you can start buying back
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.220]   that time.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.540]   Now, I also don't think you should buy back your time to hang out on a beach or watch
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.420]   Netflix.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.340]   I think you should ask yourself...
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.700]   Again, it's that time trade.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.340]   It's how do we become more valuable to the market?
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.860]   And I also agree, you should relax and enjoy yourself and recharge.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.780]   So I'm not saying you become a workaholic.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.420]   But it's if you constrain yourself to say, "Look, I'm only going to invest 40 hours a
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.140]   week in my career."
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.420]   So you block it and you create this constraint.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.300]   Then you go, "Okay, well, right now, if I do a time and energy audit on my calendar,
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:06.860]   I'm spending time on things that are taking my energy and very low cost to pay somebody
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.340]   else to do."
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.100]   And then you attack that list of those items.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.420]   And you just start trying to bring support.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.700]   And then the key is go do things that make you more money.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.780]   So it only fits into one of 2 things.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.300]   You're either doing more of the thing you know you're going to get paid more to do right
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:22.940]   now.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.260]   Right?
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.460]   So it's a lot easier, obviously, if you're in a role like sales or there's some performance
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.060]   component of the thing you do.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.580]   But you can negotiate that with your employer.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:39.180]   Like I have half my team on some level of performance compensation.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:44.460]   So they have a clear target that if they hit, they get financially rewarded for it because
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.740]   that means everybody wins.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.500]   And then do more of that.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.500]   Learn what that is or negotiate it with your employer.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.180]   And then free up your time.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.300]   And I'll give you a real example.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.340]   Like this guy, Wendell, who worked for me in sales.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.980]   I mean, he was making a half million...
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.340]   Like not half a million.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.980]   He was making about a quarter million a year, which is a lot.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.620]   And I get it.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:11.820]   But what he decided to do on his own time, because he started to see like, "Hey, I'm
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.700]   on calls for 30 hours a week on calls and then follow up and all that stuff."
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:22.140]   He was listening to me coach my clients because a lot of stuff we do is public inside of our
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.640]   company.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.340]   Not what our client shares, but me.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.860]   I record everything I do and just give it away to the team and put it on social media.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.660]   And he hired his own assistant to literally do all of his follow-up, do his prospecting,
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.460]   manage his calendar, manage his inbox, so that he could just do more calls because that's
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.900]   how he made more money.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.700]   So all of a sudden, he doubles his output.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.780]   Then he has a surplus.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.580]   He calls me out one day.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.940]   He's like, "I don't know what to do with all this money."
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.220]   I'm like, "Well, congratulations.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.140]   This is a very good problem to have.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.860]   Well done, sir."
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.420]   And I tell him to go into real estate.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.620]   He's like, "Well, how do I do that?"
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.780]   I go, "That's you to figure out."
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.980]   This is the thing is you free up your time to then fill it with learning new skills that
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.340]   are valuable.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.540]   So he went into real estate.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.660]   He hired a mentor.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.020]   This is what I teach people.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.460]   Go find somebody that's done it before.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.580]   Bring that person into your life.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.100]   And now what's crazy is he negotiated.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.980]   He only does sales Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, because on Friday, his assistant
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.500]   is queuing up all of the showings for him to go look at new real estate deals.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.460]   He's already bought...
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.980]   I think he's on his fifth building.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.260]   He owns like 20 some doors or whatever it's called.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.860]   And he's doing really well because he's thought through this math, right?
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.020]   And I know a lot of people are like, "Well, that's easy.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.140]   He's making $250,000 a year."
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.180]   It doesn't matter if you're making $50,000 a year or $100,000.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.740]   You got to learn how to free up your time to then invest it in things that your employer
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.220]   is going to value, or at least the market's going to value.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.900]   And then if you want to go chill out and watch Netflix, that's fine.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.420]   It's just...
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.740]   If you're during the day and during the day, you could do something to progress your career,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.740]   or you take an hour to drive to go get your food.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.060]   And instead, you could just have the food delivered to you.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.620]   So you could not have to take an hour to go do that.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.860]   That sounds like a great trade.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:16.140]   You just need to know ahead of time, when I'm buying back that time, I'm going to invest it.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:21.180]   I'm going to fill it with things that will compound and create more value in the future.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.860]   So there has to be trust.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.780]   You have to have sat down and thought about this and have a plan.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.060]   And you just keep working through it.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.140]   So I just tell people to allocate a budget, right?
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.980]   Chris, it could be very simple.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.180]   $500 a month.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:37.900]   Just take $500 and do the time and energy audit on your calendar and say,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.740]   "I'm just going to give myself permission to buy back maybe less.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.940]   Let's call it $100 a month.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.740]   I don't know what it is.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.220]   And then if I buy back that time, I'm going to do this with that time
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.260]   that I think over a period of time will be more valuable."
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.940]   It could be going to the gym.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.780]   Because I know for me, man, I show up way different if I worked out today
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.900]   than if I don't.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:03.340]   And that has a huge positive impact on the outcomes that I get to achieve.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:03.820]   Right?
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.660]   So that's just the way I think about it.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.140]   So let's talk about some of those things that you think people can get started buying back.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:15.500]   I think you gave some examples that I think are well known, like ordering your groceries online,
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.900]   or getting food delivered.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.540]   Great uses of trading dollars for time, I think, personally.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.820]   I do have some frustration with the grocery delivery thing,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:32.380]   because I felt like early on, there were so many misses and poor replacements that
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.820]   if you were like me and you were trying to plan a dinner out, you'd get the wrong thing.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:42.140]   Now, I find that Amazon's inventory management for Amazon Fresh, at least in the States,
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.020]   is so good that I don't have that fear anymore.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.940]   So that's a few.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.140]   What are some of your favorites?
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.580]   There's so many.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.020]   I mean, when I look at the early days of starting to do this...
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.380]   Laundry service.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.540]   I was crazy busy.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.260]   My fiance is pissed off at me.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.260]   I'm trying to get all my work done.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.060]   And this is what happens.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:10.380]   I literally had to get a laundry service so that I could work on Sundays in the morning.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.660]   Normally, I was done by 11am.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.300]   That was my rule.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.340]   And I got in trouble that day.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.540]   But obviously, just having somebody else take care of your laundry, like wash and fold,
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.340]   game changer.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.860]   I mean, just low-hanging fruit.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:26.140]   Having somebody come in, maybe once every 2 weeks, maybe once a week.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.980]   My world is a little different today.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:34.540]   But to come in to clean your house, to take care of the deep cleaning, that kind of stuff,
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.900]   that's a huge opportunity.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.700]   I mean, but even...
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.620]   Because some people are like, "I'm not going to pay somebody else 25 bucks an hour to do
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.500]   something I can do myself."
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:43.740]   All right.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:49.020]   Well, how about we just get better at getting our time back?
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.780]   How about you start using a calendar?
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.660]   That would be a big idea for people.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.660]   I know if we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.100]   I don't know who said it.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:07.420]   But I remember my wife's friend, she said that because she was just so frustrated with
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.980]   herself about the amount of wasted time running around her kids.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.580]   And I forgot this happened and that.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.540]   And it's like, people don't realize how much time is wasted in just the commute.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.180]   Right?
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.500]   So even just asking yourself like, "Are you driving to Costco?"
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.980]   "Yes."
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.420]   "Why don't you just order online?"
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.500]   "Well, I like to go to Costco."
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.700]   "I know you like to go to Costco.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.180]   But if you tell me you like to go there and you don't have enough time to go to the gym,
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.500]   then you're making a decision to go to Costco because you like it versus go to the gym,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.060]   which you know will have a compounding effect."
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:40.940]   Especially with the health.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.660]   I just want to say this.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.980]   When you're healthy, you have 1000 goals and dreams.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.500]   And when you're not, you have one.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.060]   And I bring that one up because if that's not front and center for a lot of people,
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   it should be the driving force behind everything we're talking about today.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.500]   Because it will have the biggest impact on your life, your mental health, your physical health,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.220]   worry your family will have for you.
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.700]   So it's like if you don't want your family to worry, that's all parents want.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.140]   They want to know you're happy and healthy.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.220]   So it's like, that's a big one.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.180]   Other things is...
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.740]   Again, when it comes to scheduling, it's everything from cutting down on meetings,
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.300]   saying no, inviting people to you.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.420]   That's a big one.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:19.660]   Right?
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:25.020]   So for example, I don't do the "Got a second" meetings, coffee meetings, etc.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.020]   Chris, and I'm sure you don't either.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.260]   Because I can buy myself coffee.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.420]   What I do instead is every Tuesday morning, I hike this mountain near my house.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.300]   And it's an open invite for anybody that wants to pick my brain or hang out with me
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.220]   to come and do the hike with me.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.020]   And I've been doing it now since I moved to this new city.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.980]   We live in Kelowna, BC for 2 years.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.900]   So every Tuesday morning, 6.30am, if you want to come hang out with me, anybody...
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.420]   And this is an open invite for your audience.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.300]   If they want to fly to Kelowna and pick my brain,
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.580]   I will be there.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.260]   And what's great is that now...
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.100]   I call it net time.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.220]   No extra time.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.980]   I compress all these other meetings into one experience.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   And usually, it's a 45-minute or it's a half-hour hike up and then 15 down.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.420]   It allows me to have great conversations.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.660]   It allows me to get my workout in.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.420]   So that's a big time-saving one.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.460]   Even considering using carpooling or public transit.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.260]   I'll tell you why.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.500]   Is a lot of people can do stuff if they're not driving.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.420]   So a lot of people don't understand that
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:34.220]   taking the public transit, the train...
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.980]   I know in San Francisco, I used to use a car service.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   I mean, Uber, actually, funny enough.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.340]   So Travis, who started Uber, was an investor in my company, Flowtown.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:49.740]   And when it came out, I was using it for next level stuff.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:54.220]   I remember Travis saying to me, he's like, "You're the only person..."
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:00.700]   I would send Ubers to go pick up my girlfriend at the time to bring her to the date to save me time.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.740]   Right?
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:08.540]   So I would use it as almost like a delivery system of people to bring them to me to save me time.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.500]   Now, that's an advanced thing.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.460]   People aren't going to be doing this.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.380]   But that's one for sure.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.060]   When you say that...
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.580]   Now they've built in the delivery function.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.540]   But I remember one time, little things like...
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.620]   I recorded an interview in person and the SD card didn't work.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.100]   And there's a data recovery company in San Francisco.
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:31.580]   And I was like, "Well, I'll just send the SD card to the company on an Uber instead of drive to the
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.620]   city and drive back."
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:37.020]   And using that for delivery, you used to have to convince the driver to do it.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.700]   You had to talk to him.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.740]   Now it's just part of the service.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.340]   "I left my laptop at this meeting."
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   And you're like, "Hey, do you think you could pick this up?
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.540]   I'll have someone bring it out."
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.700]   So yeah, I love that one.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:47.980]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.100]   I know you got a big list.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:49.740]   Let's...
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.380]   I use... My whole rule, if you had to put it into a list, it's "Go mobile."
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.460]   So I do not use services that don't have a mobile experience.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.780]   So... And this is for everything.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.940]   Home automation, security systems, lighting systems...
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.340]   Anything that my wife wants to buy that's like an electronic,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:16.940]   I ask if they have a mobile app because I want to be integrated into my workflow
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.580]   and just be able to access it wherever I'm at.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.780]   So that's a big one.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.060]   The other one is automation.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:29.260]   Anywhere that I'm doing the same thing over and over, I look for tools for automation.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.180]   I mean, we do that for lawn care.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.860]   We do it for locks, lights, obviously.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.500]   Cleaning cycles for things.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:44.060]   I mean, the amount of automation and just services.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.740]   Having somebody come to your house to clean your car, that's a real thing.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:57.420]   Or like my buddy, Brad, his wife was spending every Wednesday afternoon cleaning their cars.
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.100]   And I was like, "Hey, dude.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.900]   Why don't you guys have a cleaning lady?"
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.860]   She's like... He's like, "Yeah."
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.940]   I go, "Why don't you just ask the cleaning lady to clean the cars?"
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.740]   "Oh, geez. I don't know if we could do that."
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.680]   "Yeah."
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.060]   The woman who's cleaning your house obviously knows how to clean.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.940]   She drives a car.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.260]   Pretty sure she cleans her own car.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.660]   She probably wants more hours.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.700]   It's so funny when we just start thinking of things through that lens of like,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.340]   "How do we put things together? How do we..."
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.380]   And then the no touch side is the third principle.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.020]   The no touch is what we talked about.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.340]   Using online like Costco.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.020]   I don't go to grocery stores.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.460]   I don't buy stuff.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.060]   My whole rule is to the degree that I am not touching stuff,
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.220]   that's how I want the world to work.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.100]   So like my brother, there was a point in his career.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.780]   He's in the construction industry.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.180]   He's a home builder and whatnot.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:50:00.460]   He would probably spend 2 days a week, like 16 hours in his calendar,
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.260]   just bringing stuff around to people.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.020]   Okay.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.620]   And this is not complicated stuff.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.740]   It's just driving.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.380]   And eventually, I said, "You should hire a runner."
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.140]   So some people can't afford to do that.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.220]   I just want them to think about that.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.620]   It's like even if you...
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.740]   And it's a little work, Chris.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.700]   I could get somebody to do wash and fold, but I got to bring it to there.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.420]   Okay.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.620]   But that's that company.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:31.260]   There's actually another company that will come to your house and pick it up and do wash and fold.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.300]   Oh, I didn't even know that.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.580]   And it's an extra $6.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:39.100]   So is the $6 worth you saving 40 minutes there and back?
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.860]   Again, you do the buyback rate.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.340]   Yes.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:41.980]   Perfect.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.020]   Use a different service.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.540]   Some people are just not willing to ask.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.900]   I'm really...
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.940]   I'll even go as far as sometimes...
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.700]   Last year, I'll give you a real example.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.500]   Last year, Christmas time, I had my executive team in my hometown.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.260]   We went, we did an offsite.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   And I wanted to give them a gift.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   So I called the store that I wanted to buy all the stuff from.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.260]   And I said, "Look, I need 6 gift bags put together.
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.340]   But I need you to deliver it."
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.380]   And they're like, "Well, we don't do that."
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.660]   And I go, "I know you don't do that.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.180]   And I totally understand why.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.260]   But look, we're going to be at this restaurant.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:21.580]   The only way this is going to work is if you guys can put it together, bring it to the restaurant,
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.660]   have them put it behind the counter, and just put it on my name.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.020]   And then when I show up, it's there."
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:31.180]   And I share that, Chris, because some people just would not even ask to do that.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:34.300]   And I said, "Look, if you need to charge me an extra 10% or whatever, please do it.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.060]   But I knew the store they were... Their office,
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.340]   their location wasn't where the restaurant was, was walking distance.
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:45.180]   I mean, it takes 6 minutes to just take the bag, bring it over.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.820]   They get a multi-hundred dollar order.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:53.820]   And I look like I'm super thoughtful and kind because I got them this cool bag that
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.380]   had their names on them. It's just like...
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.620]   I just think a lot of people just don't even ask.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   They don't value their time enough to then ask people that have companies and would love
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.100]   more revenue to say like, "Hey, if you could do this and this, I'll pay you more.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.460]   You know what your buyback rate is."
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.860]   And a lot of them will just say, "Yes."
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.380]   It's like, "I actually drive by that neighborhood every day when I come to home.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.900]   So yeah, if you want me to drop it off..."
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.420]   We did this with meal prep.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:27.660]   I remember, probably 8 years ago, my wife was freaking out because we have
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.820]   2 young kids and I'm working.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.020]   I had a venture-backed company.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:34.540]   And I was just like, "You don't need to make dinner.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.100]   I love you.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.380]   And I know you want to make me food.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.100]   It's not going to change my life if you're not the one cooking."
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.780]   And the way we did it is I was at the farmer's market.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.100]   And there's this guy that we'd buy these frozen meals from.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.860]   And I was just like, "Hey, would you sell me during the week?
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.820]   Would you make these during the week and just drop them off at my house?"
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.940]   And he's like, "Well, we don't really do that."
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.300]   I go, "I know you don't really do that.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.500]   But maybe you could start and I could be your first customer.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.780]   Here's where I live."
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.900]   I've even done it... There was a meat guy I did the exact same thing with
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.300]   that I wanted him to deliver his meat.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.900]   Like you were saying, you're at a meat store earlier.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.620]   But he was like, "I don't really do that."
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.100]   And I said, "Well, what if you had 6 or 7 people
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.820]   that you were delivering on at the same time?"
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.620]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.580]   And I go, "Cool."
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.140]   I just called my neighbors up and said, "Hey, are you guys willing to commit
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:23.340]   to this level of purchasing from this meat guy?
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   You guys all know this store and you like it.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.340]   And if we do it, then he'll deliver it."
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.860]   And they were like, "Wow, you can get him to deliver?"
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.540]   I'm like, "Yeah, no problem."
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.380]   So, I'm just a very resourceful.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.140]   I ask.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.580]   I'm creative about how I find ways to get my time back.
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.220]   It's funny you bring up the meat store.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:47.900]   There's this amazing meat store in Millbrae, California near SFO called Pape Meat.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.660]   I learned this morning on the plaque on the wall.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.300]   It's the oldest business in Millbrae, I guess.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:59.980]   And we needed a particular type of meat, guanciale, which is the meat you use for carbonara,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.540]   which is what we're going to make for Christmas Eve dinner.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:09.820]   And if you go to their website, they do not discuss delivery on the website.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:14.860]   There's not an easy way to get the meat.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.900]   However, there's a website that I found.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.340]   This is all I had to do.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.420]   I searched "Deliver Pape Meat."
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:30.380]   And this other website, Towne.io, definitely some kind of startup, delivers for them.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.180]   Unfortunately, because it's Friday and I need it tomorrow,
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.100]   and it's the weekend and the holidays,
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.540]   that wasn't an option this day with my poor advanced planning.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.300]   But in general, I could have had it delivered.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.740]   Not because they did it.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.340]   And I'm sure if I called, they would have said, "Oh, no.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.700]   But this other website does it for us."
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.980]   So, even just this year, "Oh, I need to order this thing.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.420]   Let's just search to see if there is a service out there that delivers."
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.100]   So, I would just say, I now learned-
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.820]   It's a search.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.580]   Most people don't search.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.620]   Because their website doesn't say they deliver, doesn't mean they don't.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.220]   And obviously, for restaurants, there's plenty of apps that we all know about.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.540]   But there are alternatives like that.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:14.380]   We started using ButcherBox, which delivers actual meat and all kinds of stuff to your house.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.700]   So, we get fresh meat and talking about two different services.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.260]   "Sorry, Pape. We can't buy all my meat from you."
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.340]   No. And you're allowed to do that, right?
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.820]   You can use Instacart for certain things.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.180]   And you can use other services for the weekly reoccurring.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:35.180]   It's really just being open to spending the time to figure it out.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.460]   I remember my buddy Nick was frustrated because he just bought this thing off
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.620]   some online site.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.660]   This furniture showed up.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.980]   And then he's frustrated because he got it put together.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.260]   And he literally was like...
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.540]   I showed up just to say hi.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.500]   And I was like, "What are you doing?"
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.740]   Because this guy runs a successful business.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.020]   I'm putting together this furniture.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.460]   I'm like, "Why are you doing it?"
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:59.580]   He's like, "Oh man. I don't want to sit down and try to find the time to do the thing,
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.060]   to find the person, to hire them.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.260]   I might as well just do it myself."
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:08.220]   And I go, "Totally get it. In this circumstance, it makes sense.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:13.020]   But you need to consider the next time, the next time, the next time."
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.100]   So yes, the first time you do it, it's work to find a solution.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.220]   But it's not that time you're actually trying to buy back.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.620]   It's the dozens of times this year that if you find a handyman,
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.820]   or you use TaskRabbit, or use whatever service,
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.660]   you find a trusted resource that you can pay to come and do those types of work,
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.700]   that yeah, it's a little bit more work today.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:38.780]   But down the road, then all of a sudden, you have this list of resources
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.500]   where it becomes easier and you can even get it scheduled and part of your lifestyle.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.460]   And even the meal prep, I remember telling...
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:51.260]   Again, I have a house manager, so I know I live a privileged life.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.100]   But if it was me, I would have done the same thing.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:59.180]   I went and found a nutritionist that partnered with a meal prep company,
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.380]   so that they could take care of all of the food prep,
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.780]   so that I would hit 99% of my time.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.340]   I'm hitting my macros, I'm hitting my nutrients, I'm hitting what I need for my health.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.820]   So it's like some people look at that and they go like,
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.500]   "I can't believe you're paying $16 a meal."
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:22.700]   And I'm like, "You don't realize how much time I'm saving and the compliance."
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:25.260]   Right? This is the other thing is know thyself.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.860]   I don't want decision fatigue by deciding what I have to eat.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:33.420]   I want that taken care of for me so that I know I'm going to be healthy.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.860]   I know that the meal is made and it's going to hit all the macros
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.860]   that my trainer gave me and all these things.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:44.460]   And then that way, I can take that decision power or energy
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.620]   and give it to something that's actually required.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:49.180]   It's why you see people like Zuckerberg wear the same clothes,
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.380]   or Steve Jobs, or all these people.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.420]   The more you can take the decisions out of your life,
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.300]   then the more energy and time you're going to have to actually create and produce more.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.300]   And that's another big part that people don't consider when you use these services.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.380]   It's just you're freeing up your mental bandwidth.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.940]   Yeah. You talk about your house manager.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.220]   I'd love to understand just because it's a concept I don't think everyone knows.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.860]   First, what that person does.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:17.180]   And obviously, I know it's probably a luxury and a privilege to have that.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.620]   But I also want to talk about ways that some of what they do might be
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:25.900]   things that people could start to put into place with a virtual assistant or something like that.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.620]   And for context, I've thought for years about whether I ever
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.900]   was going to hire a virtual assistant.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:37.980]   I've been collecting tasks over the last few months that would have been great opportunities
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:43.500]   to outsource that any individual one was not big enough for me to say,
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.260]   "Oh, let's go hire a person so that..."
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.460]   For example, one was we were thinking of doing a gingerbread baking party,
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.620]   where we'd make a bunch of gingerbread cookies, have people over.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:58.540]   It's like, "Oh, it'd be really great if someone wants to find a recipe,
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.380]   figure out how to batch it for 30 people, go on Amazon Fresh,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.060]   order all the ingredients and have them delivered."
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.900]   It would probably not take that long, maybe half an hour.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:12.300]   I would probably take me even longer because I'm sure I would try to get caught up on what
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.380]   is the absolute best gingerbread recipe.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.660]   And the average person would probably not spend as much time as I would.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.580]   So it'd probably save me even more time.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.540]   But I wasn't going to go hire a virtual assistant for that one task.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.140]   But yeah, so maybe talk to me about the house manager and whether you
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.900]   think a virtual assistant could take on a lot of that and whether that's something
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.140]   regular people at the low cost you can get them now should be considering.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:40.940]   I'll start with the administrative assistant type of task because that's super approachable.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:45.500]   We live in a world where there are services out there.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:52.380]   If you search virtual assistant, task management, etc., where you can pay per task or by the hour,
[00:59:53.180 --> 01:00:02.300]   the $15 to $20 type range, or hire somebody in another part of the world for $4, $5, $6 an hour,
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:08.700]   I mean, it is absolutely approachable for every person out there in the world we live in because
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.940]   there's these companies that have built this technology.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:18.300]   The key though is to actually do the calendar audit to find out what are you doing with your
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.060]   time that is more administrative in nature, that is repeatable.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.380]   Because what I want to encourage people to consider is
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:30.620]   find the cadence of repeatable tasks that you can insert a person into your life,
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.580]   then they're available to do the things you just talked about, Chris.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:40.380]   Because if I have to think of finding another person to do a one-off thing, that feels heavy.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.380]   If I already have somebody in my life that's working 5 hours a week for me,
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:49.980]   managing research projects, or buying stuff online, or scheduling my travel,
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.340]   or taking information from this system and putting it in this system.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:59.500]   Every person that has a job probably does some type of work that isn't really rocket science,
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.180]   and you could just give to somebody else.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:06.620]   Sometimes it's just collecting data, it's putting stuff in a graph,
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.060]   it's post-production of social media stuff, or whatever it is.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.780]   Then you start with the reoccurring things or the person's part of your life,
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.660]   and then you can give them the one-off stuff.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.820]   The way I've always looked at it, and what I teach in my book is,
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:28.940]   I always start with the calendar first, because that's where I'm going to start buying back time.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.340]   And in the early days, it's usually task-based.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.580]   A lot of the stuff we talked about from lawn service to cleaning, wash and fold,
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.980]   meal prep, project management, it's all task-based.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.660]   And that's okay. You just start there.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.500]   And you might have 5 or 6 different people doing different types of tasks.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.700]   And then eventually you say, "You know what? I don't want somebody
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.380]   separate cleaning my car and cleaning my house. I'm just going to have one person do that."
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.820]   And you consolidate.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.660]   So if you think at the lowest level, every person listening to this,
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.100]   start with a budget, challenge yourself to buy back some time,
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.420]   and just know that you can have 2 or 3 people supporting you in different services or whatever.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.780]   And then what happens over time is you realize that there's
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:15.980]   a communication overhead, a management overhead of managing these things.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.820]   And that's what happened for us.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:25.980]   We had the house cleaner, we had the chef, we had the lawn care people,
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.220]   we had all these different people supporting our home.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.540]   And then when I looked at my calendar, because my wife and I both run companies,
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:38.140]   I realized there's a lot of work I was doing of just managing stuff.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:43.500]   I'm talking about going to the DMV and registering cars and calling my insurance company and
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.860]   maintenance on our homes and just transferring vehicles or literally everything.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.260]   Putting boats in storage. It sounds... Again, I understand how privileged of a life
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:00.700]   that I have, but these are things that were still on my plate to do.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:07.500]   So on Saturday morning, instead of going mountain biking with my friends or watching my...
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.660]   Deciding to say yes to putting our kids into soccer so that...
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:16.460]   I'm doing all this other stuff. And sometimes I just want to recharge.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:21.900]   I want to sit down. I want to read. I want to work on supporting our community.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.300]   My wife and I are very involved in the unhomed community in our city.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:32.700]   So it's like, I'd rather go do that than manage a spreadsheet of making sure that
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:37.820]   we have the right insurance on all of our assets. So we got to a place where we just
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:43.180]   decided to hire somebody that was the CEO of all of our personal stuff.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:47.100]   Now, again, this was after... I've had an executive assistant for a long time,
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:53.500]   for almost 10 years. But even at a certain point, because that person doesn't live in
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.980]   our home and is not in our home and not doing personal stuff, they're managing the business
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:03.340]   side of my life. Pass, purchasing, travels, all that stuff. Inbox, calendar.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:08.300]   Then we essentially rolled up all of the other stuff to one person.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:15.820]   And now we have one person. She's incredible. And we set up a rhythm where every Monday,
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.740]   I have lunch with her. We talk about the week. We talk about the tasks. We're eating together.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:25.740]   So it takes no time for me. Every Wednesday, my wife and I, my executive assistant and her,
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.820]   get on a Zoom call. We call it the house meeting. And we review. We have an agenda.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.620]   We review the projects. We review what they're working on. The playbooks. I mean, Chris,
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:41.980]   it's crazy. But I have an SOP. I have a playbook, handbook for the family, the Martell family.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.460]   What does that mean? Yeah. Walk me through what that looks like.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:54.700]   Who are our babysitters? It's all the names of the people that's like the kids, school principal,
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:05:00.860]   contact info, the vet contact. Think about all the contacts. So that's all in there.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:07.340]   All of our preferences, all in there. My size of my shoes, my favorite colors for a T-shirt.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:13.500]   It's crazy. Even just the preference file, where I like to sit on a plane, all these things.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.900]   Then I never have to make the decision again. So it's like, you ever register for an event
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.340]   and they ask you the same questions every time? It's like, I don't do that anymore. I just...
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.780]   My assistant or my house manager asks us once and then she writes it down.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:32.780]   So everything is in a Google document. I think we're moving everything to Notion right now. But
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:38.700]   everything... Even the... So we have a pretty cool sauna that does infrared and salt therapy and all
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:43.740]   these things. And it's got a procedure for how to schedule it to turn it on.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.580]   How to reconnect the red light system. And it's all in the playbook.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:56.460]   So that if I need to do it because it's a Sunday morning, I literally Google sauna and I find the
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:00.380]   playbook and I go to the section where it says "Reset the red light system" and I follow 7
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:07.180]   different steps to reset. It's all in there. All of our logins are all in one password.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:12.860]   And it's all under the house vault. So it's like, I'm in my backyard and I need to get into
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.780]   a door that's got a lock. And we change all of our locks to pins.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:22.860]   It's dynamic. Like an Airbnb. That way... Why? Mobile. Remember I said that. It's got to go
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:29.260]   mobile. So all the locks are all mobile-enabled. And all the pass... Or the numbers and the codes
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:35.660]   are all in one password. And it's literally... We've created this procedure for our life.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:39.900]   Again, Chris, I'm sharing this because I want to inspire people. I also know I may infuriate
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:46.700]   people. When you show people some of the super cars and a lifestyle and flying...
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.220]   All this stuff, they can either be inspired by it or they're going to be like "This guy's a douche."
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:56.460]   And I totally get it. I'm sharing this to hopefully inspire people that there are ways for
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:01.820]   you to incorporate this into your personal life that allow you to increase the quality of life
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.700]   you have. And most importantly, create jobs. A lot of my clients that struggle with this,
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:13.660]   that don't feel worthy of having somebody to that level of support, I just tell them it's like "Look,
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.500]   you can go buy..." Because this is what they're doing, Chris. They're going and buying the new
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:23.020]   Mercedes or the new BMW. I watch them do it all the time. My neighbors, I watch them do it.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:29.580]   The new car comes out, they went and bought it. Okay? Or you could stop complaining about not
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:34.300]   having enough time. And instead of buying the new version, just keep the current one for a
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:40.780]   couple years, hire somebody to manage your life, so that you have the time to recharge or go
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:45.180]   increase the value in the market to pay 3 times over the new car.
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:52.140]   It's so fascinating for me to watch, even in my world, friends of mine that struggle
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:56.620]   with their time and yet they don't understand where they're allocating their resources,
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:03.820]   their money. So yeah, pretty much, if it would show up on my wife or my to-do list,
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:10.700]   it is owned by our house manager, Betty. And we tell her all the time, "You're the CEO of our
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:17.500]   lives. We do not manage our things. You manage them. You create the playbooks. You take care
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.980]   of schedules and cadences and assets and relationships and all that stuff."
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.780]   And then we just create a reporting structure where we get the information we need on a weekly
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:32.540]   basis to keep us informed so we feel like nothing's getting dropped. So it's no different than you
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.620]   would for an executive assistant in your business life. You just do the same thing for your personal
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.940]   life. And it all evolved from having a bunch of individual things. So...
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.420]   You start small. Yes.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.620]   Yeah. I think that... It's funny. Two things came up. One, I've been pushing...
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.300]   There's a company called Trustworthy that I invested in, which is building the family
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.580]   operating system. And it started as the central repository of all the information about your life.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:02.460]   So like, "Here's our house. Here's our bank accounts." And if I were ever to pass away,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:08.700]   I have my sister and another person set to be able to access it. They know.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:13.420]   But now they've started adding things like, "For our house, here's our landscaping company." Or
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:19.500]   "Here's our internet service provider." So they're building a software alternative to
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.060]   Notion or Google Doc for this. And...
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.980]   I love it. Because most people don't know what information they should be collecting.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.420]   Right. Yeah. So their coolest thing is when you're on board, they're like, "All right.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:34.940]   Go put in your old tax returns. Go link your bank account. Here's your insurance policies."
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:39.660]   So Amy and I... Ann, for your benefit, they have a mobile app. So Amy and I know that if we're at
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:43.420]   the doctor's office and they're like, "Where's your kid's insurance card?" We know. "Open the
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   Trustworthy app. Here's the insurance card." We get pulled over. "Show me your proof of insurance.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.780]   Open the app. Here's our Geico card." We know where all of the things are.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.460]   Exactly. Think about how much time you're saved. Even the other day, we had our meeting on
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.980]   Wednesday this week. And one of the projects was get my wife's passport renewed. Do you know how
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:09.340]   many of my friends end up at the airport and their passport's expired and they can't go on a trip or
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.500]   miss a speaking gig? It's bananas. And why? Because they feel like, "I'm supposed to manage
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.460]   this. It's my life. I can even manage my life." It's like, when you actually give it to somebody
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.980]   else, and you say, "Please treat me like a child. I am okay with that." Because that's literally
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:31.820]   what I tell her. I'm like, "I want you to just assume that I'm not that intelligent. And I want
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:40.060]   you to track the stuff, everything. And you tell me when it's due or just do it. And we'll build
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.780]   a rhythm for communication reporting so that I know..." And then that way, it's all there, right?
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:51.100]   And all that stuff you said, the insurance, your wills, it's essentially like creating...
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.340]   In a high net worth individual, they'll usually have a family office.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:02.060]   You're creating the infrastructure for your own personal family office for your life that just...
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:09.580]   It just makes... Just even having a shared one password vault for your family's Wi-Fi logins and
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:15.980]   other online services is just a good idea. Yeah. I feel like you would absolutely love
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:20.860]   this product. I'm looking at it right now. And it says, "Renew driver's license." Because I
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.020]   already gave them my driver's license info. It says, "Trustworthy will alert you 120 days before
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:29.340]   your driver's license expires. Renew passport. Trustworthy will alert you 9 months before your
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:35.180]   passport expires." So by putting the information in, you get this reward of like, "Hey, passport's
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.420]   expiring in 9 months." I don't have to think about it anymore. I know that for all of our kids,
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.700]   I'm going to get an alert 9 months before any of those passports expire. And so I don't...
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.340]   It relieves the mental burden of me having to think about all these things.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:55.420]   But this is an example of... Because you're on the journey to try to find ways to buy back your time
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.060]   and you look at where you've had friction in the past and you found a service like this...
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.900]   So some people might hear about the house manager and go like, "That's crazy. I could never afford
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:10.060]   that." Think about there's tools out there. This company is literally built... Probably takes...
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:15.260]   It would be 30% of what she does. The software automates it. And I talked about that. It's like
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.660]   automation, automation, automation. I just feel like people need to really challenge themselves
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:25.660]   to value their time, to go on the journey to build it. It's like, "Yeah, it takes work."
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:29.980]   I'll actually give a real tactical thing for people if they're still on the edge and they
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:35.180]   haven't done it. This guy Jack Canfield, he wrote a ton of bestselling books, bestselling author.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:40.380]   Good dude. He talked about creating this thing called the frustration list because it's a muscle.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:47.580]   And his argument was most people don't even see frustrations in their world to see opportunities.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:52.620]   So it's a muscle you have to develop. And his argument was as you go through your day in your
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:59.180]   home, think about things that frustrate you. And just make the list. I'm not asking you to solve
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:05.980]   the problem. Just make a list. So it might be, "I'm downstairs working out and I don't have
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.620]   a cable to charge my phone." Literally, just write it down. "I don't have a cable to charge
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:16.700]   my phone." Or you get in your car and you realize you ran out of gum. And you like this certain type
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.020]   of gum and it's not there. Okay, write it down. Or it's like, you go to take... You get out of
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.740]   the shower and you don't have a hook for your towel after you dry off. It sounds crazy, Chris.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:36.940]   But I want people to do that for 2 or 3 days because 2 things. One, honor those frustrations
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:43.900]   and build a muscle and a routine of solving those problems. Make the list and actually wake up on
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.260]   Saturday morning and say, "Hey, I'm going to work through this list and just see if I can be
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.740]   creative about how I solve this stuff." Some of it could be simple like buy another truck.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.700]   And even that, it sounds so nuts, dude. People won't even give themselves permission
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:02.220]   to own 2 cable chargers for their iPhone. So there's one next to their bed and one in their
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:07.020]   office. Isn't it weird, Chris? They're like, "Yeah, no. I don't deserve that."
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:11.340]   If anyone listening feels they don't deserve it, I think I have like 20 extra iPhone chargers in
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.500]   my house. I will go ahead and send you one. Of course. Because you're like, "Hey, I want
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:20.380]   to have the things that I need and I'm willing to pay for extra stuff so that it doesn't become
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.940]   a point of contention." Because what's worse is if you're in... I do some backcountry skiing.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.180]   If I'm in trouble and my phone is dead because I didn't charge it when I should have charged it,
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:34.060]   that's a bad circumstance. So I just really want to encourage people to realize that if
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:39.820]   it doesn't feel natural to you right now to identify things in your life that you should be
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.700]   trying to buy back your time on, it's a muscle that can be developed by just writing down the
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.660]   things that are frustrating or not optimal. Some of you guys are like, "I love life. That's not
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.460]   a frustration." Look, just in a perfect world, wave a magic wand. If you could live a perfect
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.300]   life and you go through life and everything's awesome, how would it look? Make that list
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.860]   and try to create that. Okay. I think next year will be the year
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:07.100]   that I get started with trying to actually hire someone to help outsource a lot of these tasks.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:10.220]   Now, I'm going to probably... I need to hire a virtual assistant to help me go
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.100]   research the best virtual assistant services. So I'm not ready for someone full-time yet. But
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.580]   there are a few things that as I've listened to you talk, and as I've done my homework and
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:24.780]   just known you, that you've done that I think maybe don't fall exactly perfectly into buying
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:28.780]   back your time and the conversation we just had, but I think are worth running through because I
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:35.180]   think people find a lot of value out of them. One is on designing your perfect week. One is on
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.660]   thinking about the 7 Pillars of Life. And let's start there and then I'll get to the rest.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:47.260]   Cool. The 7... The perfect week. And I actually have a diagram in my book that I put in there
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:52.060]   because I wanted people to actually see what that looks like for me. So there's... I think
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:16:02.620]   it's on page 141. It's literally the diagram. What's important is to design all the big rocks
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.180]   into your life so that you actually understand that you do have the capacity.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.820]   A lot of people go like, "I don't have the time." That's cool. Let's talk about that.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.820]   But let's just start by saying, "Okay, here's a 7-day template I give people."
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.860]   They buy the book, they go to the website and I give them the template.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.980]   And then they make a list of all the important things in their life. Like spending time with
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:29.100]   their kids, going to the gym, their work, their creative stuff, their hobbies, or whatever.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:35.500]   And then you take that and you put it into the calendar and you block them in. The big stuff.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.460]   It's like, "Go to the gym every day. What time do you want to go? It's an hour or 90 minutes.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:43.420]   Put it in there." And what I think people realize if they go through the exercise
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.300]   is there is actually enough time in a week to do everything you want to do.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:55.820]   You just have to now then honor the calendar. And the reason why I encourage all of my coaching
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:01.580]   clients to do this is because when... If you have the rhythm of your week designed,
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.980]   then when you hire somebody like a virtual assistant to support you,
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.580]   they know where certain things go so they don't have to bug you.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.420]   It actually is not efficient, Chris, if you have somebody that's managing your
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.220]   inbox and your calendar and helping you with scheduling meetings and stuff,
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.620]   to have to ask you every time, "Hey, are you okay doing a meeting at 3 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon?"
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:26.940]   Versus, "Hey, these are the 2-hour windows each day that I do meetings. So if a meeting comes in,
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.020]   just put it there." Now I take that another... I'll just give you an advanced tip on that for
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:38.220]   a virtual assistant. We do 3 levels of priority. So I'll sometimes do a P1, P2, P3 in the email
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:45.980]   reply. A P1 means cancel something to make it happen, a priority level. P2 is make it fit as
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   soon as possible, but don't cancel anything. P3 is within the next 2 weeks. And P4 is don't rush
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:18:00.380]   if it happens cool, if it doesn't, no harm, no foul. And then... So even just trying to create
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.540]   these systems and language around how you work with somebody to manage your calendar
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:10.060]   is important, but it all starts with designing the perfect week. Does that make sense?
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:15.900]   Yeah. I was just actually thinking about some way that you could secretly encode that
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.060]   into your email. So you reply to someone and there's some...
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:24.780]   Here's how I do it. I leave an email draft and I write it in the draft so she sees it
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.540]   because she's in my inbox. Ah, yeah. If someone's in your inbox.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:33.340]   But I was just... All my head could think about was like, "Oh, what if I had this secret code where
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.540]   I had a signature? And if I end it with an exclamation point?"
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.380]   Looking forward to hanging out... You could just do signature,
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.980]   enter, enter, enter, and put it right at the bottom and nobody even sees it or different.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:51.020]   I think you're onto the same pattern of the language. So it's like, "Can't wait to meet"
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:56.300]   means this. "Looking forward to talking soon" means... You know what I mean? You can add that
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:00.300]   as a language signature. It was superhuman. They have these snippets. So that snippet could be
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:05.580]   called P1. I know that I just write P1 and then it posts this line that means...
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:08.780]   Boom. So the 7 Pillars of Life.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:15.740]   7 Pillars of Life is a way that I create a feedback loop for myself on how I'm showing up
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:22.860]   in my life and at least creating a point of reflection to improve it. And the reason why
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:29.260]   I designed this is a long time ago, a lot of my friends... I went through a challenging
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:34.620]   time with my fiance and that didn't work out. But then I got married. And I don't know about you,
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:39.100]   but it seems like people get divorced. And it's crazy. And you're just like,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.140]   "Why do they get divorced? Why are they having challenges in their lives?"
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:49.420]   And typically, it's because there's a fracture. And then the fracture lasts for weeks and then
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:53.980]   months and then eventually a year. And the fracture ends up creating such a wide divide
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:20:00.460]   that they can't repair it. So what I've done is across these 7 core pillars... It's actually a
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:05.340]   bonus chapter. I wasn't even going to include it in the book. And my editor was like, "Hey,
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:11.900]   I really think the 7 Pillars would be a great tool for everybody to just wrap it all up."
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:17.820]   And every Friday morning, I sit down for 30 minutes. And it doesn't even take me 30 minutes.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:23.420]   It takes me like 5 or 6. But I rate myself out of 10 on these 7 Pillars. This is a spreadsheet.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:31.740]   I've been doing it for years. And the 7 categories are Health, Hobbies, Spirituality, Friends,
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:41.180]   Love, Finance, and Mission. And I do those ones because they encompass how I want to show up in
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:44.860]   the world. Spirituality is important. It doesn't matter if you believe in God or whatever God or
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:51.420]   the universal consciousness or spirit or energy, whatever it is. Just asking yourself, "Do you have
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:56.380]   a relationship? Are you spiritual? Are you meditating?" Whatever it is. And just giving
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:01.180]   yourself a rating on those things. Finances, right? A lot of people, they don't want to talk
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.860]   about money. They don't pay attention to their money. And then they wonder why they have none.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:10.460]   Right? Or hobbies. People are like, "Oh, hobbies must be nice." It's like, "Look,
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:15.260]   all I know is that after I go snowboarding with my buddies, I'm a better dad. I'm a better husband.
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:20.940]   I recharge. I connect. I want to do those things." So what happens is I score myself on those 7
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:27.660]   pillars. And then this... I'll actually give you this like today's. That's always better real time.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:33.740]   So today, I scored myself pretty high. I'm having a good time right now. My 2 lowest scores. One was
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:38.620]   Friends and the other one was Hobby. So here's the bonus one of this. I got an 8 and a 7.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.580]   I always write in the spreadsheet a note on how to fix it. So the Hobby one is book
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:50.780]   snowbiking. So I do this crazy thing called snowbiking. And then the Friends one is low,
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:55.660]   but the good news is I go snowbiking with my friends. So I'm going to get a double whammy.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.700]   And all I did the action... That's why I give myself 30 minutes to do this.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.580]   I just made a list of all the dates that I'm free to go snowbiking. And then I sent a text message
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:07.260]   to my 5 friends that I go snowbiking with and says, "Hey guys, can we just schedule
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:12.060]   one of these days to go snowbiking?" And then I've accomplished it. Literally,
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.380]   it's that simple. It's just every week, I assess myself on those 7 dimensions.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:21.580]   I take my 2 lowest scores. If it's love, because I haven't been there for my wife, it might be...
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.380]   Then I set a commitment to take action in the next 7 days. And that one might be like schedule a date
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:31.820]   night, give my wife night off on Monday, let her take a bath, whatever it is. And because I do that,
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:36.940]   Chris, I just feel like I get to live a higher quality of life because I'm not trying to fix
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.860]   things because there's a fracture that's been going on way too long around not seeing my
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.420]   friends or not taking care of my health or not focusing on my mission or whatever it is.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:50.620]   And it's been a big part of my life. I love it. And on the topic of relationships,
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:57.500]   the last thing I wanted to chat about, you hired a coach to live with you and help the family and
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:02.940]   build deeper relationships. For those of us who aren't going to do that right away or it's not in
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:07.020]   the budget, what lessons did you take away that maybe we could steal from you?
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:12.540]   So many. Her name is Brooke. She is an angel. We've been working with her for 3 years.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:18.620]   I'm just a big fan of hiring people to increase the caliber of our life in different areas from
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:26.780]   fitness to business to our family. And we got to the point where Brooke and I... It's fun because
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:31.180]   she'll have private calls with my wife and she'll have private calls with me and then we'll do a
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:37.740]   group call. But it got to a place where I was like, "I think there's another level of opportunity,
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.100]   but I think you'd have to see us instead of hear us." Because you think about it, Chris,
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:51.180]   explaining to somebody what happened is you recounting the situation. It was always their
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:56.140]   version, your version, and then the truth. Versus them being in the room, seeing it,
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:04.380]   and then they get to get their interpretation. So I literally offered to fly her up. She lived
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:09.340]   in California and she came and lived with us for 3 days. She slept in our house, lived in our home,
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:15.500]   woke up in the morning, watched the morning routine. So it was really fun to have her get
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:21.580]   a new level of insight into what all the conversations we were having meant in a
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:27.580]   real-world scenario. The things that I learned personally was she did some incredible work with
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:33.900]   my wife around reconnecting with her feminine. And you'd have to ask my wife about the impact
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:38.380]   it had on her, but I got to see it. She did some dancing. She invited me. She's like,
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.260]   "Do you want to do it with us?" And I'm like, "I'm here to play Fallout."
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:47.100]   So 7am, instead of going to the gym, I sat down and I danced with my wife and Brooke. And
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:56.060]   it was pretty crazy, man. Just understanding how women's physiology and their feminine side of
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:25:02.220]   their connection is just part of it. It's crazy. It's not what men do. Men scream and charge off
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.860]   into war. And again, it's masculine versus feminine. It's not even a gender thing.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:14.380]   But that was a big takeaway. She worked with our kids. So she did some exercises with our kids to
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.180]   understand the way they were building their worldview and what was important to them.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:23.980]   So she made them draw a picture of their family. You see this in therapy sometimes.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   But then we had some issues, dude. It was really cool. My oldest son had a meltdown.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:36.700]   So she got to see how we responded to it and then gave us some cues. She explained to my wife that
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:42.300]   these things are 100% normal. So it allowed her to feel less guilty about those things happening.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.580]   I think if you don't have an external perspective, you sometimes think like,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:48.620]   "This is the end of the world. And I'm such a bad parent because this is happening."
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.620]   It's like having an expert come in and say, "Oh, actually, it's super normal.
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:57.500]   You handled that really well. Here's why. And in the future, if you want a little bit of coaching,
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:08.060]   do this." For me personally, it sounds crazy. I learned that my wife likes to tell me about her
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.860]   day, not because I'm going to have a test at the end of it so I have to remember everything,
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:17.260]   but just because it's her way of decompressing at the end of the day.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:25.500]   So this was a huge win for me because I now prompt it. Where before I was scared of it because I was
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.940]   like, "Oh my gosh, she's going to sit there and talk for 20 minutes and I don't know.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.340]   Am I supposed to help? Am I not supposed to help? Why is she telling me all this stuff?"
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.180]   And now I go, "Hey, babes, tell me about your day." This is literally the last thing we do
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:43.340]   every night because Brooke explained to me what was happening and that I'm not going to be tested
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:47.660]   and I'm not supposed to do anything other than listen. So I will tell you,
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:53.580]   it might sound simple for some of you men out there, you will be the best husband in the world
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:59.500]   if you say, "Hey, babes, tell me about your day." "Wow, that sounds tough. Tell me more."
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:04.940]   Literally that language. "Tell me more." Game changer. So that was big.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:15.260]   And then just really like how to show up for your partner. Some physical things. A lot of women,
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.620]   they want to feel safe. They want to feel seen. They want to feel appreciated. So that was a big
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:27.580]   thing. Men don't want to... This one that I think my wife really took away is men hate to be
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:33.420]   criticized. I don't know if you've ever had your wife criticize you, or do it in front of another
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:38.780]   person. There's certain things that are just like, for whatever reason, is really challenging.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:44.620]   So once she saw it and got some cues on it, it just changed the way we show up
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:48.780]   in public. We worked on this. There's a book. I can't remember the name of it.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.820]   This is another big one. And I'll leave on this one is
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:58.060]   "Launchings and Landings." So she taught us the value of a launching and land. I'm so driven by
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:04.380]   time, as you guys can all hopefully pick up, that I'll just run out the door. It's like I'm leaving,
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:09.180]   going to the gym. I just ran out the door. She said the 2 most important things you have to
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:14.540]   get better at as a couple is launchings and landings. Meaning that when you leave, it is
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:20.220]   a deliberate go find the partner. "Hey, I'm leaving now. I'm going to do this. I will see when I get
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:27.100]   back." And then when you land, it's "I'm back. Here's what I did. Do you need me for anything?"
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:32.460]   And it might sound crazy, but that... We actually taught it to our kids. So even before I come into
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:37.900]   my office in the morning, because I have a home office, I go and I do a launch with my kids where
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.100]   I give them little kisses and I tell them about them and say, "I'm going to my office now."
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:46.220]   And we call it a launch. And then when I get back or at the end of the day, if I'm done early,
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:50.700]   I go find them and I'm like... I land with them. I'm like, "Hey, I'm done." And they're like...
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:55.820]   And they actually say, "I'm launching too." And they'll tell us about them going to do stuff. So
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:02.140]   I just think it's those little tweaks. In life, it's never about these big moves. It's these one
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:08.780]   degree, these two degree changes. And then when you follow that trend line over 5, 10, 25 years,
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:11.740]   they have these huge pieces of impact on your life.
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:18.700]   Yeah. So two things I took away. No Irish exits in the house. It's for parties only.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:25.180]   But also, I've just learned to get better about communicating. I think sometimes there's a person
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:30.620]   in a relationship that takes the mental burden of everything that has to happen. And if you don't
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:35.100]   communicate that you're doing something, they feel like it's their responsibility to do it.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:40.780]   So for me, if I don't say, "Hey, I am still planning on doing X," my wife might assume,
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:44.540]   "Oh, maybe you're not going to do it." So... Emotional shrapnel saved.
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:50.540]   We went through a lot. We're way over time. I got an advance copy of the book. So I've already
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:56.220]   read it, even though by the time anyone listening is listening, it will be out. I highly recommend...
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.220]   I feel like you've got three on your bookshelf. I was like, "I'm going to maybe have a bookshelf
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:04.940]   in this new studio. Now I need to go get a physical copy." I only read the digital copy.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:11.260]   But definitely tell everyone where they can find it, who it's for and everything,
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:16.860]   and where they can find you. Yeah. The book is designed for people that obviously want to become
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:21.340]   a better time trader. It's called Buy Back Your Time. Buybackyourtime.com. It's available on
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:26.540]   Amazon. If anything I shared today serves you and you end up getting the book or whatnot, I would
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:32.380]   love, love, love a review on Amazon. I'm working with my team to create a movement around
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:38.620]   business and executive level performance and just really help people understand how to
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:42.860]   build a life they don't grow to hate. That's my biggest thing, Chris.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:49.660]   I just don't want people to go after this achievement lifestyle or this success ladder
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:53.980]   to just find it leaning against the wrong wall because they just don't know how to think about
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   the energy and the time and just getting more of their life. So that's why I created it.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:07.020]   It's been two and a half years of love and sweat and frustrations and just putting everything into
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.460]   it. And yeah, I'm really proud of the book. And the hardcover is cool. And I'll tell you why,
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.780]   Chris. If you get a copy, you should get the physical copy. I actually got my signature.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:21.340]   That's my signature inside. So take the jacket cover off. I designed the whole...
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:26.700]   People never see this stuff, but I cared about it. And I'm really proud of it. But yeah,
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.860]   buybackyourtime.com. Awesome. And what about you? Where can people find you on the internet?
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:39.100]   I am on all social media channels, Dan Martell, 2LzMartell.com, my website, TikTok, Instagram,
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:43.340]   Facebook, Twitter, you name it. I'm there. I put out content every day.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.500]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.780]   Dude, so fun reconnecting, man. Seeing you again. I appreciate the opportunity.
