[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Let me make the claim that, in fact, we're probably in even a better situation than we are with evolution because when we're designing these systems, we're doing it in a sort of deliberate, incremental, and in some sense a little bit transparent way.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   No, no, no. Not yet. Not now. Nobody's being careful and deliberate now. But maybe at some point in the indefinite future, people will be careful and deliberate. Sure. Let's grant that premise. Keep going.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Okay. It would be like a weak god who is just slightly omniscient, being able to strike down any guy he sees pulling out, right? If that was the situation. Oh, and then there's another benefit, which is that humans were evolved in an ancestral environment in which power seeking was highly valuable, if you're in some sort of tribe or something.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Sure. Lots of instrumental values made our way into our- But even more so than the current loss matrix. Had strange warped versions of them make their way into our intrinsic motivations.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Yeah, yeah. Even more so than the current loss matrix.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Really?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   The RLHF stuff, you don't think that there's nothing to be gained from manipulating humans into giving you a thumbs up?
