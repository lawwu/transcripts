[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660]   Andrea, a podcast listener in Jackson, Mississippi,
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.020]   writes in, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.160]   "Thank you for your books,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.800]   "and particularly your new book on Providence," she writes.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.080]   "It has proven to be life-altering for me.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.100]   "Thank you.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.320]   "I was wondering if you could take a moment
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.400]   "to address an entirely different topic,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.420]   "a marriage question, actually.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.660]   "I've started to notice an emerging view
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.360]   "of complementarity online and in my own circles
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.640]   "that seems a little off to me.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.680]   "It's called complementarity and holds to the idea
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.180]   "that the husband and wife should take on
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.400]   "different roles in the home,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.560]   "roles that mostly don't overlap.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.060]   "But to me, it often sounds like simply a functional idea.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.880]   "So if the wife is a better teacher,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.820]   "she teaches the children the Bible,
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.060]   "and the husband doesn't.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.700]   "Or if the wife makes more money,
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.760]   "the husband takes the primary role
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.980]   "in caring for the daily needs of the kids.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.020]   "It's called complementarity in the sense
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.360]   "that each spouse is not duplicating the role of the other.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.840]   "Each complements what the other is doing.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.340]   "But I don't know what else to call it
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.120]   "except to say it feels like a genderless complementarity.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   "The husband and wife do not overlap duties
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.300]   "out of efficiency, not from deeper convictions.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.000]   "In fact, gender rarely, if ever,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880]   "is brought in to define which roles the man has
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.460]   "that the woman does not and vice versa.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.360]   "Do you see this functional complementarity?
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.080]   "If so, how do you respond
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.020]   "and what roles in the home are most gendered?
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.140]   "I would love your thoughts on this."
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.100]   - I suppose it's inevitable that the longer a label
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.100]   is used like complementarianism or complementarity,
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.600]   the easier it is for the label to replace the reality.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.480]   The label complementarian as a designation
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.580]   for how men and women relate to each other
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.220]   has been around for about 35 years.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I would want to stress that labels are only valuable
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   if they capture and communicate reality.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   So it's the biblical reality that we really care about,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.200]   not so much the label.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   Now, I think Andrea is right
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.520]   that the label today is less clear and less precise
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   in the reality it refers to than it used to be.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.660]   And she's pointing to a particular use of the label
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.700]   where the reality behind it
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540]   seems to have more or less vanished.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.700]   People are calling themselves complementarian
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.820]   without any serious reference
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   to what the essence of manhood and womanhood really are
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.660]   and what that essence calls for in life.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.180]   From the beginning in the late '80s, 1980s,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.860]   the term complementarianism included
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160]   not just the biblical conviction
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.960]   that men should be the elders or pastors of churches
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.780]   and men should be the heads of their marriages or homes,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.620]   but also the conviction
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.340]   that underneath these distinctions in roles,
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.900]   there are profound differences
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.740]   in the very nature of manhood and womanhood.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.180]   And those differences in the unique essence of manhood
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.620]   and the unique essence of womanhood
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.900]   were designed by God in creation
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.500]   and were the foundation
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.340]   for why God assigned the differing roles that he did.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.620]   What we are by God's original design
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.820]   in making us male and female
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820]   has always been the foundation for God's design
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.140]   for how men and women relate to each other
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.980]   and what roles we take.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.980]   So I would say it's a fundamental mistake
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.300]   for husbands and wives or men and women in the church
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.460]   or men and women in general
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.460]   to define our roles and how we function in them
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.020]   without any reference to the deeper design of God
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.620]   and who we are as male and female.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.620]   So let me try to show what I mean
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.380]   by referring to a couple of Bible passages.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.380]   For example, 1 Timothy 2, 12 to 14.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.300]   I do not permit a woman to teach
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.220]   or to exercise authority over a man.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.060]   Rather, she is to remain quiet.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.060]   And then he gives a foundation, an argument, a ground
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.140]   that goes all the way back to creation
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.100]   and the ruin of that creation in the fall.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.140]   He says, verse 13,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.140]   for Adam was formed first, then Eve,
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.180]   and Adam was not deceived,
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.820]   but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.820]   So I take Paul to be arguing something like this.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.320]   The authoritative teaching role in the church,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   that is the role of governance and teaching,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.860]   the role of an elder,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.860]   is to be filled by spiritually mature and gifted men
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.440]   because God established in the first two chapters
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.300]   of Genesis a peculiar responsibility
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.300]   and leadership for Adam as part of God's design for manhood
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.780]   and what it means to be male in his family and in the world.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.520]   Now we can see this design
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   for man's peculiar responsibility in leadership confirmed
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.920]   by the way it falls apart in the moment of Satan's temptation
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   and the way God follows up with Adam and Eve after the fall.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.400]   Genesis 3, 6 says that Adam was with Eve at the temptation.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.560]   He didn't show up later,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.920]   but Satan being subtle and deceptive,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.200]   totally ignores the person, the man,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   that God had made responsible for the life of the garden.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   The man.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   Thus Satan attacks at this very crucial moment.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.120]   He attacks and undermines God's design
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   and turns the woman into the spokesman and the leader
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.460]   and the decision maker for humanity.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.160]   Now both Adam and Eve fall for this.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.080]   Adam remains totally silent when he should have stepped in
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.440]   and taken responsibility
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.160]   for this horrifically dangerous moment.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.200]   Eve willingly assumes the role of responsible leader
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.780]   and the result is catastrophic.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.200]   Failure to be obedient to God for both of them.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.040]   Now when Paul says in 1 Timothy 2, 13,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.760]   Adam was not deceived,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.520]   but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.900]   I don't think he intends to say Adam is guiltless.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.080]   We know that from Romans 5,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.520]   where Adam's disobedience in fact
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.080]   is the decisive disobedience
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.880]   that brings down the curse on humanity.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.420]   The point rather of saying Adam was not deceived
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.060]   is that Satan undermined Adam's leadership role
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.820]   by not targeting Adam for deception,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.400]   but rather the woman.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.680]   He made her the leader at the moment of deception.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.520]   So the point in the context of 1 Timothy is this,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   when the role of men and women are reversed
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.960]   at the very point where leadership matters most,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   things go very badly for families and churches and societies.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.040]   Now God confirms that understanding of what happened
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   by the way he calls the couple to account.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   A few verses later,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.940]   God comes to find them in the garden.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.320]   Genesis 3, 9 says,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.860]   "The Lord God called to the man and said to him,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.760]   "Where are you?"
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.320]   "I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself."
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.880]   And he said, "Who told you you were naked?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.180]   "Have you eaten of the tree
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.020]   "which I commanded you not to eat?"
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.020]   Now why didn't God seek out the woman first
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.020]   since she ate the forbidden fruit first?
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.980]   Because God made man first
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.120]   and built into him a God-given sense
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.340]   of sacrificial responsibility for leadership
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.020]   and protection and provision.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.720]   He is responsible for what just happened.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.460]   That's the price of leadership,
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.460]   this kind of built-in creation-based leadership for man
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.020]   is confirmed in Genesis 5.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.620]   This is the second text I'm looking at.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.140]   Ephesians 5, 23 to 30,
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.800]   "The husband is the head of the wife,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.720]   "even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.780]   "his body, and is himself its savior."
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.100]   Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.260]   so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.380]   Husbands, love your wives.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.380]   Yes, Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.740]   He who loves his wife loves himself,
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.720]   for no one ever hated his own flesh,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.060]   but nourishes and cherishes it
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.780]   just as Christ does the church.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.780]   So Paul describes the relationship as irreversible.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.300]   The roles are not interchangeable.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   Christ and the church don't get interchanged.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.880]   They are the meaning of this relationship.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.060]   How the husband and wife relate
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.980]   is to show the covenant love between Christ and the church,
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.740]   and Christ is the leader,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.780]   savior, protector, nourisher, provider.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.860]   And Paul roots those roles
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.420]   in the original pre-fall creation account in Genesis 2, 24,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.780]   which he quotes now in verse 31.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.540]   "A man shall leave his father and mother
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.780]   "and hold fast to his wife,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.180]   "and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.300]   And then he applies it like this.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.880]   This mystery is profound, and I am saying,
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.800]   it, that is the meaning of manhood and womanhood in marriage,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.460]   it refers to Christ and the church.
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.880]   That's the meaning of male and female in marriage.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.740]   Male and female modeling Christ and the church
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.020]   in roles of headship and submission
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.780]   that cannot be reversed any more
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.900]   than Christ and the church can.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.020]   So I conclude from these two texts,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.300]   1 Timothy 2 and Ephesians 5 and others
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.060]   that I'm not mentioning,
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.060]   that the very nature of God-designed manhood and womanhood
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:35.700]   is the foundation of the roles we are given by God.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.100]   A complementarianism stripped of its foundation
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.980]   in the God-given essence of manhood and womanhood
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.340]   is a label that has lost its reality.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.260]   When it comes to the hundreds of activities in the home,
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.300]   and who does them, that will be sorted out best
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.140]   where husband and wife agree biblically
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.060]   that the man bears a special God-given burden
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.500]   of responsibility for leadership, for protection,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.420]   for provision in the family,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.420]   all carried out in the pursuit of the amazing model
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.820]   of Christ's love for the church
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.420]   and the church's glad submission to Christ.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.740]   - Thank you, Pastor John and Andrea.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.700]   Thank you for the question.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.420]   You can ask a question of your own.

[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.260]   Well, how do we shepherd small children
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.620]   through the pains of life,
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.140]   particularly when it comes to God's providence
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.820]   over all things, even our trials?
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.420]   When is a child ready to try and understand these things?
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.420]   And how early is too early?
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.540]   These are tricky questions,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.340]   important ones for all parents to think through,
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.740]   and that's how we begin next week.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.920]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.840]   Have a great weekend.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.740]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.900]   (upbeat music)
