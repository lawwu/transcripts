[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.800]   My guest today is Dr. Bernardo Huberman.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.880]   Dr. Bernardo Huberman is the Vice President
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.320]   of NextGen Systems at Cable Labs.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.820]   Prior to that, he was the Director
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.640]   of the Social Computing Laboratory at Hewlett-Packard.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880]   And he is, as his name suggests, my father.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.040]   Today, we discuss various topics in science,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   including relativity theory,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.200]   chaos theory, and quantum computing.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.640]   But I'd like to assure you that even if you have
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.780]   zero background in physics, computer science,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.920]   or mathematics, that entire discussion will be clear to you
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   as to what those things are,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.960]   and even some of how they work.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.840]   During today's discussion,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.760]   we also talk about a life of science,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.400]   that is, what it is to spend one's life in curiosity,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.440]   in trying to understand the universe around us,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.520]   and how to understand ourselves.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.940]   Indeed, today, we also talk about neuroscience,
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.840]   how the brain works, and the different sorts of questions
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840]   that I do believe everybody asks,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760]   whether you're a scientist or not.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.120]   Questions like, where do we come from?
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.480]   Is there a God?
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.440]   What is our use or purpose in the universe?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.080]   And how is it that we can ponder these super high-level,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.760]   abstract questions about how we got here,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.040]   and what our purpose is,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   and how things work at the quantum level,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   tiny, tiny bits of things that we can't even see.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.400]   And at the same time, to lead an everyday life
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.560]   that is meaningful and joyful.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.160]   We talk about this in the context of understanding oneself,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.960]   in relation to others, family, community,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.440]   including scientific community,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.720]   and what it is like to come from a different country.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760]   My father immigrated from South America.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.720]   What it was like to do science in the United States
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.360]   then and now, cultural differences.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880]   And of course, we touch on some of our relationship as well.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.980]   How could we not?
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.980]   I must say, for me, it was an immense pleasure
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.880]   and privilege to have this conversation,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.180]   not just because Dr. Huberman is my father,
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.600]   but because I believe the knowledge,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   and indeed some of the wisdom that he shares,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.240]   will be useful to everybody.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   About what it is to carve one's own unique trajectory,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   in terms of career and life.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   And at the same time, how to savor the simple,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.080]   everyday things that make life so worth living.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.580]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.720]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.360]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   and science-related tools, to the general public.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.340]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.040]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.020]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.640]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.240]   Now, I've spoken many times before,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960]   on this and other podcasts,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.880]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   Now, the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.160]   in the quality of sleep that you get each night.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.320]   How soft that mattress is, or how firm it is,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.840]   how breathable it is, all play into your comfort
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.480]   and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.880]   So if you go to the Helix website,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.720]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.680]   that asks you questions such as,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.860]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.600]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.620]   Things of that sort.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.240]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   maybe you don't.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.920]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.760]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.140]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.200]   and it's been far and away the best sleep
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   that I've ever had.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.440]   Much so, that when I travel to hotels and Airbnbs,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.720]   I find I don't sleep as well.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.120]   I can't wait to get back to my Dusk mattress.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   So if you'd like to try Helix,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.560]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   Take that two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.780]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.460]   that's customized for your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.320]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.500]   to get up to 25% off.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.280]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.960]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.160]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.720]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.380]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.880]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.360]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.340]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.180]   just as important as getting regular exercise.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.520]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.860]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.200]   First, it provides a good rapport with somebody
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.160]   that you can really trust and talk to
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.360]   about any and all issues that concern you.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   Second of all, great therapy provides support
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440]   in the form of emotional support,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.880]   but also directed guidance, the do's and the not to do's.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.840]   And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.280]   at useful insights that you would not have arrived
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.260]   at otherwise, insights that allow you to do better,
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.900]   not just in your emotional life, in your relationship life,
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.560]   but also the relationship to yourself
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.380]   and your professional life and all sorts of career goals.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.920]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.160]   to find an expert therapist
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.780]   with whom you can really resonate with
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.280]   and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.340]   Also, because BetterHelp is carried out entirely online,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.560]   it's very time-efficient
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   and easy to fit into a busy schedule.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.200]   So if you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.600]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.700]   to get 10% off your first month.

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.400]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Bernardo Huberman.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.040]   Dr. Bernardo Huberman, welcome.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.200]   - And also great to see you, dad.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.280]   - Same here.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.140]   - I guess no premonition would have foreseen this one.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.640]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.780]   - And people might notice today
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.460]   I'm drinking out of a mate gourd,
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.220]   in part in honor of my father's father
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.180]   who drank out of his loose leaf mate every morning.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.540]   My first sip of mate was taken sitting in his lap
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.780]   when I was maybe four years old.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.620]   - Yes, yes.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.020]   - In my Spider-Man pajamas.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.860]   In any event, let's talk about science.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.300]   You're born in Argentina.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.700]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.660]   - As I recall, because once we had a conversation about it,
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.700]   you had a teacher, maybe it was in high school,
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.500]   who turned you on to physics,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.300]   which became your field of choice.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.140]   - Yes, yes.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.500]   - But prior to that,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.020]   were you interested in different subjects?
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.180]   I don't recall if you had an avid interest in academics
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.020]   or you just did it because you were supposed to
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.260]   prior to that teacher.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.300]   Then we'll talk about him.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.140]   - Yes, yes.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.300]   I was always very interested in ideas and so on.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.660]   Science at that time was a bit vague,
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.180]   but I'd read a lot of philosophy.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.020]   I didn't understand much of what I read,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.780]   but nevertheless, I kept reading it.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.460]   I was interested in psychology.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.940]   I was an avid reader.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.060]   As a matter of fact, I embarrassed my father,
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.020]   or actually made him disappointed for a birthday.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.580]   I think I was 14 years old.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.100]   I asked him to buy me the 12 volumes of Freud's writings.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.940]   - Really?
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.460]   - Yeah, and he said, "What for?"
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.780]   But I was very impressed with it.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.940]   Of course, I couldn't even understand
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.420]   half of what these books had in them.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.260]   So I was very interested in many things.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.700]   And I must say to you that my interest in science,
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.940]   in particular physics,
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.500]   doesn't come from the standard thing
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.340]   that you see here in the United States mostly.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.420]   Namely, I was not a whiz kid in math.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.260]   I was not one of these people that can really do things
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.460]   very, very quickly and so on.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.020]   But I was interested because I thought that physics
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   was gonna complement my attempt at understanding
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.340]   how the whole universe is put together.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.220]   The philosophers were saying all sorts of things.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.700]   I went to a very special school
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.900]   that I learned six years of Latin and so on.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.020]   And I had to read things like Kant and Cosmogonies
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.420]   and so on that really didn't mean much to me.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.820]   But suddenly I started discovering
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.380]   that physics might be interesting.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.100]   And I had a cousin, Hector, who was a physicist,
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.660]   a particle physicist already.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.100]   I mean, he was living at that time in France.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.500]   And so there was a little bit of that influence.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.660]   But my interest was in things that had to do
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.940]   with fairly abstract ideas.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.220]   I cannot believe that at one point or the other
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.900]   I was very good in geometry class,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.380]   being able to prove theorems.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.300]   I mean, the teacher would just say, "Let's prove this."
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.140]   And I was somehow able to reason through
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.260]   and come to some proofs.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.380]   So I think that I was very interested in ideas
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.500]   and not necessarily in the very concrete aspects
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.220]   of science at that time.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.340]   - Can I ask you a question about early schooling?
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.820]   So if I remember correctly,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.300]   you were born naturally left-handed.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.140]   - Yes.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.980]   - They forced you to learn to write with your right hand.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.820]   - Yes.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.420]   - You went to a very strict schools.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.300]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.140]   - Like military levels of strictness.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.740]   - Almost, yes, yes.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.140]   This is a very interesting type of education.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.980]   They have it in France.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.780]   It's called the lycee in France.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.900]   And this is a very special school in Argentina
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.220]   was actually founded in the 1500s by the Jesuits.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.660]   And my father went to that school.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.740]   And so he wanted me to go there.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.340]   And my brother went there too.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.740]   And in six years of a very strict education,
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.380]   mostly humanistic, I learned Greek and learned Latin.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.780]   I learned immense amounts of history, which I loved.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.220]   And there were other courses, you know, French and so on.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.980]   In French, we had to memorize incredibly long poems
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.300]   that we had to recite.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.420]   - Do you still remember some of them?
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.900]   Because sometimes early memories are embedded so deeply.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.740]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.460]   And my brother and I sometimes tell each other
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.380]   some of the pieces of these poems.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.220]   Yes, yes.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.500]   And I'll say something right now to foreshadow
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.220]   what will likely happen several times
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.180]   throughout today's discussion,
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.220]   which is anytime that my father is in the presence
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.540]   of his brother, my uncle, Carlos,
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.780]   they start laughing about jokes that they've been telling
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.180]   over and over back and forth with one another
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.740]   since they were a young kid.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.700]   So just the mere mention of his brother
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.940]   will bring a bit of a smile and a chuckle
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.860]   to both of our faces.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.700]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.860]   So I'd learned a lot of French.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.500]   And also my parents decided, my mother mostly,
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.060]   that I had to learn French and English.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.300]   And I went to Alliance Francaise,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.820]   where for five years I went there.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.020]   I was essentially the only boy in the class,
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.060]   which was very nice in a way.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.740]   And in order to graduate,
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.940]   I essentially, you know, to be fluent in French.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.500]   But in the special school I went to,
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.780]   the discipline was very straight, very straight.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.300]   You know, we were supposed to do things
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.340]   you don't do in the United States.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.020]   The moment the teacher walks in, everybody stands up.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.340]   And if you're late and standing up,
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.980]   you're just kicked out of the classroom
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.660]   and things of that sort.
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.380]   But it was a lovely experience in many ways
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.260]   when I reflect on it,
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.060]   because it gave me a humanistic education
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.820]   that has been incredibly useful in my career.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.580]   Most people don't realize that.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.660]   I mean, I tend to think of things in a very broad context,
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.900]   and it's because of the education I had.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.740]   Okay, so, and I loved the history of Rome,
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.100]   and I'd learned to recite things in Latin.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.220]   And so it was very, very, I enjoyed that very, very much.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.940]   My brother didn't, actually, and so.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.100]   - Well, you two are very different.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.660]   I have great, great adoration for Carlos,
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.900]   but you two are very different.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.740]   And along those lines,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.780]   I was just about to ask or mention,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.260]   and some of our Argentine
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.220]   and South American listeners generally,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.020]   and perhaps even European listeners,
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.140]   might be shocked and perhaps disappointed
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.580]   to learn that you're one of the few Argentines
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.260]   that I know who doesn't care much
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.020]   for the game of football, soccer.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.580]   It doesn't seem to concern you much at all.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.060]   - No, no.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.980]   The reasons for that are sort of interesting, I think.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.940]   I've reflected on that,
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.100]   because my own wife likes to watch a soccer game.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.940]   I mean, she's Danish.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.180]   She likes the European tournaments.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.100]   I never liked mob behavior.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.020]   I never liked this whole passionate involvement
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.860]   in these things.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.700]   I don't know why.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.420]   I was never able to understand it,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.020]   to the point that I never went to a soccer game
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.860]   till the week before I left for the United States.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.460]   My brother insisted that I had to go to a soccer game,
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.900]   and this is sort of embarrassing,
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.100]   but at one point or the other,
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.980]   it's someone, you know, there was a good goal,
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.620]   and so I stood up and said, "This is great,"
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.220]   and I turned out I was on the wrong side of the audience,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.140]   and people got very, almost violent with me, you know?
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.780]   So, yeah, soccer to me is something that I watch,
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.260]   but I'm not passionate about.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.100]   - Right.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.300]   - Yeah, I never really felt that it was that interesting.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.020]   Although, you know, I was in a rowing team.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.860]   I learned boxing.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.420]   I did a lot of sports,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.620]   but I don't like that much of spectator sports,
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.460]   like tennis.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.420]   I played tennis since I was a teenager.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.340]   - I'm not a spectator sport fan either.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.340]   The other day, someone asked me
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.620]   what my favorite sports team is.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.460]   You'll like this.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.780]   And I said the Harlem Globetrotters
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.020]   because they're undefeated.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.060]   They have the best record,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.140]   and that was actually the one professional sports team game
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.180]   you took me to when I was a kid.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.740]   We'd always go see the Globetrotters.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.580]   - Yes.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.420]   - They're undefeated.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.700]   - Yes, unbelievable, yes, yes.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.580]   - And my father took me to see them too.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.180]   They're fantastic, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.020]   - I love it.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.780]   So your father was not a scientist.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.620]   - No.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.380]   - Your brother's not a scientist,
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.060]   and you were fated, according to them,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.180]   to join the family business.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.940]   But then you had a teacher who exposed you to physics.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.820]   - To physics and to the notion
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.260]   of being authentic in what you want.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.740]   There were two parts to it.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.220]   He was a very interesting and tormented man, I felt,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.180]   but it was very interesting.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.300]   He would come into the class.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.340]   Most of the students, you know,
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.260]   really didn't care about what he was saying.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.780]   And so I was fascinated,
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.220]   not only by what he was saying,
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.420]   but his whole personality.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.180]   But I need to say something here that is important.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.420]   I also was rather irresponsible.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.300]   You see, I grew up in a family, a well-to-do family,
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.260]   that I never thought I was going to make a living.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.740]   So it was easy to be interested in science or anything
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.900]   because, you know, it's what you do.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.700]   Yeah, it's, you know, you're interested in culture.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.700]   You read books, you do things.
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.900]   But my father used to say,
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.460]   what are you going to do once you graduate?
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.540]   You don't want to start teaching in elementary schools
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.580]   or something of that sort.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.620]   My brother used to say, if he does physics,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.460]   I'll have to support him because he still says that.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.860]   - So scientists were considered poor.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.700]   - Poor, yeah.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.540]   Yeah, they couldn't get a job.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.260]   I mean, science in Argentina.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.660]   Argentina has a big tradition in medical sciences.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.980]   I think two or three Nobel Prizes and so on.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.740]   But in physics, they produce some very good physicists.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.260]   One of them lives in the United States.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.340]   I mean, he's very, very famous, Maldacena.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.820]   I haven't met him, but I know he's one of the top people
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.060]   in the field.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.060]   But I just got into this because I was interested.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.780]   It sounded, you know, fascinating and abstract
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.980]   and the ideas were so powerful.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.140]   And I think, and, you know, I reflected a lot on this.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.380]   When you're psychologically in adolescence,
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.340]   because my parents made me jump two grades.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.020]   So I was much younger than my classmates.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.700]   And that created a lot of problems for me.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.020]   I mean, at the time when, you know, you're developing
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.220]   and so on, all the boys were talking about girls
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.300]   and so on, I still was really interested,
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.420]   understanding why the excitement and so on,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.700]   you know, I was very young.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.060]   But it gave me a sense of order.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.780]   You know, reading a book about physics
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.940]   and understanding that there are laws
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.940]   that tell you how things work,
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.580]   gave me a tremendous sense of order and power.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.340]   So, you know, everything else was a little bit in flow
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.260]   and the family and my own relationships with friends
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.180]   and girlfriends or whatever.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.340]   And going back to science, it was just a sense
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.700]   of, I don't know, I still remember those days.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.660]   It was very, very soothing in a way.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.020]   - So it's like a touchstone.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.380]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.220]   - And what grade were you, this teacher,
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.100]   was this like middle school, high school?
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.340]   - Yeah, no, yeah, high school, yeah.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.660]   I was 13 or 14 years old, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.740]   When I finally, I started listening to this
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.180]   and I said, wow, this is impressive.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.020]   You know, it's powerful.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.780]   There are ways to know what's true and what's not true.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.060]   You know, you just don't speculate on things.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.740]   So, but most of this stuff, I didn't really understand.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.380]   Then I had this cousin of mine, Hector,
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.460]   who was already gone, but I would go to his parents' house
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.980]   and there, there were his books,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   all these incredible books on quantum mechanics,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.540]   relativity, and I would just take them home.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.660]   And I didn't really comprehend a lot of the math,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.340]   but somehow it seemed impressive.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.580]   It was like looking into a mechanism or something.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.500]   So, and I used to take them to school.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.340]   And one of my teachers once said, you know,
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.620]   you seem to interested in this,
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.620]   but you don't understand it.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.580]   So, you need to, you need to learn it.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.420]   And he was the one who started pushing me into this.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.420]   On the other hand, my family was saying,
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.020]   you should become a lawyer.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.580]   Just, you know, my brother and father.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.140]   - And that never interested you?
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.220]   - No.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   I, it's interesting because now I'm very interested
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.260]   in aspects of constitutional law and so on.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.020]   When I hear about arguments against, you know,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.740]   the Supreme Court and so on,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.340]   I became very interested in law and economics later on.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.940]   I mean, just to read about it.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.700]   But what my father was talking about
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.980]   at the dining room table,
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.500]   it was all about strategies of, you know,
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.580]   getting something done half an hour before the opposition.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.500]   So you win a case.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.740]   I mean, I was totally interested in that.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.060]   - I'm sensing a bit of a theme,
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.380]   which is that social dynamics and what other people do,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.420]   regardless of whether or not they like it,
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   or it earns them a particular living,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.820]   didn't capture you.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.660]   Like the idea that people and their groups
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.940]   and their ways of thinking and behaving,
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.180]   while they may not bother you, it doesn't,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.220]   it didn't captivate you.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.580]   The way that like, it sounds like physics, you know,
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.860]   made you think that there's something kind of bigger,
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.140]   that there's something more universal.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.980]   - Right.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.820]   - Which indeed physics is, right?
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.260]   It's not, it is, it explains most everything.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.940]   - Yes, and I- - Most everything.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.060]   - Yes, and I also think that I was a bit of a loner.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.180]   It was very hard to find people that, you know,
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.620]   I mean, children or young people that thought like me.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.180]   So eventually I became part of a group.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.020]   We were four or five guys that used to get together
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.500]   on Saturdays and, you know, go to the movies and so on.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.980]   And then afterwards discuss, you know,
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.340]   whatever we were interested in.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.060]   And so I was, I was only 16 years old, you know,
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.980]   and deciding what to do with my life.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.580]   Of all four of us, we committed.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.780]   There were, some of them came
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.980]   from incredibly wealthy families, two of them.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.620]   We committed to really be true to ourselves
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.740]   and pursue what we liked.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.100]   But I was the only one.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.380]   The other two ended up running the business
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.340]   of their parents.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.740]   And one of them essentially, I don't know what he did.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.380]   I saw him years later.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.980]   - Money becomes a pretty, a bright beacon
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.980]   for a lot of people.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.140]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.900]   - Yeah, I'm grateful to you that you never pushed me
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.740]   to go in any particular direction.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.580]   - Right.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.340]   - You pushed me to not go in particular directions,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.220]   but never with respect to academic choices.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.420]   In fact, I don't recall you telling me or Laura,
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.460]   that by the way, folks, that's my sister's name,
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.580]   that we had to do anything except attend our classes
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.020]   and do our best.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.420]   But I never felt pushed to go into science.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.340]   - No. - No.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.020]   - Although you had a little bit of a curiosity about it.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   - Animals.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.940]   - Animals, and I remember I was going through a period
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.380]   in which I started getting convinced
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.180]   that there was very little to do in physics
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.180]   and I wanted to change.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.060]   And one day on a bike ride,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.260]   I think I was carrying in the back of my bike and bicycle,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.420]   you were young.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   You asked me, "What is the unsolved problem?"
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.100]   And I said, "I don't think it's in physics,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.020]   "but it's the brain."
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.060]   And you said, "Okay, I'll go into that."
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.740]   You said, "I'll never forget that."
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.180]   - Well, it's interesting.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.580]   I'm fascinated by human memory, as you know,
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.540]   I know you are as well.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.940]   And I recall that story as well.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.140]   I recall it slightly differently,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.060]   but we're really closely aligned.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.220]   Which is, I remember you used to walk me to school
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.540]   in the morning and you would drop me off
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.780]   at the cut through to the path behind Gunn High School.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.140]   Because that's, I would pick up Kristen Harnett
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.900]   across the street.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.980]   And you told me it would be better
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   if I picked her up by myself
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.540]   and walked her to the end of the street,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.300]   which is where class was.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.800]   You were teaching me chivalry.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.980]   And I remember asking you what you do.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.980]   I was probably five or six years.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.900]   Well, let's see, first grade.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.020]   So it'd probably be somewhere around six or seven years old.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.940]   I asked you what you do and you said, "Physics."
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.820]   And I said, "Well, what is that?"
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.220]   And you said, "Well, let me tell you
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.580]   "the feeling it gives me instead."
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.540]   You said, "You know, the night before your birthday?"
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.380]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.940]   And he said, "You know that feeling?"
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.020]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.740]   And you said, "Well, that's how I feel
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.020]   "every day when I go to work."
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.220]   And I remember, I'll never forget that.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.100]   And I said, "What do you do?"
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.660]   And you said, "I'm a physicist."
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.900]   And I said, "Well, then I'll be a physicist."
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.980]   And then I recall,
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.500]   so maybe we had the conversation twice,
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.900]   you saying, "Well, most of the big problems
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.940]   "in physics are solved.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.780]   "So you should pick something perhaps
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.820]   "a little less untread like."
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.660]   And I said, "Like what?"
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.580]   And you said, "Well, the brain is pretty interesting."
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.060]   And then I said, "Okay, I'll work on that."
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.420]   - Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.540]   This issue of feeling like before your birthday
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.580]   is something I remember saying to you.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.740]   I don't recall feeling that way every day.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.100]   I do recall feeling like this when I had an idea
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.740]   and finally worked out and we wrote a paper and so on.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.180]   You know, it was an incredibly exciting time.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.820]   It's, you know, well, you know about it.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.100]   You've done it yourself now.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.980]   And so I wanted to convey that to you.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.220]   It was very, very interesting and important to me
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.500]   that you understood that.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.900]   On the other hand, it made me feel very isolated as well,
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.300]   not only with you, with everybody.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.940]   I mean, it's a very esoteric field.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.740]   You know, you used to walk into the study,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.820]   look at me, you know, writing equations and so on.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.580]   And what you say, what's that, you know?
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.140]   - I was thinking about your study,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.380]   which was just a door down from my childhood bedroom.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.380]   I still remember the way that your study smelled.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.620]   I can still smell it.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.020]   I have an incredible sense of memory for certain things.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.060]   I can still remember,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.500]   but I remember how your books were aligned,
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.900]   where your stereo was placed,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.260]   your photos, your photo of Einstein,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.100]   your photos of me and Lara and mom.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.460]   I remember all of it.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.780]   And the sofa that was just off behind it
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.900]   because you're a nap taker, like,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.260]   which I inherited from you.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.900]   But I remember that, yeah,
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.580]   you would spend a lot of time in that office
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.660]   and listening to classical music.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.460]   Do you listen to music while you work
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.420]   or did you listen? - All the time.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.820]   All the time, yeah.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.740]   Classical music for me is something I discovered
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.580]   very young, very young.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.620]   My parents also loved classical music, my brother too.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.580]   And it's something that I, to me,
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.420]   has a tremendous emotional resonance with the way I feel.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.140]   Sometimes it's background music.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.940]   Sometimes I'd really listen very carefully.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.340]   It's something that I, yes,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.340]   I've always had in my life and still have it.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.420]   I mean, it's very, very important to me.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.740]   - But not many musicians in our family.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   - No, unfortunately, yeah.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.460]   Although there is a very famous one.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.700]   - We've all tried.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.540]   We've all tried.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.340]   - Yeah, yeah, you in particular, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.180]   - We all failed.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.540]   There is a very famous Huberman,
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.740]   the great violinist, Bronislav Huberman.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.580]   I mean, there's a picture.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.420]   I think I sent it to you.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.860]   He and Einstein, he was one of the greatest violinists
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.820]   in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.780]   An incredibly interesting man.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.580]   He's the founder of the Israel Philharmonic.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.620]   And that's one of the reasons that the name Huberman
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.060]   is in some street in Israel, because of him.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.060]   - Are we related to him?
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   - Unfortunately not.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.660]   (both laughing)
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.340]   - Which explains the lack of musical prowess in our family.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.860]   We all love music, but none of us are good musicians.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.980]   - No, right, yes.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.180]   - Except my cousin Diego.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.860]   - Diego, he has a perfect ear,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.020]   so he can really do interesting things, yes, yeah.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:50.020]   - So going back to your childhood, this teacher.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.260]   - Yes.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.780]   - So, I mean, what was it?
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.500]   You already had a sort of seeded an interest
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.500]   in finding order, in things that made the world make sense.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:06.060]   What was the political situation in Argentina at that time?
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.580]   - Quite horrible parts of it.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.860]   I mean, there was a dictatorship
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.220]   that lasted for a long time, this Perón thing, and so on.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.780]   It was, I mean, he was really a follower of Mussolini
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.740]   and people of that sort in World War II.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.540]   - So what did that mean like out in the streets?
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.460]   Like you grew up in the heart of Buenos Aires,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.260]   but like, what did that mean in terms of,
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.820]   I mean, was there poverty everywhere?
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.700]   Were people, I mean, was there violence?
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.900]   I mean, what does it spell out to you?
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.460]   - Well, it was a very oppressive regime.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.820]   I mean, you had to be careful what you talked about,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.100]   you know, in my family, like most of that social class,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.660]   we had maids and a cook,
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.380]   and so you had to be very careful what you said.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.940]   - Because they would run that information back?
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.140]   - Absolutely, and people, and your grandfather,
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.220]   my father, at one point or the other,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.020]   was prevented from coming to visit me in the United States
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.940]   because he was classified as a communist
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.300]   because he did not join the Perónist party.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.980]   - Okay, for the record, we are not communists.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.300]   We are both big believers in capitalism
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.220]   sitting here at this table, right.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.940]   - So, no, and so it was terrible.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.260]   It was a terrible time.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.500]   It was a very oppressive time.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.660]   - But he wasn't a communist, either.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.620]   - No, of course not.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.660]   Of course, no, no, he was on the other side.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.380]   But the idea at that time, it was to be classified as such.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.540]   Eventually, that information leaked to the,
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.420]   obviously, to the American authorities,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.940]   so when he asked for a visa, they denied him.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.300]   It was a very complicated story.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.700]   I don't think we should waste time
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.740]   to know how it got eventually resolved
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.620]   through a friend of mine who was a priest
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.620]   just here in the United States.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.940]   But the point being that, during that time,
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.860]   it was a very, you had to be very careful
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.500]   the way you spoke, the way you said things.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.340]   There was a dictatorship that was very much
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.020]   like the fascist in Italy, you know,
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.220]   and actually, that dictatorship lasted
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.260]   until a few years ago, because as you know,
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.540]   or as you heard, the new president we have
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.140]   is one that actually ran against
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.460]   this whole ideology, Peronism, and so on.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.300]   - Millet.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.140]   - Millet, yes.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.780]   So, I was never, I was not political at all,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.700]   but you have to be careful.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.660]   But it was a funny time.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.540]   And when he was overthrown through a military revolution,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.580]   you know, my parents were delighted,
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.220]   and I remember the celebrations and so on.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.860]   But that was considered the minority that was against him.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.420]   You know, it was a social class movement.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.780]   The working class was behind Peron
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.380]   and what he promised and what he gave them.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.100]   So, but that eventually died.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.620]   So, the real problem was that there was no real commitment
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.620]   to science as an investment that a country should make.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.060]   Yes, it was nice to have Nobel Prizes,
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.460]   and it's culturally good,
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.380]   but they didn't have the pragmatic notions
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.700]   that we have, see, in the United States,
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.220]   of doing science means solving concrete problems.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.980]   - And this was in the 1950s.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.820]   - The '60s, too.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.540]   - Right, so this was the, like,
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   one of the biggest and fastest progressions of physics
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.140]   and its implementation in the US.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.980]   - Yes.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.820]   - So, were you hearing about that?
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.460]   - Of course, I was following it all,
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.300]   and I wanted to, you know,
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.340]   I wanted to buy books about it and so on.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.580]   I had some conflicts with my father about spending money
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.540]   on books that he thought
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.540]   that were not gonna take me anywhere and so on.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.580]   I mean, he was a very pragmatic lawyer.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.380]   He didn't understand why I was doing these things.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.140]   So, yes, I was aware of everything.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.300]   And actually, the university was very good.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.380]   I entered the university.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.300]   You had to choose what you wanted to do,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.460]   and after a tremendous crisis, personal crisis,
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.100]   I decided not to go into law or engineering,
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.300]   which was the alternative my father offered,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   and I decided to study physics.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.100]   And I didn't regret it at all.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   It was a very impressive time.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.220]   You know, I got a good education in physics,
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.660]   a little bit too abstract.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.300]   - So, this was experimental physics
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.740]   or theoretical physics? - Both, both, both.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.140]   In the lab, I was okay.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.100]   I mean, I was better in classes on advanced,
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.860]   I took a lot of courses in advanced mathematics
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.540]   and calculus and beyond that,
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.740]   and, you know, complex analysis and so on.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.900]   - So, it turns out you were good at math after all.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.900]   - Good, yes, I understand math.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.540]   I'm not a whiz.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.860]   I mean, like many of my students have been.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.260]   I had guys that can do incredible things, you know,
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.300]   that I can't do them, but slowly.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.860]   I understand, yes, yes.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.900]   So, but yeah, physics is something
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.060]   that I knew how to be intuitive about it.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.420]   I had already interesting ideas
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.380]   that perhaps didn't pan out, but yeah.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.300]   - So, the teacher in high school,
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.980]   were they the one that told you
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.340]   that there was like a career in this thing?
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.300]   - Yes, he said, you know,
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.980]   you should devote yourself to this
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.580]   if you really care about it.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.180]   He was a man that obviously,
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.500]   he was sort of tormented on many levels and so on.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.580]   - You say that because of the way
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.860]   he carried himself physically?
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.860]   - Yes, yes, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.620]   He was troubled, but was interesting, intense man.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.660]   I still remember his name.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.580]   He was a philosopher, his name was Egesland,
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.300]   which is a German name.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.820]   And he started talking about, you know,
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.460]   discovering, you know, Christianity
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.700]   and what it meant to him
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.060]   and what it is to be authentic and so on.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.380]   So, and then I had a very large exposure
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.780]   to the great thinkers of the antiquity,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.500]   then, you know, Roman and Greek.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.300]   So, it was all, to me, fascinating, interesting,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.140]   you know, and it was good to have friends
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.780]   that I could discuss these things with.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.300]   - Do you think it's a disservice
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.780]   that nowadays in the United States,
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.020]   and even when I was growing up,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.660]   but especially now that we don't force kids
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.180]   to be exposed to all these topics?
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.540]   Like, we try and track people into something early on.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.460]   Actually, a recent guest told me
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.660]   that many schools are now just giving knowledge,
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.580]   but not expecting kids to do problem sets.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.860]   You know, teaching them about physical activity,
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.940]   but not expecting them to do physical activity, seriously.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.940]   - Well, that sounds a little bit funny.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.900]   - Well, no, but that's, I mean,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.460]   that is the direction that education
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.820]   in this country is going.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.460]   - I was a visiting professor in France.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.260]   Actually, you live there because of that, in Paris.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.300]   And I discovered, you know,
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.140]   the French intellectual tradition
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.980]   is also very, very abstract compared to the American.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.060]   I mean, the English and the Americans
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.980]   are the ones that took physics,
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.460]   and the Russians too,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.100]   into a very, very practical realm
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.860]   and made progress that are very, very concrete,
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.900]   almost engineering-like.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.140]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.780]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.340]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.460]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.900]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.980]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.140]   and it tastes great.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.900]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.300]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.780]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.660]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.980]   to purchase one supplement,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.020]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.420]   The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.100]   most of my foods from whole foods
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.900]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.620]   vegetables, vitamins, and minerals,
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.780]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.700]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.500]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.780]   I sleep well at night,
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.980]   and keep my immune system strong.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.460]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.140]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.860]   my physical health, my mental health,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.940]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.740]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.620]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   I also notice, and this makes perfect sense
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.700]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.220]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.660]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.800]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.940]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.420]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.540]   you can go to DrinkAG1.com/Huberman
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.900]   to claim a special offer.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.140]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.700]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.180]   Again, that's DrinkAG1.com/Huberman
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.940]   to claim that special offer.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.220]   - When I came to the United States,
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.700]   I must tell you, I came as a graduate student
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.620]   at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.460]   - Let's talk about that.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.460]   So how did you end up getting into the United States
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.300]   as a graduate student?
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.140]   You applied.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.540]   - Yeah, I was graduating,
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.820]   and the future looked rather gloomy.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.020]   I had a girlfriend whose father was very wealthy,
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.820]   and she said, "No problem, you're gonna work for my dad,"
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.460]   and she got a factory or whatever.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.420]   - Why do I feel like that is not the kind of offer
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.300]   that you'll go for?
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.800]   - No, no, not at all, not at all.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.140]   - I've never known you to work for anyone, except you.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:12.980]   - Yeah, in a way, you're right.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.820]   - I'm a bit the same.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.180]   - Yeah, yeah, so yes, yes.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.780]   Just the idea of running a business was not...
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.780]   I was truly idealistic and irresponsible too,
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.100]   but I had a cousin who was already got his PhD
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.420]   in theoretical physics at Columbia University,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.900]   was a professor in France, then Sweden, and so on.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.780]   So I felt that perhaps I should go to the United States,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.660]   and so I started applying to this.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.100]   My father was saying, "I won't even help you with this."
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.900]   He didn't like, my parents didn't like it.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.300]   I was very close to my family in many ways,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.820]   and so I applied to many places.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.140]   I remember being accepted at, I think it was Cornell,
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.980]   and I said, "Oh, New York, that's great."
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.820]   'Til someone said to me,
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.180]   "You have to take a plane to go to real New York."
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.740]   - Yeah, he loves New York City.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.180]   We both love New York City. - If that guy's not for you.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.580]   So in any event, I got this very, very nice fellowship
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.180]   to go to University of Pennsylvania, which is-
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.740]   - Who's the fellowship from?
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.020]   - The Navy, the United States Navy, yeah.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.060]   I'm very grateful for that,
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.540]   and I actually wrote that in my PhD thesis.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.460]   I was very grateful, and I think it was incredible
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.620]   that they were supporting that kind of research.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.060]   - They wanted to bring you to the US to build weapons?
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.580]   - No, no, no, not at all, not at all.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.340]   I came to the United States working for Professor Burstein,
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.100]   who just died at the age of 101,
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.300]   and no, but I was supported by the United States Navy.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.780]   It was a fellowship by the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.300]   But I remember in my first interview
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.220]   with some of the teachers, professors,
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.580]   that I am talking to them
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.300]   about the foundations of quantum mechanics,
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.580]   and the guy says to me,
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.740]   "Let me give you an interesting problem.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.020]   "You have a ping-pong ball,
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.740]   "but instead of being a classical ping-pong ball,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.580]   "it's a quantum one.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.540]   "Could you tell me at what heights will it bounce?"
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   I had no idea what to do.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.660]   I had no sense that you could turn all this knowledge
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.780]   into something implementable, practical, and so on.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.380]   So it was quite a struggle the first year.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.220]   - So you had theoretical understanding,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.260]   not experimental understanding.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.380]   - Right, right, yes, or empirical, and so on.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.060]   I didn't know how to calculate things very well, yeah.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.900]   I didn't think it was--
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.940]   - Despite being good at math.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.020]   - I was good, yeah, math, understanding the math.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.180]   There's a difference thing between understanding math,
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.220]   implemented, and creating things.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.300]   Well, you learn that.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.460]   I had four years of graduate school,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.940]   and got my PhD in physics,
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.060]   so obviously I learned how to do it.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.660]   But what I'm saying is that I had this very,
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.460]   very vague theoretical understanding of what the world worked,
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.500]   but not really practical.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   I didn't have it at my fingertips.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.060]   That's what you learn when you go to graduate school,
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.700]   as you know yourself, okay?
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.540]   So that's--
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.660]   - Yeah, it's one thing to learn about the brain
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.500]   as an undergraduate,
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.820]   but in graduate school is where I learned
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.780]   how to slice brains, stain brains, trace connections,
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.460]   record from neurons, and it's a whole other business
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.860]   to get your hands dirty in the thing.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.820]   - Absolutely, absolutely, and the same thing for me.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.940]   Yeah, I'm taking courses
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.380]   and discovering what you like and dislike.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.180]   I was a little bit bound to my professor
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.260]   because he was the one who gave me the fellowship,
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.740]   but I didn't like what he did,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.540]   which was always very problematic.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.100]   - Did you have a good relationship?
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:05.940]   - It was funny.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.900]   He sort of became, tried to become my surrogate father,
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.340]   but on the other hand, intellectually,
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.180]   I always felt that the guy was not quite there.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.300]   I mean, he was very famous and so on,
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.140]   but--
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.300]   - He's a member in the National Academy.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.860]   - He was not, but he was very famous, very famous,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.020]   but I always felt that there was a lack of depth
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.460]   into what we were doing.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.420]   It was not just him.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.460]   It was just the solid state physics.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.380]   There was a very famous, you know,
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.020]   Mary Gell-Mann, who had total contempt
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.980]   for solid state physics.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.820]   She used to call it squalid state physics.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.340]   - For those that don't know Mary Gell-Mann,
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.140]   we'll get to Murray later
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.740]   because I had the interesting experience
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.860]   of meeting him as a child,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.380]   but he discovered the quark.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.420]   He won the Nobel Prize in many ways
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   is considered at least as superb a physicist
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.700]   as Feynman, maybe better.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.140]   Yeah, lesser known, but among physicists,
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.900]   you know, would evoke great fear in everybody.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.700]   We'll get to Murray in a little bit.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.860]   So did you enjoy graduate school?
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.780]   - Yes, but it was incredibly hard.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.620]   Very hard.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.460]   The first year in Toba.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.860]   And also personally, I was very lonely.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.540]   You know, I say I was transplanted
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.820]   into a whole different world.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.580]   Philadelphia is not a city I would recommend
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.260]   too many people to live in.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.460]   I escaped every weekend to New York
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.780]   and my professor was always upset about that.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.020]   - And you went from being pretty well off financially
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.460]   to basically having no money.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.660]   - I had no money.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.260]   I lived on very little money as a matter of fact, yes.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.100]   My parents, my father felt that,
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.260]   okay, this is what you're gonna do.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.660]   You're gonna survive on this.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.580]   They paid for a ticket once a year to go back to visit.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.900]   And it was incredibly nice and soothing to be back
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.100]   and to be taken care of and everything else,
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.140]   you know, the life and the family.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.820]   And then going back again to Philadelphia
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.260]   and the reality of just being a student.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.980]   Unlike many people and foreign students
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.900]   that were with me in other places,
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.140]   I did not enjoy,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.780]   I mean, it was quite a cultural adventure for me
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.900]   to meet people from all over the world,
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.060]   to learn what they,
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.660]   I became very close to a Japanese postdoc,
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.580]   a very interesting man.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.340]   But I was quite miserable.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.980]   - So this was in the mid '60s?
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.300]   - Yes, yes, late '60s, yes, yeah.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.620]   I did not like my life there at all.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.100]   I mean, I lived for four years.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.900]   I didn't have a single girlfriend or anything.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.460]   I, you know, I dated and so on,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.260]   but I just felt that I was transplanted
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.340]   into an environment that I didn't like.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.740]   Okay, and on top of that,
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.860]   my conflict with my advisor were not serious
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.420]   because they were not overt,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.740]   but they were there all the time.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.580]   - That can be tough.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.420]   For those listening,
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.140]   the relationship to your graduate advisor
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.060]   is a potentially wonderful,
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.340]   a potentially hazardous one
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.300]   because they exert enormous control over your future,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.060]   not just through letters of recommendation,
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.100]   but opportunities.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.580]   And I got lucky in that sense.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.500]   - You were very lucky, yes.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.220]   My advisor was the kind of person
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.460]   that if you went out to dinner with him,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.900]   he ordered for you.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.740]   - Are you kidding me?
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.020]   - I'm not kidding.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.940]   He was that kind of guy.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.820]   He would take the whole group to a Chinese restaurant.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.620]   And before you said, "I don't like this,"
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.300]   he just ordered.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.780]   Once he took me for a whole weekend to his summer house
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.700]   to finish a paper.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.500]   The guy couldn't finish a paper.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.100]   And it was, I was a mess.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.740]   And he, and his daughter was there.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.620]   She was 16 or 17.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.660]   And she said, "Are you two going to talk physics?"
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.300]   I was going to say, "No, let's go for a walk."
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.140]   He said, "That's all we're going to do."
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.340]   But the physics consisted in him regurgitating
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.260]   whatever we were doing.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.740]   I mean, I remember I was so miserable
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.860]   looking at my watch,
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.420]   seeing how the heck do I get out of here?
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.660]   I didn't have a car.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.580]   So I was sort of his prisoner for,
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.540]   from Friday to Sunday night.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.060]   So it was hard for me.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.260]   I never really felt that happy.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.060]   On the other hand, I had no other options at that time.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.900]   Okay.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.220]   So, but then as soon as I graduated, I got out.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.660]   So.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.060]   - I was just thinking about how different
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.420]   your graduate school experience was from mine.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.940]   I, you know, I delighted in my advisors, you know.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.780]   She was amazing.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.620]   - You had fantastic people.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.580]   - Yeah, I got lucky.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.220]   And I got a lot of that from you,
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.220]   which was to, for those who don't know,
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.180]   I left a program at Berkeley,
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.380]   which everyone thought I was insane.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.180]   Insane to leave Berkeley to go to Davis.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.620]   That was by choice.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.940]   But I remember what you said.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.460]   You said, "How big is your incoming class at Davis?"
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.300]   Right?
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   Because by all standard criteria,
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.140]   Berkeley is the better institution.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.100]   Davis is great,
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.820]   but Berkeley's considered exceptionally strong.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.580]   And I said, "There are three of us."
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.340]   And you said, "Well, either you're making
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.180]   the best decision of your life
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.940]   or the worst mistake of your life."
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.540]   And then I think you asked me
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.780]   what was driving the decision.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.700]   I said, "Well, there's this person there.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.740]   Her name is Barbara Chapman.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.860]   And she just seems to be working on things
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.220]   that if I don't work on these problems,
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.740]   I'm gonna regret it.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.900]   And I can't imagine working on anything else."
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.500]   And you said, "Well, go for it."
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.220]   Which I really appreciate because any parent,
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.420]   if I were a parent and my kid said,
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.140]   "I'm gonna leave Berkeley and go to Davis
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.340]   halfway through a PhD and start again."
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.940]   I think I probably would have balked, so.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.740]   - Well, Barbara also played a very, very nice,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.140]   supportive, emotional role in your life.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.980]   I mean, it was obvious
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.900]   that she had tremendous preference for you.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.740]   - Yeah.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.340]   - You were like her son in many ways.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.700]   - I smile and well up a little bit
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.420]   only because, well, she passed away young,
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.180]   but she's just an amazing person.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.580]   So I feel very blessed for that.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.500]   That wasn't your experience with your advisor.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.100]   So during that time, I did wanna ask about this.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.740]   I asked about it being the mid to late '60s
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.380]   because it was the counterculture movement.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.300]   - Yes, yeah, right.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.500]   - And one thing that people should know about you,
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   I'll just offer this up,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.860]   is that in the entire time I've known you,
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.400]   which is a while now,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.940]   you've been very clear.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.140]   Like you never had any interest in recreational drugs.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.980]   - No.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.820]   - Never did 'em.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.640]   - No.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.480]   - Even though that was super common then.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.320]   - Yes.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.140]   - I've never seen you have more than a glass of wine.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.180]   - Yes.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.500]   - You'd never been drunk in your life.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.820]   - Never.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.980]   - And you don't like football,
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.180]   despite being from Argentina.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.780]   It occurred to me on the drive over,
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.460]   like peer pressure is just not something that impacts you.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.540]   You're not gonna do something
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.260]   because people around you are doing it.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.620]   - Well, no, you're absolutely right.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.900]   I always felt this sense of uniqueness or whatever,
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.500]   but I became very humble because of it.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.340]   I'm not arrogant.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.500]   It's not that I feel that others are worse and so on.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.820]   But yes, when I came to the United States,
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.220]   there was something, there was a decision I had to make,
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.500]   which is, I remember explicitly thinking about.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.620]   It was the first time that I was beyond the control
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.500]   of my parents and family and the social environment
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.780]   in which I was in Argentina.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.500]   So you could do whatever you wanted.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.140]   And I was not the only one who came.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.060]   There were three or four brilliant mathematicians
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.580]   and physicists that came with me.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.700]   And I saw them, within a year, just losing it all.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   They never, one of them never graduated.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.700]   They got into drugs.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.660]   They got, they moved to the village in New York,
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.300]   and they decided that that was the life
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   they wanted to have.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.020]   Problem is that 10 years on, what are you doing, right?
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.300]   I mean, being, getting to be an old hippie
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.140]   is not that interesting.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.900]   So I really had that notion at that time
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.220]   that I needed to be very disciplined.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.180]   And I had to internalize a set of values
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.060]   and to ask myself what I want and what I don't want.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.740]   And so, yes, indeed, I used to go to parties.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.940]   To me, it was quite a surprise.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.020]   In New York, Philadelphia, people smoking pot
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.100]   and all sorts of other incredible things,
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.060]   getting drunk and so on.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.580]   It was something that I would say, "No, thank you."
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.420]   And that was it.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.820]   And I felt quite okay with it.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.980]   And I never felt the need to satisfy a group of people
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.180]   that were like this in order to be included.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.820]   - You know, there's only one person
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.700]   that I've ever met in my entire life, now that I'm 49,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.860]   I can say things like now that I'm 49,
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.340]   who has never been drunk, never done drugs,
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.780]   basically has never really had a sip of alcohol
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.700]   except for once, and that's Rick Rubin,
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.460]   my good friend who's- - I like the meaning.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.940]   - Yeah, by all standards is probably
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.700]   the greatest music producer of all time
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.140]   across a dozen different genres, right?
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.780]   Not just rock and roll, but classical, country, all this.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.620]   And I once asked Rick, you worked in music
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.660]   where drugs and alcohol are everywhere,
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.980]   or at least used to be.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.860]   And he just said, "Yeah, it never really interested me.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.940]   "I could be around it, but not participate in it."
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.140]   And so, the two of you are the only people I know
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.700]   that have ever had that kind of relationship
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.100]   to what's going on around you,
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.140]   where you don't feel pulled into it.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.060]   - I also didn't understand, I mean, for instance,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.700]   the role of drugs and alcohol in young people,
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.140]   I was a graduate student, to a large extent,
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.980]   plays a role of relaxation and, you know,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.940]   getting rid of stress and anxiety and so on.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.220]   To me, it was very interesting
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.380]   that people would actually come sometimes to my place
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.780]   and ask, you know, do you have something to smoke or,
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.460]   why? Because I'm nervous or whatever.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.020]   Well, you know, deal with your state of anxiety,
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.540]   but you don't have to drink to do that.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.900]   And I was always a little bit also concerned about my brain.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.100]   I mean, I was afraid that these things
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.980]   would just take me over the edge, off the rails.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.700]   So, I just, but I think I was also, I need to say this,
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.660]   I was also rather judgmental of people
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.500]   who did it at that time.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.900]   And it was a way, by being judgmental,
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.500]   by saying this is wrong,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.940]   then I was able to stay on my track, okay?
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.380]   Today, I'm much more understanding.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.340]   I mean, I hear people and that's what, you know,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.180]   it works for them.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.700]   It's fine, although I still don't like it.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.580]   And it was even worse when we came to California
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.540]   because that here, everything was going on,
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.300]   not just drugs and everything else.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.140]   So-
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   - Well, let's talk about that,
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.460]   but not that specifically right off the bat.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.340]   So, you finished your PhD.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.180]   - Yeah.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.140]   - You could have become, done a postdoc, become a professor.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.100]   - I was playing with that.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.940]   I was playing with that.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.940]   I wanted to go to, my dream was to go to Cambridge University
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.660]   in England, not only because the Cavendish Laboratory
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.140]   was fantastic, there was the whole thing on DNA.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.940]   I mean, Crick was there and so on.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.940]   So, I thought that perhaps I would just start, you know,
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.420]   inhaling some of those vapors.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.700]   - You wanted to get into biology.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.980]   - Well, I was interested.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.540]   I mean, because I'd read the famous book by Watson,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.700]   you know, "The Double Helix," and I couldn't sleep.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.940]   I mean, I read it one night and I said,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.140]   "It's incredible what this guy did."
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.980]   - Amazing book.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.860]   - Amazing book, yes.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.060]   So, I said, oh, the whole thing is becoming like physics.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.580]   It's no longer all these complicated names and so on.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.940]   - Well, it's crystallography, which is, you know,
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.900]   I mean, the physics and chemistry are so--
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.580]   - Crystallography is boring because you have,
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.420]   it's like botany.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.820]   You have to learn all these crystals.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.980]   - I'm just chuckling because the spaghetti model folks,
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.500]   as we call them, the crystallographers,
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.380]   are probably covering their eyes right now,
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.180]   but that's all right.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.420]   They love what they do and thank goodness for them.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.260]   - No, no, of course.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.580]   - 'Cause they design novel drug pockets and receptors.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.420]   I mean, they're doing some cool stuff.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   - So, I thought that being at Cambridge was okay.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.140]   I mean, you would suffer from, you know,
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.420]   not even heating in the rooms and so on.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.380]   But then what happens was, I mean, you know,
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.140]   I met your mother and then, you know,
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.820]   she brought a little bit of reality into my life
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.660]   and said, you know--
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.500]   - How so?
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.060]   - Well, she said, you know, it's time for you to graduate.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.540]   Time, because I was just staying there as a, you know,
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.860]   a PhD student, you know, I was fine, you know.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.220]   Okay, the money was a problem,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.260]   but, you know, I got to live like this.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.460]   - You met mom in New York.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.020]   - I met your mother in New York, yes.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.900]   And she was, she had her, you know, feet on the ground
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.500]   and said, you know, it's time for you to graduate and so on.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.380]   And then she actually was right.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.780]   And so, I decided to look for a job,
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.100]   and my professor wasn't necessarily letting me go.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.780]   He wanted me to stay as a postdoc with him, which, you know.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.660]   - This is something people don't often understand,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.500]   is that if a student or postdoc is very good,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.300]   the advisors are de-incentivized
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.020]   to move them along to their job.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.860]   - Right.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.700]   - But it's a tricky game
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.020]   because you want the support of your advisor,
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.140]   but oftentimes your advisor, if you're very good,
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:47.980]   they want to keep you.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.820]   - Yes.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.100]   So, there was also another aspect at that time.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.820]   By then, I started thinking that I wanted to live
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.340]   a much more comfortable life.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.940]   I mean, I come from a family
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.580]   that lived a very comfortable life,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.420]   and I wanted that very badly.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   And so, I started, you know, looking for jobs and so on.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.540]   My advisor was not too keen to, you know,
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.780]   tell me what to do.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.740]   So, instead of going,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.140]   I could have gone for a postdoc to a couple of places,
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.300]   but I wanted to be a little more independent.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.420]   And I discovered that there were research institutions
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.540]   like IBM and Xerox in the West Coast and so on.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.380]   There were, you know,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.300]   people could do science, you know, good science.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.260]   And, you know, Bell Labs was the most famous one of all.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.220]   - That was on the East Coast.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.060]   - In the East Coast.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.500]   I went to Bell Labs for an interview,
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.900]   and I felt that they were running that
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.540]   like a Russian internment camp almost.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.460]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.500]   You were, they were, we were 10 of us,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.180]   and, you know, they took us around
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.220]   and people were taking notes of what you were saying
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.300]   and asking and so on,
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.980]   telling us that was an elite place.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:43.820]   It was an elite place.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.940]   - So, East Coast.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.860]   - East Coast institutions.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.100]   I mean, it makes sense to me now
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.260]   why having been raised in the Bay Area
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.340]   that East Coast institutions and I
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.460]   are just never gonna mix
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.460]   because there's, they love tradition,
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.420]   they love hierarchy, and they love history.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.580]   Whereas on the West Coast,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.700]   well, it's all about the startup, the IPO,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.460]   what is about what happened in the last three years
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.180]   and what's gonna happen in the next 10 years.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.380]   - Right, well, on the other hand,
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.020]   there is something nice to be said
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.180]   about the European model of universities in the sense that,
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.700]   the biggest contrast, you say this,
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.500]   I remember, I, you know, when you gave,
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.620]   when professors gave this colloquium and so on,
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.020]   they were wearing a suit and tie
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.060]   at the University of Pennsylvania,
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.380]   an Ivy League school and so on.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.700]   I came to Stanford.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.020]   I went to the first colloquium
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.180]   and the students were coming in shorts
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.180]   with their dogs into the auditorium.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.460]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.500]   I mean, it was, it was such an incredible,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.580]   you know, change, cultural change.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.780]   - Yeah, but smart, but smart, I mean.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.580]   - Oh, incredibly smart, incredibly smart.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.780]   They know that about that.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.180]   So, in any event, I discovered something
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.180]   which historically became incredibly important,
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.740]   although I was marginally involved in it,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.900]   which was Xerox Corporation had invented a copier,
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.180]   decided that they were gonna get into the information age,
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.580]   and they decided to establish a new research center
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.140]   in Palo Alto, next to Stanford,
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.340]   where they would recruit people
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.940]   that would work on this whole thing,
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.020]   computers and information and physics and so on.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.860]   And I came in and the guys, you know,
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.180]   whoever interviewed me, they said,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.620]   "Oh, this is exactly the place for you."
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.940]   So, that's what I did.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.980]   And the interesting thing was that while I was there doing
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.300]   what I thought was interesting things,
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.540]   there was a whole group of people, very small,
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.700]   that invented the personal computer.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.620]   Steve Jobs saw it and built the first Mac out of it.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.060]   - This was, I had a classmate in high school,
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.140]   Becca Canara.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:30.980]   - Yes.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.660]   - I remember, 'cause she wrote a Vespa to school.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.500]   - Yeah, her mother was involved in that.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.020]   - And her mom was involved in creating the,
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.900]   it was Adele.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.740]   - Adele, yes.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.820]   - Adele Goldberg.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.580]   - Adele Goldberg in developing the ability to move
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.340]   what appear to be pages on the screen.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.660]   - Object-oriented languages.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.180]   I had no idea that was going on, I'll be honest with you.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.100]   I mean, it was going on the second floor.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.340]   They were all hippie-like.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.620]   I mean, it was a scandal of the life that they had there.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.860]   It was the '70s and still the Bay Area was not what it's now.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.140]   I mean, everybody went to risottis, you know,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.420]   take long lunches and there was a lot of stuff
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.780]   on drugs and so on.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.180]   - Yeah, can I ask a question about that?
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.660]   So Xerox PARC was this incredible place.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.100]   I remember going there when I was a kid to your lab.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.300]   Actually, one of my earliest recollections was
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   you took me into your and Jim Boyce's experimental lab.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.980]   You told me to pick a piece of fruit.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.060]   There was a bowl of fruit.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.460]   I picked a banana.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.980]   You took the banana, you peeled it,
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.060]   and you dipped it into liquid nitrogen.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.620]   And then you told me to throw it on the ground
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.140]   and we shattered the banana.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.480]   And I thought that was like the coolest thing ever.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.320]   I remember that.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.080]   That was happening, but you mentioned the stuff
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.360]   that was happening about developing computer interfaces
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   and that indeed Jobs borrowed or stole
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.280]   mostly because PARC didn't protect
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.560]   the intellectual property well.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.800]   I mean, he didn't do it illegally.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.080]   I mean, he sought, they basically gave it away.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:55.920]   - Right, right.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:56.740]   - They basically gave it away, right?
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.340]   - Xerox was thinking that, you know,
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.200]   copiers were their future and that's it.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.620]   - But I also recall, 'cause I overheard the conversations
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.640]   between you and mom when I was a kid, perhaps,
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.160]   that there were, it was pretty wild at PARC.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.000]   Like there was this whole, like the room with the beanbags,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.280]   people were taking LSD and other drugs.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.320]   That wasn't your scene though.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.600]   - No, no, no, not at all.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.720]   I was in the physics lab and we can talk later
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.880]   a little bit about it with Gene Boyce,
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.080]   who was a very, very interesting collaborator of mine
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.920]   and so on.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.880]   We had a lot of fun, but not on that level.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   As a matter of fact, we were considered very square people,
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.240]   you know, doing what we were doing.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.680]   I mean, this is a group of people that were truly the,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.960]   I mean, books have been written on this whole class
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.680]   of people that became really the embryo
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.880]   of what Silicon Valley became.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.480]   There were brilliant people trying to do new things,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.720]   Adele, Alan Kay.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.560]   There were many of them.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   - Did you ever want to get involved in that stuff?
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.760]   - I used to see them as so,
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.780]   yeah, I'll tell you how I got involved.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.280]   The head of the group, Bob Taylor, a very charismatic man
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.920]   who was responsible for the development
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.640]   of the personal computing.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.680]   He was the head of the computer science lab.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.480]   He once heard that I played ping pong.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.400]   So he started challenging me to ping pong.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.380]   So we used to play ping pong, you know,
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.320]   and the conversations were so odd
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.800]   because I would say, oh, you do computer science.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.440]   I have some mathematical problems.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.520]   I would like some guys in your lab to help me.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.360]   He said, we are not the kind of computer scientists
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.800]   you imagine, like at IBM with a white coat,
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.920]   fixing machines and solving math.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.360]   We want to revolutionize the world.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.000]   We want to change the way you think.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.520]   He used to say that to me.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.120]   And I sort of understood a little bit of it,
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.160]   but quite frankly, it seemed totally out
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.600]   of whatever I was doing.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.620]   - This is what when Mark Andreessen,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.620]   founder of Netscape, et cetera, A16Z,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.660]   now when he was sitting in the very seat you're sitting in,
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.540]   here he described this notion of wild ducks
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.100]   that at companies you have these people
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.100]   that are small groups of people
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.660]   that are really kind of wild and outrageous
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.420]   and really testing the outer limits of what's possible.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.900]   Do you think they serve an important role?
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.740]   - Tremendous, tremendous.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.820]   And I was a little bit of that in my field at that time.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.340]   I was the first one to realize
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.340]   that once I saw these machines,
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.700]   I could use them for doing things
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.680]   even in physics that no one could do.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.580]   And the kinds of fields that I chose to work on
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:11.140]   were totally out of what people were doing
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.420]   at Xerox or IBM and so on.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.920]   I think that these people are essential.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.260]   Now, the question is what does a company or a university,
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.100]   what do they do with those ideas and so on?
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.020]   Xerox lost it completely.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.260]   I mean, they showed them the stuff
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.700]   and there's a whole books that have been written about it.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.700]   - Well, one thing that I think I'm realizing now
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.780]   I inherited from you consciously or unconsciously
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:38.180]   is that, well, I've been more of a risk taker
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.500]   with various aspects of my life
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.040]   than I probably should have been,
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   but that I've always enjoyed being near people
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.460]   who are really pushing the boundary on something.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.300]   Like my love of like skateboarding,
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.260]   but not just skateboarding,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.340]   but our friend Danny Wade jumping the Great Wall of China,
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.900]   building mega ramps in his yard.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.700]   I knew I wasn't gonna do that,
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.860]   but there's something about being adjacent
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.420]   to people like that,
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.540]   that changes the way that I've approached things
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:10.540]   that were more pedestrian to make them less pedestrian.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.260]   And maybe we'll return to this
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.460]   because I think that being around people
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.340]   who are real mavericks and real iconoclasts
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.500]   can be very beneficial,
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.780]   but it doesn't mean that you have to jump in
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.060]   and do what they're doing.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.500]   - Well, I decided at one point to take huge risks.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.500]   And as a matter of fact,
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.300]   my first piece of work after I got my job at Xerox PARC,
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.260]   which was supposed to work
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.740]   on some solid state physics or whatever,
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.100]   was I had this notion,
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.740]   this fantasy of Einstein in the patent office.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.860]   So I would start working on things that were crazy.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.100]   And there's a whole notion in physics,
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.620]   which is called tachyons,
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.260]   particles that are faster than the speed of light.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.100]   - How do you say it?
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.940]   - Tachyons.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.760]   - Tachyons.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.600]   - It's from the word tachyons,
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.860]   which means fast, swift,
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.060]   means particles that are faster than the speed of light,
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.220]   which is impossible.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.820]   But some physicists were playing with that idea, okay?
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.660]   And I became very interested in that.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.500]   As a matter of fact,
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.420]   my first paper out of graduate school was on tachyons,
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.300]   and I had the pride of getting the paper accepted
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.700]   in the top physics journal.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.180]   - It's physics review letters?
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.700]   - Physics letters, yes.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.820]   Yeah, and I remember my cousin Hector
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   sending me a note or something saying,
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.740]   "Well, now I see the road to perdition," he said.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.140]   But I was so proud of it.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.420]   I really thought that I was doing something incredible,
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.100]   and it had nothing to do with the work
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.420]   I was doing on a daily basis.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.180]   And I published several papers
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.740]   on things that were very important to me.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.820]   - You have a lot of single author papers.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.660]   - Yes, yes.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.420]   - This is something that is especially rare in biology,
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.500]   but you have a lot of single author papers.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I was very proud of that.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.220]   Yes, yes.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.380]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.940]   and thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.180]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.380]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.460]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.780]   in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.340]   We should all know that proper hydration
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.780]   is critical for optimal brain and body function.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.940]   In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.340]   can diminish your cognitive and physical performance
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.740]   to a considerable degree.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.660]   It's also important that you're not just hydrated,
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.740]   but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.020]   in the right ratios.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.380]   Drinking a packet of Element dissolved in water
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.740]   makes it very easy to ensure
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.820]   that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.100]   and electrolytes.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.380]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both,
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.980]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.980]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.260]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.940]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.100]   I'll also drink a packet of Element dissolved in water
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.540]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.620]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.860]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.740]   There are a bunch of different
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.180]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.940]   I like the watermelon, I like the raspberry,
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.780]   I like the citrus.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.180]   Basically, I like all of them.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.340]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.540]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.040]   to claim an Element sample pack
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.260]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.020]   Again, that's drinkelement spelled L-M-N-T.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.040]   So it's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.860]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by ExpressVPN.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.980]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.220]   that keeps your data secure and private.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.740]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.480]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.700]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.900]   Now, I'm familiar with the effects
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.820]   of not securing my data well enough.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.420]   Several years ago, I had one of my bank accounts hacked,
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.300]   and it was a terrible amount of work
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.980]   to have that reversed and for the account to be secured.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.820]   When that happened,
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.540]   I talked to my friends in the tech community,
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.620]   and what they told me was that
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.180]   even though you think your internet connection
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.380]   may be secure, oftentimes it's not,
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.340]   especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.460]   such as those on planes, in hotels,
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:44.860]   at coffee shops, and other public places.
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.460]   Surprisingly, even at home,
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.500]   your data might not be as secure as you think.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.940]   To make sure that what I described before
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.480]   would never happen to me again,
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.780]   I started using ExpressVPN.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.420]   The great thing about ExpressVPN
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.380]   is that I don't even notice that it's running,
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.600]   since the connection it provides is so fast.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.940]   I have it on my computer and on my phone,
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.300]   and I keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.020]   With ExpressVPN, I know everything is secure,
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.540]   my web browsing, all my passwords, all my data,
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.940]   and of course, anything that's behind an account wall,
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.860]   like a bank account.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.700]   It can't be tracked,
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.580]   and no one can access or steal your data,
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.500]   which is terrific.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.620]   If you'd like to start protecting your internet activity
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:19.940]   using ExpressVPN,
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:23.260]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman,
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.380]   and you can get an extra three months free.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.380]   Again, that's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/huberman
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.700]   to get an extra three months free.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.300]   - Can I ask you a question, as a slight departure,
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.880]   but as something I've always wanted to ask you,
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.460]   and feel free to say no if it's not
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.300]   like something that could be done in a couple of minutes.
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.380]   So many people hear Einstein's name,
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.980]   they think of the hair, they think of relativity.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:54.620]   Is it possible to explain relativity in a way
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:58.900]   that the everyday person can get it a little bit better
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.660]   than they perhaps understand it now?
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.300]   - Yes, I think, as a matter of fact,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.220]   I learned not long ago that Einstein himself
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.020]   wrote a popular book on relativity
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.300]   that seems to be very, very accessible.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.740]   Okay, now, there are two aspects to relativity.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.680]   I mean, there are two things that our brains
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.260]   were not made by evolution to understand intuitively.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.380]   One is relativity, and the other one is quantum physics.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.940]   We know, we have intuitions, like, you know,
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.900]   an animal, for instance, if you see a lion
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.660]   running after a zebra and so on,
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.220]   the lion can actually calculate intuitively,
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.700]   you know, the speed at which it can move and so on.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.840]   We can do the same.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.460]   But if you start thinking about what happens
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.260]   when you get too near the speed of light,
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.260]   we have no intuition whatsoever.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.100]   Time almost stops.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.120]   There are all sorts of complicated things.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.080]   Lengths contract.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.920]   I mean, it's a very complicated set of things,
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.800]   and that's why it's very hard to understand,
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.420]   although the math works.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.680]   Then there is general relativity that is even worse
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.040]   because there is some kind of a warping of space-time
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.140]   that is responsible for gravitation.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.160]   But I'll go into that in a second.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.760]   The other one is quantum physics.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   Our brains are not, not only are they not wired
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.480]   to understand that near the speed of light,
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   because no one moves near the speed of light.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.120]   I mean, we move at speeds that are fairly small
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.760]   compared to the speed of light.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.960]   And quantum mechanics is at such a microscopic level
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.280]   that is below, basically, the level of a molecule.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.680]   It's molecules, atoms, and inside the atom.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.200]   So, it's very, very hard to visualize
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.920]   or even understand some of the very counterintuitive ideas
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.160]   like entanglement and also, you know.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.200]   So, relativity can be understood
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.960]   in the sense that you can explain certain things,
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.980]   but people say, "Well, how can quantum work like that?"
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.760]   And then you have to get into the math.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.600]   Okay.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.200]   But I think that, I took a course a few years ago
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.600]   on generativity and I just--
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.440]   - Is it profound?
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.680]   I wanted to learn it finally.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.920]   It's profound, deep.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:56.800]   And it makes you feel that this man, Einstein,
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.320]   he had help from a lot of people,
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.880]   but still, it's an incredible thing.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.880]   I mean, you know, it's on a level of Beethoven's symphonies
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.660]   and Mozart's piano concertos.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.640]   I mean, it's something that comes into your head
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.840]   and you're able to do, you know, through a lot of struggle.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.360]   I mean, it took him years to do that.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.320]   Okay, so, but it's profound.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.080]   Now, when you say, "Can you explain?"
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.400]   I mean, the point is Einstein one day discovered
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.960]   that if the speed of light is the speed of light,
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.840]   no matter how fast you move with respect
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.680]   to a beam of light,
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.240]   it's still moving at the speed of light.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.320]   That means that the notion of simultaneity
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.360]   between two events is relative now.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.920]   So, you and I might say, "Yes, now it's 110,
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.720]   "but if you're moving very fast with respect to me,
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.240]   "instead of 110, you'll say something else," okay?
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.080]   Just because time for you and I are not synchronized.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.360]   And that leads to all sorts of very interesting effects,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.240]   and practical effects, too,
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.720]   because from there comes the idea
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.480]   that mass and energy are the same.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.880]   From there, nuclear weapons came out of that.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.600]   All sorts of very interesting things, you know,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.840]   and today, you know, we can even detect gravitational waves
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.440]   that are coming from almost the beginning of the universe.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.960]   We can detect that because of those theories.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.440]   They can calculate.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.680]   So, it's profound, yes.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.760]   I mean, Einstein, I think, stands on,
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.200]   I mean, Newton, too, by the way.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.960]   I mean, you know, Newton, Einstein,
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.280]   I think they're top people, you know.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.720]   But they talk to God, in a way, as they say. (laughs)
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.560]   - We'll get back to God a little bit later.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.160]   Yeah, it seems to me that
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.920]   even though it's very hard to grasp,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.160]   it's worth asking for those of us
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.640]   that don't have an intuitive sense of relativity theory
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   that is starting to, you know,
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.120]   peer into these things a little bit,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   trying to understand them.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.000]   Do you think that it gives one's mind an ability
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.200]   to, you know, to tap into forms of cognition
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.680]   that we don't normally think about
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.480]   when we're looking at macromechanics of the world around us,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.040]   that objects fall down, not up,
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.760]   and, you know, a helium balloon goes up, okay,
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.920]   and you can learn something about helium.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.800]   But it's all pretty straightforward
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.360]   with just a few simple bullet points,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.600]   whereas when you get into quantum mechanics,
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.560]   yeah, it challenges the mind in a way
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.840]   that it really feels like, for most people, there's a cliff,
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.200]   and we just kind of go, okay, you know.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.160]   And obviously, there's trust there,
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.440]   but for people that are curious about understanding
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.280]   how the really tiny bits of the physical universe
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.440]   link up with the really big bits of the physical universe,
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.880]   where's the best place to start?
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   - Well, okay, you're asking a very, very interesting question
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.720]   which is, for most of us who are trained in physics,
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.600]   we learn how to calculate,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.560]   we learn how to operate with these things.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.640]   I, you know, I just got a patent on using quantum mechanics
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.560]   for communication and so on,
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.960]   but it's still the puzzle is,
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.360]   why does it work the way it works?
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.480]   So what I'm saying is you learn an operational way
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.840]   of doing these things operationally.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.400]   I don't know what happens in your brain
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.920]   because I have ideas that come out of intuitions,
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.360]   not just formulas and equations,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.960]   and yet I don't necessarily think I understand deeply
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.520]   why these things are the way they are.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.800]   They are where they are,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.920]   and there's no reason why they shouldn't be like that.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.200]   Our brains, as I said before, you know,
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.400]   they are essentially conformed
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.000]   to understand the macroscopic world,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.480]   not high speeds and so on.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.920]   So physicists work in general activity.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.760]   I don't.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.160]   Can do incredible calculations.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.360]   Can you tell you what a black hole collapsing
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.600]   to another black hole would do?
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.560]   And, you know, they're using general activity things,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.320]   and so they can do it.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.120]   Now, what it does to your brain
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.080]   that allows you to operationally work with these equations
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.640]   and solve it and have new ideas,
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.040]   it's something I don't understand.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.440]   Namely, for instance, the example that I gave
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.640]   about quantum mechanics, that's a very simple one
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.360]   because I talk to a lot of people nowadays
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.560]   that work on this, is I can give you two dice, okay?
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.240]   You know, just dice.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.560]   You can go to Mars and I stay here.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.960]   The dice are, let's assume
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.840]   they're quantum mechanically entangled.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.720]   I throw my dice.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.560]   I see three.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.840]   You got three.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.000]   And we don't communicate.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.040]   They're entangled.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.120]   They go, this is faster than the speed of light.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.000]   I throw again, five.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.840]   You get five.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.680]   I do one.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.520]   You get one.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.360]   And it's an amazing thing.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.240]   - What is the origin of the entanglement?
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.160]   - It's a property of quantum systems
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.680]   that they can get entangled.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.800]   That's the word.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.840]   And somehow what happens to your system affects mine,
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.280]   but doesn't affect it in the sense of signal.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.160]   No signal.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.440]   They're entangled.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.320]   Now, let me, let me, now, this becomes rather--
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.040]   - They're not entangled through other bits of the universe.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:30.880]   - No, no.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   - They're totally independent.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.680]   - Totally independent, yes.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.720]   They are entangled in the sense
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.800]   that quantum mechanically they started like this.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.040]   Now, there are ways, I mean, they're trivial things.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.280]   There's a famous example of the socks.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.640]   Okay, so you take a trip and you took a pair of socks.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.560]   Let's assume they're blue socks and so on.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.800]   And then you open your bag and you,
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.240]   oh, I forgot one sock.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.520]   So this is my blue sock.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.640]   So you know that there is a blue sock at home.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.360]   So knowing that is a correlation,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.560]   but that's trivial, right?
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.200]   I mean, you can do that with anything.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.280]   In quantum mechanics, imagine that you look at a sock,
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.680]   but the sock is changing colors all the time.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.160]   So now you observe it is red.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.000]   The other one is red.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.880]   I observe it is green.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.280]   The other one is green.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280]   Okay, randomly.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.600]   - So little bits of the universe are entangled.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.960]   - Well, some people, and a friend of mine
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   who's a Buddhist claims that there is a whole religious
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.480]   or Buddhist who are saying that everything was entangled.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.600]   Yes, originally all atoms, all electrons,
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.800]   all elementary particles were entangled, yes.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.560]   Because the universe started very, very tiny
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.120]   and everything was entangled.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.160]   Okay, so you could imagine that the universe is entangled.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.080]   So what happens here affects the other.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.680]   But it gets, the entanglement gets lost
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.320]   when perturbations and noise appears and so on.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.800]   So we are not today entangled with, I don't know.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.120]   I mean, we don't think that we are.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:42.960]   - Some people think that.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.800]   - Yes, yes.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.640]   - Some people are entangled.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.480]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.320]   - Well, that gets to it.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.480]   - But that's a whole, yeah.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.320]   - That's a whole thing.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.640]   - Yeah, that's poetry.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.040]   - That's poetry, exactly.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.560]   There's another example that brings us
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.760]   to a very salient aspect of my childhood,
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.600]   which is chaos theory.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.440]   - Okay, yes.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.360]   - Right, so I'll say it so you don't have to.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.680]   You're one of the founders of chaos
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.760]   or certain aspects of chaos theory.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.840]   We'll talk about that.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.880]   But for those of us that grew up in the '80s and '90s,
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   I was born in '75, who saw the movie "Jurassic Park."
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.600]   There's a moment in that movie
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.280]   where I think Jeff Goldblum is explaining,
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.480]   what is it, chaos theory.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.440]   And maybe it was the butterfly flapping its wings
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.040]   in one location and impacting something someplace else.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.400]   For the poets in the world, right,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.680]   that was a very captivating example
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.840]   because I think the human brain can naturally understand
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.960]   that things around us, we can have an impact on them
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.160]   and they can have an impact on us.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.120]   But that the notion that a small insect,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.000]   thousands of kilometers away can impact something
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.160]   that's going on more adjacent to us,
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.360]   it seems outrageous, sci-fi.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.640]   But the notion that one thing impacts another
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.680]   and impacts another, that's pretty straightforward, right?
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:11.040]   There's just a dominoing of the physical world.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.320]   Chaos theory is different.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.160]   - Yes.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.720]   - Okay, could you explain chaos?
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.560]   - Yes.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.720]   - And I'll just add one more thing just for context
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.280]   for you to sort of the paints in the palette.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.680]   Around the same time, I remember the book "Chaos"
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.440]   coming out and where there was a lot of excitement
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.680]   around chaos and this was coming up.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.960]   There was also a lot of discussion about fractals.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.600]   The idea that when you zoom into things
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.240]   at a very, very small level,
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.800]   you start seeing some regularities.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.560]   Now we know this about crystal structures, right?
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.800]   Like go drop a water under a high-powered microscope,
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.080]   you'll see structure there.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.040]   It's not random.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.040]   The angles are very consistent,
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.120]   at least around certain nodes, et cetera.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.160]   So I think people love this idea
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.160]   that we have repeating patterns and numbers in nature,
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.080]   that things at a distance can impact us more closely.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.120]   Like this is the kind of stuff
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.640]   that the non-physics brain can understand.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.480]   - Yes.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.320]   - And it does enchant, right?
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.560]   We sort of poked at poetry.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.400]   I love poetry, you love poetry.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.720]   But I think it enchants
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.320]   because I think humans are naturally interested
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.560]   in how the randomness of life
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.600]   might not be as random as it appears.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.480]   So what is chaos?
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.080]   Where does it exist in our lives?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.280]   Not emotional chaos,
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.760]   but and what is the relationship
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.960]   between fractals and chaos, if any?
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.160]   - Okay, let me say, first of all,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.000]   about why chaos is what it is.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.840]   And it's not quantum.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.920]   And there is quantum stories
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.360]   and there's a quantum chaotic field,
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.800]   but I won't go into that.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.000]   Chaos is a very interesting idea,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.640]   which it flies against our intuitions.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.200]   Since the times of Newton,
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.360]   we know that if you give me the position
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.120]   and the velocity of initial particle,
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.240]   I can use Newton's equations of motion
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.960]   to tell you where that particle is gonna be anywhere
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.200]   with an incredible precision.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.160]   When we launch a rocket,
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.640]   we wanna go to the moon,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.760]   we can calculate and predict exactly
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.840]   where the rocket is gonna be after so many hours,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.240]   after so many days and so on.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.240]   Actually, we use the equations of motion
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.480]   to predict that trajectory.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.280]   And it's a precise trajectory.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.360]   - This is how Elon was able to capture the rocket
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.280]   with the chopsticks recently.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.200]   - Something of that sort.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.840]   Yeah, that's, yeah.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.640]   Okay, now, the idea of chaos is,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.560]   so that's, okay, it works.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.400]   There are some cases where, let's assume,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.680]   now I'm gonna give you a simple example.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.400]   So I take a ball, I put it on a billiard ball,
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.960]   on a billiard table.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.160]   I send it out.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.520]   And at the moment I can know exactly
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.480]   the position of velocity,
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.640]   I can tell you exactly where it's gonna go.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.400]   Chaos says that a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny difference
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.200]   in the initial position or velocity of that ball
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.520]   will take it very, very far from the other one,
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.720]   which is ridiculous.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.360]   I mean, if I tell you that, you know,
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.120]   two cars start at exactly the same speed
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.160]   in the same position and one of them has a little more,
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.400]   you know, they'll stay parallel to each other.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.080]   In some systems, and I'll tell you in a second,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.760]   that actually, those two trajectories diverge completely.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.240]   So it's what we call sensitivity to initial conditions.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.800]   Okay, that's what chaos is all about in classical mechanics.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.000]   What is really weird about it
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   is that it happens in systems that also undergo friction.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.640]   Because let me give you an example that I used to,
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.120]   you know, I used to teach chaos at Stanford for many years.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.400]   So imagine I give you a beaker full of molasses.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.120]   And you take a very big ball, stainless steel ball,
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.720]   and you just throw it into the thing.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Well, after a while, it will just drift
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.800]   with it and it goes so slow because, you know,
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.680]   friction slows it down and it just goes.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.760]   And now you throw another one from another altitude
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.560]   and all of them are gonna do exactly the same.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.280]   Some systems that are chaotic do exactly the opposite.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.400]   Even though there is friction,
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.280]   everything tends to just slow it down,
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.520]   they just keep going far apart from each other.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.080]   Amazing.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:00.960]   Amazing thing.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.200]   So that's chaos, okay?
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.280]   And I can tell you a little bit
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.920]   why I got so involved in this and the work we did.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.400]   - Does chaos exist in every physical system?
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.960]   - Mostly, yes, yes.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.600]   - Maybe even in neurons or the brain.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.680]   - Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.200]   I mean, this is why I don't wanna get into controversy here
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.800]   about issues of whether we live deterministic lives or not.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.560]   But, you know, if things are a little bit random and so on,
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.000]   or even just a tiny difference in initial conditions
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.400]   can take you to very different outcomes.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.200]   But this, we're not talking about many particles,
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.440]   we are talking two.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.680]   Okay, so that's one.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.600]   Now, fractals is a different story
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.440]   that comes out of a guy who I knew very well,
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.760]   Benoit Mandelbrot, a very, very, very funny character.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.240]   Brilliant, too, but very strange.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.720]   Who discovered that certain things are self-similar.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.280]   That if you look at the coast of Britain,
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.440]   he used to say that.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.880]   You look at the coast of Britain and you say,
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.480]   "Okay, tell me, how long is the coast of Britain?"
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.400]   You go with a meter and you measure it.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.760]   Now, suppose that the meter that you're using now
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.160]   can measure up to an inch.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.800]   Well, you're gonna get a different distance,
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.240]   even though you are adding the same.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.320]   Because there are all these little things
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.000]   in the coast of Britain that are essentially self-similar
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.360]   that add a tremendous amount of length.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.120]   That's what a fractal is all about.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.640]   These are structures that are not just a simple line,
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.120]   but they have all these other things, okay?
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.000]   He thought that it was a whole new geometry.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.760]   As a matter of fact, and I tell you this
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.600]   because I knew Benoit very well,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.640]   I met him through a talk that I gave on chaos.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.320]   He used to hang out with chaos physicists.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.080]   He was a mathematician, brilliant man in many ways.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.360]   I was having dinner with him in Copenhagen in a restaurant.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.080]   And then the very pretty waitress came to us and so on
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.040]   and served us, and we were talking, he's a Frenchman,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.760]   he spoke with a very heavy French accent,
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.240]   and so she says something, "What are you doing here?"
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.880]   He says, "We're at a conference."
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.720]   "But I'm not just at a conference.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.440]   "I'm a very special man," he said to her.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.400]   And she said, "How come?"
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.640]   And he says, "Do you know who Euclid was?"
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.920]   And she says, "Sort of."
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.200]   She said, "Well, he was a Greek man who invented geometry."
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.960]   And he said, "Oh, well, guess what?
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.600]   "I am better than Euclid.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.160]   "I invented a different geometry."
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.880]   - He said that? - Yeah, he said that.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.720]   - Points to the waitress in Denmark that knew about Euclid.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.200]   - That was very smart. - The Danes are smart.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.120]   - Yeah, yeah, okay, that was very funny
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.080]   that he would talk about it.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.240]   So he would give a talk, and he would say,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.240]   "My equations can generate anything."
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.040]   Indeed, he could generate any patterns.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.400]   So he would say, "You want a mountain?
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.040]   "Here goes a mountain, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.640]   "and you see a mountain, beautiful graphs," and so on.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.520]   So self-similarity is a very powerful idea in physics
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.440]   because it allows you that if you know something
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.240]   at a certain scale, you can predict what it's gonna be
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.400]   at a different other scales, and I use that.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.520]   But chaos and fractals are not always the same.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.200]   As he used to say, because he didn't like physicists,
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.240]   because we never liked his talks, we always said,
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.800]   "Okay, so you're telling us that, you know, things are..."
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.800]   He used to say, "I'm not interested in pulleys.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.360]   "I'm not interested in things that move things up and down,"
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.200]   he used to say.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.880]   - He was thinking about elementary physics class.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.840]   - Something of that sort, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.080]   But fractals are very interesting
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.880]   because these are self-similar structures.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.680]   At all levels, they look the same.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.280]   You look at it big, you look at small,
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.720]   they have the same type of geometric behavior.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.440]   Chaos is all about dynamics, how things evolve in time, okay?
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.000]   And chaotic systems, they tend to diverge
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.920]   from each other for a long, long time.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.200]   The man who invented the idea of the butterfly effect
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.880]   was a man called Ed Lorenz,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.040]   who was a very famous meteorologist at MIT,
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.960]   and he was solving the equations of the atmosphere,
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.000]   trying to predict the behavior of the weather.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.200]   And he noticed, in these very old computers and so on,
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.440]   that sometimes he would get different behaviors.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.800]   He thought there was something wrong about the computer,
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.720]   and he discovered that the only thing that was wrong
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.000]   was that the initial conditions that he was giving them
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.960]   was very tinily different,
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.480]   and he would get different things.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.120]   From there, he went into that.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.120]   And there's a very beautiful,
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.840]   I mean, there are ideas that are very beautiful,
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.440]   like strange attractors and so on.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.240]   I mean, we don't have to go into that.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.520]   So chaos is really a field that essentially explains
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.320]   why things that seem to be simply explained
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.680]   by classical physics tend to diverge from each other,
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.760]   and they give rise to random outcomes.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   That's the important thing.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.240]   You can use chaos in order to generate random numbers.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.520]   You can use chaos to generate random patterns.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.360]   I've done that.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.920]   - And chaos exists at the quantum level and the macro level?
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.000]   - Okay, so I was working on something,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.080]   and I don't think it's interesting how I got into this,
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.160]   because I was doing something else,
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.760]   and suddenly I decided I was gonna do this,
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.080]   and I really started going very fast at this.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.880]   But then I had a very bright student that you met, Ted Hoag,
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.320]   and we decided, let's see if we can see chaos
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.840]   in quantum mechanics.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.360]   And we started doing it, and there were a couple of papers
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.680]   by the Russians actually showing that this was the case,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.920]   and we discovered that it was not the case.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.040]   We actually proved that quantum systems are not chaotic.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.840]   There's some kind of interference between them and so on
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.280]   that makes them recur back and forth periodically.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.680]   - Why do I find that reassuring,
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.400]   that if you get down to a small enough level
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.840]   that you can really predict what's gonna happen
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.080]   as opposed to small perturbations
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.160]   leading to big differences in outcome?
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.640]   - That was the whole point.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.920]   We discovered that quantum mechanics,
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.080]   there are waves and interferences and so on
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.440]   that make the system recur, you know?
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.000]   As a matter of fact, I had quite an exchange
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.160]   with Dick Feynman about it, you know?
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.480]   When I met him, I went to give a talk at Caltech,
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.120]   and I was in his office, and he said,
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.720]   "So what are you gonna talk about?
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.360]   "Because I don't wanna waste my time."
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.600]   And I said, "About chaos."
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.160]   He said, "Okay."
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.800]   I said, "You know, some things are very,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.080]   "in particular, in quantum mechanics."
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   So I'm smiling because he was so sharp and so on.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.080]   So he said, "Okay, give me the problem."
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.000]   And he said, "What is it?"
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.200]   I said, "Well, okay, I give you an electron,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.920]   "and you have it in a potential, and I give you a laser."
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.680]   And he says, "The laser inside or outside the apparatus?"
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.440]   Just like that. (laughs)
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.280]   So I said, "Outside."
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.000]   So you turn on the laser, and I said,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   "So what happens to the electron?"
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.840]   And I knew he was gonna give me the answer
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.080]   that was already in the literature,
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.720]   but he appeared to be thinking that.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.320]   He stood up and walked around,
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.520]   and was making all sorts of noises.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.880]   And then suddenly he says,
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.600]   "The energy grows linearly in time."
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.400]   I said, "No, it doesn't.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.240]   "How do you know?"
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.080]   I said, "We measure it.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.680]   "I can show you," and so on.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.880]   And he was very impressed,
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.960]   because that means that there is no chaos, actually.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.120]   Then he said, "Oh, you know why I got it wrong."
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.560]   I said, "No, because I wasn't thinking in colors,
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.800]   "only black and white."
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.040]   (laughs)
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.080]   - Was he trying to be funny?
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.680]   - Of course, he was always funny.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.160]   - Let's talk about Feynman, and Gell-Mann, and Mandelbrot,
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.520]   and all the rest as a collection for a moment.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:34.720]   One of the great gifts of my life has been
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.000]   that you would talk about scientists.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   It really enchants me.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.720]   I'm like, I'm just so delighted when I hear it.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.800]   I grew up hearing the stories about these scientists,
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.800]   and not athletes, which is great, but scientists.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.840]   And it seems to me that every time you talk
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.840]   about another scientist, you both revere the work they did.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.160]   You see something unique about them.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.520]   And something I learned very early on,
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.800]   and I've certainly internalized is,
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.200]   and forgive me because I'm assuming here,
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.200]   is that there's a certain aspect of their quirkiness
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.880]   or something about them, to take them seriously,
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.120]   but not too seriously.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.400]   I never learned to assume that
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.080]   because somebody was a Nobel Prize winner
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.760]   that they were perfect, for instance.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.480]   Like you would tell me, like Einstein had,
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.120]   he was amazing, like he was relatively,
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.200]   the patent office, all this stuff,
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.200]   and he had all these problems with women.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.080]   - Or, you know, and I read the books, right?
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.880]   Or this person, I won't name names
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.840]   'cause these people are still alive, Silicon Valley.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.320]   Actually, when you and I used to take walks
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.160]   when I was a postdoc,
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.800]   we used to see Jobs walking around, right?
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.960]   No feet, no shoes, he had feet, no shoes.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.880]   And you would say, you know, I mean, like, he's amazing.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.760]   Like, this guy's brilliant.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.040]   But then we would chuckle about some of the Jobisms,
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:57.880]   you know? - Yes.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.040]   - And so one thing that I learned
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.760]   was that scientists are just people,
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.600]   that these founders, the creators, they're just people.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.680]   And they often have very challenging areas
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.040]   of their life as well.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.280]   Like, they're not perfect, they're not gods.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.880]   Some of them have almost godlike access
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.280]   to the universe and understanding it.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.080]   But it seems to me that, like,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.000]   you hold people up for their contributions,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.920]   but you never actually, thank goodness,
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.000]   put people on a pedestal to the point where you're like,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.320]   this person is spectacular in every way.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.000]   And I'm not saying you cut them down to size,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.720]   but I learned very, and this has served me well in my life
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.960]   and now public facing or on Twitter.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.680]   Like, if I make a mistake and someone comes at me,
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.880]   it's somebody that I respect, I go, ah.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.800]   But then I remember, like, this person has a lot of issues
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.420]   in certain domains of their life.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.320]   So, to realize that, like, we're all human,
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.040]   like this notion of, like, none of us are gods.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.640]   And yet there are people like Feynman,
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.600]   like Gell-Mann, like Einstein,
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.120]   who have almost supernatural levels of ability.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.160]   Yeah, so what's that about?
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.080]   Like, how do you hold knowledge, insight,
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   and stature in your mind alongside, like, the humanness,
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.460]   like, the inherent flawed nature of all of us, you know?
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.460]   - Well, okay, it's complicated.
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.680]   There are many ways to think about it.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.380]   In some of these names, you know, for instance,
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:31.300]   these people are built into giants by the media too.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.100]   I mean, you know, Feynman, I mean,
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.460]   if you go to Quora and so on, everybody's asking, you know,
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.580]   what did Feynman do, what was he wearing, and so on,
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.120]   as if, you know, he was a god.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.020]   I mean, obviously what he did in physics.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.480]   He, and I interrupt myself here
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.720]   because he really worked very hard,
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.700]   very hard, according to Gell-Mann in particular,
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.040]   to creating a myth about himself.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:51.880]   He worked very hard.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.360]   When I met him, I can't even tell you the anecdotes.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.680]   I only met him for an hour,
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.720]   but he was obviously the kind of man
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.200]   that wanted to leave an impression with you.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.880]   - R-rated and X-rated anecdotes.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.080]   - Exactly, and, you know, but I remember the good one
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.880]   was that, you know, I was gonna give a colloquium,
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.480]   and he said, "Should I come?"
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.560]   I say, "I think you should come."
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.360]   And then he said, "Well, then I'm gonna give you
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.200]   "a piece of advice.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.960]   "Do not look at me, because if you look at me
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.180]   "during your talk, you're gonna get confused,"
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.300]   and so on, you know?
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.940]   And actually, that's exactly what happened.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.420]   I started, you know, the colloquium at Caltech,
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.780]   you know, the marine boot camp of science,
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.220]   and there I am, starting to talk,
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.460]   and suddenly I said, instead of saying, "The next hour,"
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.340]   I said something like, "In the next week,"
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.100]   or something or so, because there he was,
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.300]   and then he started saying, you know,
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.940]   "Like, look elsewhere, elsewhere," you know?
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.060]   That kind of guy, you know?
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.420]   - For anyone who hasn't lectured,
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.660]   there's a tendency sometimes when one is going fast
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.260]   to fill in without thinking.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.940]   It's just something that one learns.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.580]   I mean, I've had to learn it the hard way
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.980]   when we missed it in the recording and this kind of thing.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.220]   It's a humbling moment, but yeah,
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.200]   I think that, well, Feynman would have been canceled
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.720]   by the standards of the last few years.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.380]   - I took even my father once to a lecture
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   he was giving in San Francisco,
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.980]   and he was giving a beautiful lecture to,
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.140]   I don't know, get some award for teaching, and so on,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.600]   and suddenly a bunch of women walked into the front
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.700]   of the big room, you know, and they started coming,
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.180]   because it turns out that in one of his lectures,
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.500]   he said something like, you know,
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.860]   "If you do it this way, you're as bad as a woman's driver,"
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.140]   as, you know- - Feynman said.
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.820]   - Feynman said that, and then all these women
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.140]   were saying things, and then he said,
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.980]   "I love women, they're all smart."
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.820]   He was very clever.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.100]   - Yeah, so he would have lost his job
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.020]   by the standards of recent years.
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.420]   - Might be, yeah, yeah, okay, but regardless of that,
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.620]   'cause I really want to go back to this issue,
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.500]   people like Merrick Gell-Mann, I mean, it was,
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.460]   to me, he was the most intimidating person I've ever met.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.620]   I mean, now, eventually I got to know him
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.620]   because he liked what I was doing,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.260]   and as a matter of fact, he and I organized a workshop
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:43.980]   in an incredibly luxurious place in France,
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.100]   at the estate of Madame Schlumberger,
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.780]   one of the oiled people.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.820]   Actually, it was an incredible meeting
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.180]   that he and I organized,
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.740]   so I got to know him a little bit personally,
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.340]   and all he was complaining at that time
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.580]   is he couldn't get a date.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.860]   He was a widow, and he wanted to, you know,
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.780]   women were intimidated by him, too.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.700]   - Well, as I recall, 'cause I remember meeting him
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.900]   when I was a kid, and we both shared a love of birds,
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.900]   but he was perhaps one of the world's most obnoxious people.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.940]   - Right, but you impressed him.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.820]   As a matter of fact, I still, you know,
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.500]   I don't know if you want me to remind you of this,
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.140]   because we had two stories there.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.060]   Your mother and I were taking a hike in Aspen,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.380]   and we saw a bird that looked incredibly complicated,
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.980]   and so on, so we looked at the bird.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.260]   The next day, we went to him,
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.180]   because he loved birds, as you know,
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.780]   and I said I saw a most unusual bird.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.860]   He said, "Describe it," so I drew it up,
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.620]   and he gave me the name in Latin of the bird,
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.700]   and then he said, "That's the most common bird
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.260]   "in the Bay Area of California.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.420]   "As a matter of fact, you should see it
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:39.900]   "when you pick up the newspaper next time you're there,"
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.060]   and indeed, two weeks later,
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.380]   I went to pick up the New York Times,
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.380]   and there was the bird, but at the same time,
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.780]   I said, "Andrew likes birds," and he asked you,
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.380]   "What is your favorite bird?"
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:52.340]   And you said, "The rainbow lowerkeit."
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.180]   - Still is.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.500]   - And he said, "This kid knows.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.940]   "This kid knows," he said.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.660]   - I know my birds.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.900]   I know my birds. - No, no, that is amazing.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:03.180]   I never heard, because if you could have said a parrot,
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.940]   he would have not been very interested, okay?
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.740]   But he was intimidating, very intimidating,
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.420]   and he was nasty, too, when he wanted to be,
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.100]   so he enjoyed the power he had.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.940]   I was a member of the board of the directors
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:20.180]   of the Aspen Center, so we had to decide
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.580]   what programs we had every summer,
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:22.820]   and he would come to me and say,
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:24.940]   "Whom do you want me to insult today?"
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.820]   He had all sorts of very funny names
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.500]   for all sorts of physicists and so on.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.420]   The downside of people like that in science,
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.380]   'cause I've known some, too,
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.060]   there's a very famous neuroscientist now in his 70s
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.260]   who has a Nobel Prize, who also is known
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.520]   for generating anecdotes about himself.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.940]   And in recent years, because of political correctness,
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.480]   wokeism, and so forth, tends to do that less,
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.980]   'cause he was sort of a trucker's mouth.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:56.780]   Brilliant guy, but he's known for being outrageous
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.020]   and trying to create tales about themselves.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.540]   This is something that scientists do.
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.380]   - Yeah, right, right.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.700]   - Right, in order to maintain their legacy.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.580]   - Yeah, also to feel good about themselves.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.740]   I mean, by the way, I mean, Gell-Mann,
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.900]   I mean, I work with him, he was incredible.
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.500]   I mean, you know, and the way he would interrupt people
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.820]   and so on, and there are two things I can tell you
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.660]   that are interesting.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.420]   Once he was announcing some new results,
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.140]   he was working on this whole thing on quarks
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:25.140]   and other things, and actually it was string theory,
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.340]   and he announced a seminar,
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.020]   and everybody goes into the garden,
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.580]   you know, and the seminars are nice.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.100]   I need to remind the audience, perhaps here,
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:36.220]   that the Aspen Center for Music was right next door,
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.820]   in the tent, they were rehearsing.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.860]   So the seminar was supposed to start at three,
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.660]   and there's, Gell-Mann comes with all his notes
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:42.500]   and then he's out.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.540]   He always had notes, walking, pacing, and nothing happened.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.740]   And suddenly, they were rehearsing
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.460]   the Beethoven's fifth symphony,
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.940]   which starts, ta-ta-ta-tan, and then you heard the sound,
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.220]   and then he started.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.500]   I will now tell you about a new theory
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.900]   of how the universe works.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:58.740]   That's the way he spoke.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.340]   - So what strikes me is that these people
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.060]   take themselves very seriously.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.660]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.660]   - Do you think that's important in life?
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.860]   - I don't, I like to, I mean, as you know,
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.620]   I like to have a good sense of humor about myself
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.100]   and be self-deprecating.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.940]   I think some people, you know, have issues,
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.820]   and they do that.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.900]   I mean, it all depends on how do you, you know, see things.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.140]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.740]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Matina.
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.860]   Matina makes loose-leaf and ready-to-drink yerba mate.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.180]   Now, I've often discussed yerba mate's benefits,
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.860]   such as regulating blood sugar,
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.740]   its high antioxidant content,
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.500]   the ways it can improve digestion,
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.460]   and its possible neuroprotective effects.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:37.500]   It's for all those reasons
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.340]   that yerba mate is my preferred source of caffeine.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.380]   I also drink yerba mate because I simply love the taste.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.140]   And while there are a lot of different choices out there
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.500]   of yerba mate drinks,
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.300]   my personal favorite, far and away, is Matina.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.980]   It's made of the highest quality ingredients,
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.180]   which gives it a really rich,
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.860]   but also a really clean taste.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.740]   So none of that tannic aftertaste.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.700]   In fact, given how amazing Matina tastes
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.260]   and their commitment to quality,
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.720]   I decided to become a part owner
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.300]   in the company earlier this year.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.660]   In particular, I love the taste
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.860]   of Matina's canned zero-sugar cold brew yerba mate,
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:08.740]   which I personally help develop.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.180]   I drink at least three cans of those a day now.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.960]   I also love their loose-leaf Matina,
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.660]   which I drink every morning from the gourd.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.560]   So I add hot water and sip on that thing,
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.800]   and I'll have some cold brews
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.740]   throughout the morning and early afternoon.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:22.020]   I find it gives me terrific energy all day long,
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.500]   and I'm able to fall asleep perfectly well at night,
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.380]   no problems.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.700]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.940]   you can go to drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:32.300]   Right now, Matina is offering a free one-pound bag
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.140]   of loose-leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping,
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.500]   with the purchase of two cases
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.260]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.340]   Again, that's drinkmatina.com/huberman
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.800]   to get a free bag of yerba mate loose-leaf tea
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.780]   and free shipping.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.020]   Let me ask you about this.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.700]   So, you know, further down my list
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.740]   of things I want to talk to you about is that,
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.740]   you know, you've always loved,
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.300]   it's clear from a young age,
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.820]   like high-level concepts, deep concepts,
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.300]   order in the universe, working on hard problems.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.620]   You just filed another patent.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:04.500]   Like, I mean, as long as I've known you,
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.260]   you've been pursuing some new area of knowledge
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.420]   or implementation of knowledge.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.100]   And yet, you, like your father,
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.560]   I know you delight in everyday things.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.820]   I mean, since I was a kid,
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:21.620]   you've taken a walk after dinner.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.580]   You've biked to work if you can,
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.020]   you know, that day because of the weather.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.940]   You love, like, a really good espresso,
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:28.900]   a really good meal.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:33.220]   Like, the high and the low are checked-off boxes for you.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.060]   - Yes. - Right?
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.400]   That's different, I think,
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.460]   than the way most people think about scientists,
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:41.540]   especially theoreticians, theorists, excuse me.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:45.100]   Which one is it, theoreticians or theorists?
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.100]   - Theorists, they say, yeah. - Theorists.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:51.060]   - That, you know, we assume like the academics
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.020]   that are always somewhere else,
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.780]   like they're up here, they're not grounded,
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:56.260]   they're not feet on the ground.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.900]   But you like everyday things.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.260]   - Oh, absolutely. - Like, you very much like,
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.660]   like where we're gonna eat dinner tonight
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.300]   is every bit as important as this-
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.460]   - Absolutely. - The conversation
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.300]   about relativity.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.580]   I think that there is a myth
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.360]   that sometimes gets perpetrated at universities.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.940]   My first meeting with my advisor
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.780]   when I got to University of Pennsylvania,
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.300]   he said, "I want you to know one thing.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.140]   "You're gonna live like a monk."
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.380]   I said, "What does that mean?"
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.240]   "No fun, nothing, you're gonna work.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.220]   "I want you to work.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.980]   "You're getting paid to do something."
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.420]   I was so scared.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.820]   And then I told him that on weekends
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.100]   I had to escape to New York City
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.760]   to take a walk on Central Park and look at nice things.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.980]   And, you know, I always enjoyed the good things of life.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.100]   And, you know, at that time I couldn't afford them,
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.860]   but that doesn't mean that I didn't, you know, enjoy them.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.620]   And I do believe that I inherit this from my father,
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.860]   a tremendous enjoyment of life in general.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.620]   And yes, I am very physical and tactile about things.
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:52.220]   I like to surround myself with things that are beautiful.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.760]   I enjoy, as you said, good meals
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.220]   and the daily things about life.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:00.460]   I'm not just living in some stratosphere
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.940]   and not being able to, you know,
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.100]   enjoy a meal I'm having and so on.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.420]   No, the opposite.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.860]   And yes, in that sense, I am very much like that.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.380]   And, you know, Mary's the same way.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.940]   And so that's why I enjoy that.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:14.780]   - Your wife.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.060]   - Yeah, my wife, sorry.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.980]   Yes, we really enjoy, you know,
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.840]   she in particular being Danish, you know,
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.860]   they have this idea of slow eating
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.340]   and enjoying the good things of life.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.180]   And I'm very much like that.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.180]   Yes, very much.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.800]   I don't feel guilty about it.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.380]   You know, if I can afford it.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.220]   - Nor should you.
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.040]   - Huh?
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:33.880]   - Nor should you.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.340]   - Well, there is a certain aesthetic component to science
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.820]   and the idea that they sell you that, you know,
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.160]   Einstein didn't care about anything.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.820]   Actually, if you look at the negotiations
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.600]   that Einstein had with Institute for Advanced Studies
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.140]   for salaries, you'll see that he really cared a lot
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:46.980]   about these things too.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:49.220]   - Oh, so our notion of him is just kind of like,
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.940]   it was just science and he had no interest
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.780]   in material things at all.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.740]   - Right, right, yes.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:55.360]   I had an uncle actually, Hector's father.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.620]   You know, there was a branch of the family
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.980]   that was very much into culture.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.100]   They had beautiful collections of paintings and so on.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.180]   And once, I was, what, 14 or so.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.700]   And I remember at a party,
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.340]   we had big social parties in my parents' house.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:09.580]   And he was lecturing me that I should never care
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:13.340]   about anything but truth and concepts and so on.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:14.920]   I was a little bit scared.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.420]   I wanted to enjoy life as well.
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.380]   Okay, so it was a little bit complicated.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.260]   No, no, I enjoy everything, of course.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:26.620]   I think I got out of my father mostly, yes.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.560]   My mother was a little more aesthetic in a way.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.860]   But yes, the tiny little things of life
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.180]   are what makes one's life, you know.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.820]   - I'm slowly starting to get that.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.660]   - Yes, yes.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.300]   - I feel like I've been a little like rabid
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.220]   about my interests, almost to an obsessive level,
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:46.600]   to the point where I've sometimes overlooked
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.700]   like how many opportunities for just like
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.380]   lovely daily interactions I have.
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.060]   I try, but I feel like I've just been chasing
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:57.020]   the carrot of knowledge.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.060]   Like, I love doing what I do.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.500]   I've always done that, you know, but.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.300]   - Well, but you have to be careful indeed.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.580]   I, you know, as you know,
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.460]   I meditate for many years and so on.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:07.220]   And being in the present and being able to just,
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.540]   you know, be there and nothing else
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.580]   is a tremendous source of satisfaction
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.060]   and calms me down and so on.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.780]   - When did you start that?
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:20.620]   - Well, I started actually out of the discovery.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.420]   I mean, a trivial thing that many people have.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.460]   I discovered that every time my blood pressure
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.580]   was taken by the doctor,
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:29.180]   it was just going through the roof.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.860]   You know, it's called a white coat phenomenon
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.780]   or something of that sort.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:33.420]   And I got very, very upset about it
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.460]   because I tried to control it.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.140]   And it got worse and worse and worse.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.340]   And they told me, you know, what to do.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.820]   And so at one point or the other,
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.380]   I have a friend, a colleague, more than a friend,
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.580]   who's a Buddhist, who started telling me about,
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.420]   you know, have you tried, first of all, biofeedback?
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.060]   That's the one I tried for a year.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.780]   I did biofeedback.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.060]   And then he started telling me about meditation.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:58.020]   So one day, actually, he's a physicist as well.
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:59.540]   He was visiting me in my lab.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.860]   And I said, he said, let me, let's do it.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:03.380]   I did a session with him on meditation.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:04.540]   And I couldn't believe it.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.820]   My hands suddenly were warm and, you know,
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.460]   felt incredibly nice.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:11.460]   So I decided that I really wanted to learn how to do it.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.220]   And I started doing it at a time when I truly needed it
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:19.220]   because I realized that without being aware, I was anxious.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.340]   Like, for instance, I would see myself
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.780]   walking down the street, holding my, you know,
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.060]   fists this way.
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.780]   That's not a very relaxed way of living, okay?
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.620]   So I really started doing this meditation
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.540]   on a fairly continuous basis, and I really enjoy it.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.940]   And it's very important as, you know, as a father,
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.660]   I say this to anyone too, that you have to enjoy life.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.940]   I mean, pursuing these things, you know, eventually,
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:48.580]   what, you know, the value is in the pursuit,
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.900]   not in achieving them anyhow.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.340]   So you might as well pursue many things at the same time.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.660]   I mean, a good meal, eaten properly,
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.300]   can be very, very nice too.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.660]   - I love that about you.
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.940]   It's something I'm working on.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.740]   I remember when I, along those lines,
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.740]   I remember when I was in graduate school,
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.020]   we published a paper,
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.700]   and then we published a second paper in science.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.820]   And I remember thinking, like,
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.060]   this is like such a proud moment,
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.060]   a first author paper in the journal "Science."
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.340]   And I told you, and you said,
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:20.340]   "Well, enjoy it and just be aware that by tomorrow,
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.580]   you'll be worried that you'll never do it again."
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.220]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.780]   - And fortunately, we published in "Nature"
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.860]   and a few other journals a bunch of times after that.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:32.700]   But you also warned me about the postpartum
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:37.780]   of post excitement, like something great happens.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.140]   You know, at that time, we, as a field of neuroscience,
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.060]   didn't really understand dopamine dynamics,
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:42.900]   but now we do.
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.860]   What you were describing is this trough in dopamine
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:48.420]   that we get a day or two after some big event.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.260]   - Yes.
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.080]   - Typically, postpartum is associated
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:50.920]   with the birth of a child,
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.820]   but it could be, you know, getting a degree
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.660]   or a great party or a paper in "Science" or "Nature,"
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.500]   first author paper.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.980]   And you said, "A couple of days from now,
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.540]   you're gonna feel low and you just have to wait."
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.340]   And I'll never forget what you said.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:07.920]   You said, "Just go back to what inspired the first project,
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.260]   pick a different problem, it'll happen again."
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:11.580]   And the second time it happened, I was like,
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.900]   "He was right, it happened again and again and again."
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.860]   I haven't had an infinite number of those papers
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.980]   in those journals, but I learned about
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.140]   the dopamine dynamics associated with pursuing a goal.
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:25.140]   And then you get the thing and you're very excited
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.580]   and then you feel the drop.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:27.820]   - Yes, yes.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.340]   And that, I think, that is something
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.140]   that even ancient philosophers knew about it.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:35.340]   The Buddha, many, you know, the Greeks and so on,
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.660]   this idea that the things we pursue,
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:39.780]   they are ephemeral in a way,
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.140]   in the way the feelings, they elicit in us, you know?
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.740]   And I think that you're right.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:48.060]   And there is also another tendency one has to try to avoid,
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:49.820]   which is you're successful in something
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.220]   and you continue doing exactly the same thing
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.140]   because, you know, by now you know how to do it
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.660]   with your hands tied here.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.860]   And I always felt that I want to go elsewhere.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.260]   And, you know, I have sort of a reputation
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.100]   for changing fields and, you know,
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:06.500]   I don't do that in order for others to be puzzled by it.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.740]   It's just that I'm curious
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.700]   and I want to have a feeling again,
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.900]   that like falling in love, you know, the new thing,
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.380]   you know, it's nice at the beginning,
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.340]   but eventually whatever you're doing,
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:18.580]   it becomes, you know, trite and so on.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:22.180]   - Yeah, let's talk about that because after chaos,
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:23.580]   which brought a lot of, you know,
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.340]   I remember we had reporters in our house
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.340]   and there was like a TV and the book by Jim Glick,
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.540]   and then you switched to something completely different.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:32.380]   - Yes, yes.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.540]   - And you got into computer science.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.220]   - Yeah, well, computer science is a--
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.300]   - Computers. - Computers.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:39.780]   What happened was that a lot of the success that we had
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:40.940]   was because I was at PARC.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.620]   We had phenomenal computer facilities there,
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.140]   things that we could visualize at a time
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.780]   very few people could do.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:48.500]   And so, and one of them actually,
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.900]   someone suggested I get a patent.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.980]   There is a patent for the chaos
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.580]   that sometimes people have in T-shirts
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.300]   that actually we discovered for the first time
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.220]   with guys from UC Santa Cruz,
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.100]   with Jim Crutchfield and so on.
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.700]   You know, he was actually very instrumental
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.220]   in getting me into chaos and so on.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.860]   But that is, but when I, what happened was,
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:08.220]   okay, so we did this, we did quantum.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.500]   And then one day I said, okay, so what do I do now?
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.500]   Okay, well, you can go and publish one paper
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.340]   after that in chaos.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.300]   I mean, you can produce 10 PhDs with this.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.100]   But then I said, why don't I do the opposite?
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.940]   I'm using computers to help me in the physics.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:22.420]   Why don't I use the physics to study computers?
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.020]   Well, that's an interesting idea,
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.060]   but you know, I mean, so why don't you do that?
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.980]   So what happened to me,
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.420]   I was at a meeting on chaos in Copenhagen
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.740]   and I couldn't sleep one night
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:35.260]   and I had a book called "The Computer Red Brain"
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.700]   by John von Neumann,
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.780]   perhaps someone that was a true genius.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.100]   I don't know if you heard of him.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.980]   He invented computers.
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.620]   He was a phenomenon at all levels.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:47.460]   And he was part of the Manhattan Project.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.260]   He was perhaps one of the most brilliant people
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.140]   that ever existed, at least that we are aware of.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:53.100]   I mean, he was at the Institute for Advanced Studies
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.100]   for Neumann.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.980]   There are all sorts of anecdotes about him.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.220]   He had a photographic memory.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.500]   You could give him a page of a phone book.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.620]   He would look at it, close it,
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:02.220]   and then he would recite the phone numbers
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.820]   from bottom to top.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:05.340]   - Totally useless skill.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.700]   - Yeah, but he was a genius, a genius, true genius.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.820]   He invented computers.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.540]   He invented game theory in economics.
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.380]   I mean, it was- - Useful skill.
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.820]   - Yeah, exactly, okay.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.780]   In any event, so he wrote a very little book
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.420]   called "The Computer and the Brain."
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.540]   No equations, nothing.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.500]   And one night, four o'clock in the morning,
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.340]   I cannot sleep.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.700]   I get down, you know, it was summer,
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.900]   so the sun was still setting in Copenhagen.
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:27.740]   And I went there to read it.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.980]   And I said, "This is what I'm going to do.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.500]   I don't know anything about brains,
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:32.900]   but I can imagine, you know,
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.140]   if the brain is like a computer,
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.580]   I could do something like that.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.540]   But I also want to apply some of what I know
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:38.780]   to these things."
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.180]   And the first thing that occurred to me
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.060]   was to start looking at the computer network
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.380]   we had at Park.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.140]   These computers were communicating with each other
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.220]   as we nowadays, we know, that's the internet and so on.
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.540]   So there were many, many aspects of this.
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:55.700]   And I decided that because I was very influenced
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.540]   by one or two students that were very much into economics
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.180]   and libertarian ideas and so on.
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.980]   And one of them had taken two courses in econ at Caltech.
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.460]   So we decided to start looking at this as a market
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.980]   where computers essentially buy and sell programs
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:11.620]   to execute in their machines and so on.
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.100]   So we started really doing
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   what we call the ecology of computation.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.620]   It was a big effort,
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.340]   which married economics
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.820]   with artificial intelligence and computer.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.180]   But it became a big thing.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.980]   And so I became, again, it's like falling in love again.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.860]   It's a new field.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:27.260]   I thought it was great.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.940]   - Yeah, the discovery process of falling in love
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.300]   is half the fun.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.140]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:33.780]   And I also was able to, I mean,
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.740]   there is a lot of formalism in economics
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.220]   and some of it is really, I mean, sort of academic.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:41.300]   But there are some ideas that are very profound
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:42.740]   to the extent that some people
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.500]   consider me an economist sometimes,
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.220]   because I think in terms of utility rewards
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:48.620]   and risk and all this stuff.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.460]   And as a matter of fact,
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.820]   a lot of the work I'm doing now on resource allocation
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.260]   in networks comes from ideas from economics.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.820]   - When you go into a new field,
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:01.940]   in order to learn about the field,
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.100]   is that mainly through talking to people in the field,
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.020]   reading books?
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:05.940]   - Both, both.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:07.900]   - And it doesn't strike me
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:10.380]   that you have ever tried to ingratiate yourself
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.580]   into any field.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.780]   It's not like you're trying to be a member of the field.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   Like you go in as an observer and a learner.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.900]   - Yes, I need to say this.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.740]   I don't think that many people have said
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.580]   if I stayed in one field,
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.660]   I would have done much better
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.500]   in terms of reputation and so on.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.740]   As a matter of fact, I can tell you an anecdote that is--
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.220]   - You mean like awards and stuff?
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.980]   - Yeah, like for instance, not long ago,
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:36.620]   I was already doing computers after chaos and so on.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.020]   I won't name the person,
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.980]   but a very good physicist professor at Berkeley
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.060]   came into my office and says,
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.260]   Bernardo, we have an issue here.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.260]   I said, what is it?
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.220]   That your name for a membership
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.780]   in the National Academy of Sciences is coming up.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.220]   I said, oh, that's nice.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.460]   He said, well, it's a problem.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.220]   You're not writing papers in physics.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.660]   You're writing papers in computer science.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.180]   And we need a physicist because otherwise,
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.660]   the chemists will get that job.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:40:59.660]   The physicists don't--
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:00.820]   - Like welcome to academia.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.940]   - Yeah, so I said, well, you want me to do?
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.700]   He said, well, can you perhaps write one or two more papers
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:06.540]   on this so we can show?
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.900]   I said, no, I cannot do that.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:08.860]   I can't.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:12.100]   - Well, isn't there a famous story about Feynman
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.780]   and being elected to the National Academy?
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:15.020]   - Yeah, he refused to, yes.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:16.580]   - Right, I think they told him
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.180]   he was in the National Academy.
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.540]   And then he said, well, what do I do?
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.100]   And they said, well, you elect in other members.
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.940]   And he said, I quit.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.340]   - Well, yeah, so in any event,
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.260]   I never became a member of the National Academy.
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:29.380]   - But you never sought prizes.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.140]   - No, I mean, I would have liked to get them.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:31.980]   Why not?
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.380]   I mean, it's not that I said they are meaningless,
[01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:37.740]   but there was nothing that I could do about it.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.820]   And since I was not, as you said,
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.780]   I was always a little bit of a,
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.700]   always moving on to the next thing,
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:46.500]   never staying long enough going to these meetings
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.900]   where by now you heard it all over and over and over again.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.100]   So, yeah.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:52.700]   - Yeah, I mean, I have to say that,
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.540]   you know, like, I mean, as you know,
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:55.980]   I still have my position at Stanford
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.300]   and teach, I'm involved in a little bit of research.
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.860]   But, you know, one of the great advantages I had
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:07.060]   is that all my advisors died or killed themselves.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.140]   So I was orphaned in science.
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.740]   And so there was never an expectation from my advisors
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:14.500]   that I do the next thing 'cause they were dead.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.260]   So I thought about that,
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.380]   but I remember when I launched the podcast
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:21.580]   or started going on podcasts,
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.740]   I remember you being a little bit concerned.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.580]   You're like, you know,
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:25.540]   what are your colleagues gonna think?
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.100]   And I think at that point,
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:32.180]   the way that science was going and the structure of academia
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:34.140]   relative to what my needs in life were
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:36.780]   and just a passion to wanting to do something new,
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:38.500]   I put a lot of thought to the fact
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.700]   that you've changed fields many times.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:43.860]   And I just felt absolutely compelled
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.460]   to get into science communication.
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.060]   And there was no stopping that.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.500]   But I have to thank you a lot of the reason
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.500]   I was able to take the step to do the podcast
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:55.380]   in addition to being supported by Lex Friedman's suggestions
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.860]   and a lot of help from others,
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:59.940]   Joe Rogan and others.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.460]   But is that, I was like,
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.980]   well, that's what you're supposed to do.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:07.140]   When you hit a point where what you're doing
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140]   isn't as compelling,
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.580]   you wait for the thing that draws you forward.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:12.020]   Seems like you were always drawn forward.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.300]   I was thinking of carrot and stick.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.380]   It's not like you disliked where you were.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:17.340]   It's that there was some carrot that you identified
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.540]   and you go towards the carrots.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.340]   - And also something very,
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:22.740]   the other day, my wife was actually mentioning,
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.220]   I've been, in a sense, an orphan.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:25.820]   I never had mentors.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:26.660]   It's very interesting.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:30.340]   - Except this, frankly, not terrific graduate advisor.
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.700]   - He was not my mentor, really.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:32.980]   I mean, you know, he didn't even want me
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.180]   to do the things that I wanted to do.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.460]   So I never had someone who was whispering,
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.500]   Bernardo is the guy too,
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.220]   you should be considering for this or that.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:44.700]   I mean, I had the fortune to really get to the top
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:45.660]   of many of these fields
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.460]   and I interacted with the top people.
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.300]   I mean, we talk about Feynman and Gell-Mann.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.060]   There are many very famous people
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:54.900]   that I respect immensely that I met when I was in France.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.340]   You know, as you know, I was teaching there.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.140]   I met people that are brilliant and so on.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.660]   And I felt treated with tremendous amount of respect
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:01.660]   as a colleague and so on.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.780]   But I never had mentors in that sense.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:06.820]   And also, as I said, I am a little bit restless.
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:09.180]   I am very curious about everything.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.260]   And so, you know, sometimes I see something
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.460]   and I say, oh, there's an opportunity
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:13.740]   to do something interesting.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.900]   I think that the issue of being curious
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.260]   is extremely important.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.380]   And it's interesting because I reflect a lot
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:20.540]   on, say, my father.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.780]   My father was an immensely curious person,
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:24.260]   but all about details.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.020]   He never liked abstractions of any kind.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:30.620]   He was very proud that he went to the same school I went
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.340]   and the only course he flanked was philosophy
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.140]   because he said it doesn't make any sense.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.620]   Now, perhaps he was right about that.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.820]   You know, sometimes you wonder about
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.580]   what these philosophers talk about.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.020]   A couple of months ago in Denmark,
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:45.700]   we were invited, my wife and I,
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.460]   to a dinner with philosophers
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.140]   talking about artificial intelligence.
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.700]   I thought these people were,
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.420]   they didn't really know what was going on.
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:57.060]   But nevertheless, yes, I am curious
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.660]   and sometimes I move on to things.
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.940]   And I feel that the reward, the internal reward you get
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:05.140]   from doing something new and interesting and exciting
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.660]   is much better than a recognition
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:09.780]   that someone will come and say, you know, whatever.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.500]   I mean, don't misunderstand me.
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:14.020]   I will not say no to a recognition.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:15.460]   But it's not really that I'm,
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.940]   I do this in order to get that.
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.540]   That's not me at all.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.780]   - Yeah, I mean, the whole thing,
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:24.580]   it sort of brings my thinking back
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.660]   to like the early discussions about, you know,
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.420]   other students are not interested in physics,
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:29.380]   you're interested in physics.
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:31.220]   Other people are like smoking a lot of weed
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:33.700]   and partying, like, no, like,
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:36.700]   like you said, you've not had mentors.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:39.020]   That's one area in which you and I have been very different.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:42.380]   I've always attached myself to mentors, many of them.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:43.540]   Many of them, I mean.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:45.620]   - Well, there might be a psychological reason too.
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.540]   That you need this, you know,
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.220]   or needed that one point of that is parental type figures.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.700]   Yeah, sorry, yeah, there might be.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.780]   I wish I had them, don't misunderstand me.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.300]   As a matter of fact, I mean, my influence on my students,
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.500]   I produce more than 15 PhDs.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:02.940]   It's also strange because none of them stayed in physics.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.900]   Now, the department at Stanford was not too happy with that.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.100]   It's not that I told them not to,
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.780]   but they all smelled that, you know,
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.300]   I was doing something else.
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:12.700]   I mean, you know, from computers,
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.500]   I became very aware of what was going on
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.900]   very early on with the internet.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:18.260]   As you know, I started doing all this stuff on social
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:19.740]   long before anyone was doing,
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.100]   and economics of attention and all that stuff.
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.580]   And many of the students, the other day,
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.460]   I found one of them, I met one,
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.620]   Lada Damich, who, you know, I think you-
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:28.900]   - She was early at Google.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.820]   - No, she went to Facebook.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.700]   And the other day, she wrote me a note.
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.980]   I was so lucky that I met you.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.940]   She was gonna do a thesis on, I don't know what,
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:37.380]   solar, collecting solar.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.780]   - Yeah, you've collected some pretty interesting students.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:43.540]   They're like a pretty, we won't name names other than Laza,
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:45.780]   but like some of them are very well-known people
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.980]   in the tech industry now.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:47.820]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:50.140]   - And I think that, yeah, it seemed like the people
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.180]   that would gravitate towards you.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.620]   It's interesting, your laboratory is off campus.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.300]   So anyone that decides to be off campus
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.660]   is already making a choice toward,
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.340]   like they don't wanna be part of the standard culture.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:46:59.500]   - But they thought it was interesting.
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.580]   So let me, I wanna get back to this issue
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:06.300]   of like internet and Silicon Valley.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.580]   I recall it was the early '90s.
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.140]   So it'd be like '89, '90, '91.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:14.900]   Remember I had this girlfriend, Gretchen, remember?
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:18.260]   And her dad was the editor of "Guitar Player" magazine.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:20.580]   And I'll never forget, he told me, he said,
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.860]   "It's gonna be all about multimedia."
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:24.700]   Remember that?
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:25.700]   No one talks about multimedia.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.580]   He said, "Your television is gonna be,
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:33.580]   "your computer is gonna be, your stereo is gonna."
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.140]   I mean, he was right, right?
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.180]   He was basically, everything was gonna be synthesized
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.700]   into common devices.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.300]   And we now know that that were not to be true.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:45.700]   But at what point did you decide that things like computers
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:48.580]   were mainly going to be a route to industry
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.820]   and not to academia?
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.220]   This is really important, I think,
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:54.460]   for people to understand because right now
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.780]   it's kind of happening in biomedical sciences.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:57.780]   But you see this at Stanford.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.340]   People get degrees in computer science,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:02.300]   but not to become computer science professors, sometimes,
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.440]   but really so that they can go into industry.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.020]   So how do you see nowadays, like for people
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:10.300]   that are interested in science or technology,
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:12.020]   do they need to go to graduate school?
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.980]   Like is a PhD useful anymore?
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.140]   - Peter Thiel says that you shouldn't even get a bachelor's.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.500]   I think that's what he, you know.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:20.060]   - I mean, I have great respect for Peter,
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.260]   great respect for Peter.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.900]   There are a lot of things that are easier to say
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:24.180]   when you're already a billionaire.
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.020]   - No, no, no, I know.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.340]   Like Steve Jobs saying, you know, passion is everything.
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:31.060]   - Right, I mean, necessary, but not sufficient.
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:31.880]   - Right, right, right.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.720]   - Necessary, but not sufficient.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.380]   - So I think that what's happening today,
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.060]   I mean, technology, we are going
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.580]   through a technological revolution.
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:39.020]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.260]   We used to learn about the printing press
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.820]   and now it's the same thing with computers.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.740]   I still remember, and I, you know, we, this is amazing
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.940]   because, you know, today is so, so obvious.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.780]   I mean, people didn't know much what was going on.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:52.060]   I park everything.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:53.780]   One night we were having for dinner.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.500]   I remember, you know, Emmanuel Mignot, who was, you know.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:59.660]   - He discovered the orexin-hypercretin relationship.
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:01.620]   That's the cause of narcolepsy is a mutation.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.100]   - Yeah, he was a friend of ours and his wife.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.780]   They were at home with our dinner and I was telling them,
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.340]   I was telling them that you could go to a computer
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:12.460]   and go through the Louvre Museum in Paris.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.780]   And they say, what are you talking about?
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:17.660]   So we finished dinner and we all drove to park at night.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.420]   And I turn on my computer and there was a man.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.540]   I still remember his name.
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:23.340]   Something Pioch was the last name.
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:26.140]   He had gone taking pictures of every painting at the Louvre
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:30.180]   and put them online so you could just navigate
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.020]   through the Louvre.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:32.420]   Today it's obvious, trivial.
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:33.780]   At that time, they couldn't believe it.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:36.580]   There you are in Palo Alto on an evening going
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.980]   through all the rooms of the Louvre.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.700]   They just couldn't understand what was going on.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.700]   - What year was this?
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.540]   - I don't remember.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.540]   But it was just-- - Must have been like '94?
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.460]   - When the web started coming, that was right before--
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.140]   - So we all had to get email in college
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.660]   in the final year of '97.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.580]   So it must have been somewhere around like '94, '95.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.380]   - Something of that sort, right before,
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.060]   right at the time Andreessen made the web available
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.140]   to everybody basically, Netscape.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:04.300]   So in any event, so it was an amazing thing.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.140]   It was amazing.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.900]   Now, all of these developments were really done
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.860]   in companies, not necessarily in academia.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:12.620]   - Okay, that is an interesting point.
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:15.060]   And I think that today, an immense amount
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:18.140]   of the advances that we see in biotechnology,
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:22.660]   in computers, in everything are essentially done,
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.620]   I would say, for profit by companies.
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:27.260]   Okay, I think social networks, they started,
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.060]   we started doing social networks at a time
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.700]   when no one even thought of doing it.
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.980]   I used to say I do social science with a capitalist
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.460]   because sociologists used to study the behavior
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:39.100]   of five widows in some Norwegian village and write a paper.
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.940]   We could look at 150,000 people,
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.700]   how did they visit this side or that side
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.340]   and predict how, you know, we were able
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:48.180]   to predict behaviors, behaviors, you know?
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.500]   So I think that today, everybody knows that that's the case
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:52.580]   and it's, you know, the same thing
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:53.860]   with artificial intelligence.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:57.020]   - But for a kid in high school or kids in college or kids,
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.300]   I mean, is it worth getting a graduate education?
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:00.740]   - Well, it all depends on what you wanna do.
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:03.740]   - I mean, law, medicine, you need a,
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.940]   I mean, you need the professional degree.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.860]   I mean, these are ultimately professional degrees,
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:08.740]   so you need the training.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:10.860]   I don't want a surgeon that didn't go to medical school.
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:14.100]   - Okay, but the danger is, and I remember a very,
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.860]   very bright guy I had in my team,
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:19.140]   you don't wanna become a blue-collar worker.
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:21.060]   See, what I'm saying is the following,
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:24.700]   being a hacker or being able to deal with software,
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.260]   it was an incredibly profitable profession.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.580]   Now you have these large language models
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.140]   that can actually program for you.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.460]   You need to write a program.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:35.340]   You go to Chad GTP and he'll write it for you.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:40.340]   So suddenly, if you don't have a set of talents,
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:43.020]   a way of imagining things or doing something,
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.420]   you become basically just someone that just hacks
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.700]   for so many dollars an hour.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.100]   Now, it's true that they can give you options.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.340]   If the company does well, you get rich and so on.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.420]   But I still believe that you need
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:59.060]   some contextual cultural part to this.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:03.420]   Okay, now I personally believe that humanities
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.140]   and all sorts of other things are very important.
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:08.100]   And to understand where is your cultural environment,
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:08.940]   where are you coming from
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:11.340]   and where is this society going is important.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.180]   But on the other hand, as you said,
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.500]   you can just finish high school and start hacking
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.140]   and become very good at it
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:19.060]   and doesn't require much more than that.
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:23.420]   - Do you think the examples of like Zuck, Elon,
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:29.820]   and others going from essentially departing
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.540]   standard education to start companies,
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.420]   do you think they've served?
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.940]   I mean, certainly not talking about the companies,
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:39.060]   but do you think those examples are good examples
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.460]   for people to internalize or are they unicorns?
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.140]   - Well, I think that they're unicorns
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.380]   and you have to be very careful.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:48.540]   We only talk about the success stories.
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.660]   We don't go and interview the guy
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.860]   that is loading a landscaping truck
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:56.220]   because his startup didn't go anywhere.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.660]   Okay, so it is a very,
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:01.180]   our tendency to see these people as heroes
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.900]   and to try to imitate them is a very dangerous one, I think.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.980]   Now, that doesn't mean that you should not be working
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.860]   on the things you care and gamble,
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:11.820]   but these are the guys who played a lottery and won.
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:14.740]   Do you remember there were many other social websites
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:18.820]   before Facebook and they all died
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.180]   and Facebook could have died too.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.820]   I mean, Zuckerberg might disagree with me,
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.900]   but he could have died, okay?
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.980]   And all these things are like that.
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:30.380]   Apple, when almost under, they brought Steve Jobs again
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:33.540]   and the guy put them onto the stratosphere.
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.220]   And the same thing with Elon Musk,
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:37.780]   he's a high-risk taker.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:39.820]   And so far, every time he flips the coin,
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.300]   he comes the right way.
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.700]   But to say, "I wanna be like him,"
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:47.300]   you have to be very careful and to calculate the odds.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:49.180]   Okay, so when you say this,
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:51.380]   how many of these kids really make it?
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.260]   I mean, it's a very complicated thing.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:56.020]   So I think that to have a strong background in something
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:59.020]   will help you when suddenly the field switches
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.060]   from being a programmer and making a lot of money
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.900]   to suddenly programming a dime a dozen
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:07.380]   or becoming a technician, basically, okay?
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.380]   - I mean, I had a perfectly thriving career
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:13.020]   as a lab scientist with grants and private funding
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:15.100]   and a bunch of other things, publishing regularly.
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.900]   And when I decided to switch to this, were you worried?
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:23.940]   - No, because I saw it as a very slow departure
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:25.260]   from what you were doing.
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:27.580]   And I saw the success very early on.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:31.020]   I mean, I realized that you were essentially satisfying
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.420]   two things that are very important to you.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:33.980]   You like to explain things.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.820]   You're incredibly good at explaining things
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.300]   since you were a little kid.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.660]   Okay, you were always explaining everything to people
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.500]   and you have a talent, let's face it.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.060]   I mean, you know, I'm not saying this
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.220]   because I wanna flatter you.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:46.340]   I really believe that and everybody says that.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:49.620]   The success of your podcast is a success at explaining things
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.500]   in ways that people understand.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.340]   They don't have to go and buy a book on neuroanatomy
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:55.100]   to understand what you're saying.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.460]   So I knew that this was a path.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.980]   Now, I didn't realize how incredible the path was.
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:01.420]   And there was a lot of randomness in it.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.460]   For instance, you started podcasting
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.620]   at a time when very few people were podcasting.
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:07.180]   If you start today,
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.460]   the story would be a very different one.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:11.140]   - The timing was the pandemic, people were home,
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.220]   they were listening to podcasts.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.820]   - And this brings to something to me
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:15.860]   that many times people have asked me about me.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.900]   What makes me do what I do?
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.300]   I believe in the idea of walking on beaches
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:24.380]   with very few footprints.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.460]   When you go into a crowded field, it's a mess.
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.660]   So many of the times that I move into something else
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:30.420]   is when I realize that there's a mob scene
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.860]   of scientists working at this
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.860]   and the chances of doing something interesting
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:36.740]   are very, very small, okay?
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:39.500]   The internet has allowed information to go everywhere.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.540]   A guy in Zambia can actually read the same things
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:43.780]   that I read here.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:46.460]   So it's very hard to compete against such a crowd.
[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:50.060]   And many people are brilliant and many of them are smart.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:52.420]   So you started something very early on
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:54.460]   and you were lucky that you chose a field
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.260]   that resonates with the needs of people, okay?
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:58.420]   There are also other people
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:00.500]   who do a podcasting and goes nowhere.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.940]   So I think that I never worried.
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:07.940]   I actually was elated to see the trajectory of your podcast.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:13.420]   The only thing is you have a tenure position
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:17.820]   and that is a nice safety cushion if everything else were.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.620]   Today you're beyond the reach of justice, as I say.
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:23.740]   So no problem, you don't need it in a sense, unless you-
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:25.180]   - No one's beyond the reach of justice.
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:27.100]   But yeah, I still maintain my tenured position.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100]   I spoke to my chairman in ophthalmology this morning
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.340]   and I'll teach this spring or in the fall.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:32.260]   - And it's good for you too,
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:34.100]   to really interact with young people
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:36.220]   and to hear what they care and so on.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:38.580]   But I never worried in the sense that I thought
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.300]   that you have enough talent to do well
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:42.940]   and you chose to do it.
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.860]   I mean, I remember during COVID at the beginning,
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.340]   we were at your sister's house
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.180]   and you were drawing all these little diagrams.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.740]   - I used to put my drawings. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:52.340]   And then, so I think you put them on Twitter
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:53.180]   or something of that sort.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.820]   And it was the beginning of something
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:56.780]   much more interesting and important.
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:58.900]   And so I never worried about it.
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:01.660]   I think that all of us, the whole family
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:04.580]   and those who know you are sort of impressed
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.300]   at the explosive success of the story here.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:09.260]   Your podcast is amazing.
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:10.940]   I mean, I don't have to tell you.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.260]   - That's what reflects a kind of an early compulsion
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.500]   more than anything of learn and teach, learn and share.
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.820]   - Yeah, but there's also, I need to say something.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:21.500]   The other day, actually, we were watching your interview
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.940]   with Esther Perel and regardless of the fact
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.820]   that I think it's a great interview,
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:29.100]   both my wife and I were reflecting on the fact
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.820]   that it's also an incredible tribute
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:32.860]   to the way you conduct an interview.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.980]   Okay, so there is a talent there.
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:37.700]   I mean, not many people can take someone
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:39.780]   and talk for, and make it interesting,
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.620]   let's put it that way.
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.460]   So you have that.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.020]   - I inherited your curiosity.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.140]   - No, but it's more than that.
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:46.860]   It's also a way of drawing people out and so on,
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:49.140]   which is also part of your practice.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.460]   So I never had any doubts.
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:51.420]   They are the opposite.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:53.220]   I mean, the issue is, you know,
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:56.140]   obviously you're taking it to many, many places
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.100]   long beyond what you started,
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.660]   which was essentially explain to people
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.140]   how neuroscience works, right?
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.100]   - Yeah, we've gone into a lot of health domains
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:04.940]   and other things.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:08.700]   And I'm also been blessed with an amazing team.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.580]   This is something that I think,
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:13.180]   while we share a lot of things in common, if I may,
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:17.900]   I mean, I've always been kind of a pack animal, you know,
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:19.940]   if it was skateboarding, like draw friends together,
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:22.140]   if it's birds, I have my bird club with Eddie Chang,
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:25.060]   who now, as you know, is the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF.
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.700]   It's kind of wild to think about,
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.340]   but yeah, I've rarely gone alone.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:31.500]   Like I'm just struck.
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.740]   I mean, we've had many conversations over the years,
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:36.980]   but I'm just struck at how you've been able to be,
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.860]   you've been a bit of a lone wolf
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:39.900]   with these different camps.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.220]   You make friends, you have colleagues,
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.100]   you maintain long-term relationships.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:44.460]   - I have groups of people who collaborate with me.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.140]   I don't do this alone, the opposite.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:46.980]   - Right, right.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:51.660]   But I haven't changed crowds very often, you know,
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:53.220]   and it seems like you've had to go into, you know,
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.460]   economics and theoretical physics and all these things.
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:59.900]   And yeah, that's an interesting difference.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:00.740]   And look-
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:03.260]   - And it's daunting and thrilling at the same time.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.620]   Sometimes when you start giving talks
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.980]   in a field that you've never done much before
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:09.140]   and you see this audience, you know,
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:11.140]   can be intimidating too.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.900]   You know, even when I started doing chaos,
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:14.420]   I thought I was doing very well
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:16.220]   till I gave a talk at Berkeley
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.380]   and there was a mathematician.
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:20.700]   I regard mathematicians as the top, top people in the world.
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:22.940]   And I was saying something and the guy,
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:24.620]   he's a very famous mathematician.
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.780]   He said, "That's a lie."
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:28.060]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.020]   He said, "Can you prove it?"
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:31.460]   "No, because you know, physicists don't prove theorems."
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:33.020]   He said, "Well, then it's a lie.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.500]   You cannot prove it's a lie."
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.740]   It was quite a, you know, a cold shower.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.700]   - That happens to me on Twitter every now and again,
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:40.340]   where they'll find something where I misspoke
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:42.140]   and they do it and it's super embarrassing.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:42.980]   You correct yourself, you move on.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:44.460]   - No, no, and then you learn things too.
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:45.300]   And you have a conversation with someone.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.940]   - And you never forget those things.
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:47.780]   This is what I learned.
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.980]   Like you never forget the errors you made.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:52.020]   Like on a qualifying exam,
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:53.700]   most people will never take a qualifying exam,
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:54.940]   but they basically ask you questions
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:56.380]   until you get something wrong.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.500]   The moment you say, "I don't know,"
[01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:58.860]   or you get something wrong,
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:00.580]   that's an important moment
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:02.540]   because it's also the thing that you go look up
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:03.660]   and you never forget.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.500]   - Yeah, right.
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.260]   And also the tiny humiliations can be very good too for you.
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:08.460]   I mean, this is very important.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.700]   - I've had plenty of those.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:10.540]   - I've had plenty of those.
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.380]   - I do too.
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.740]   I mean, I think it's a very, very important part
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:14.540]   of growing up and discovering
[02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.060]   that you don't understand something.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:17.700]   But I always, I need to say this.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:19.420]   I mean, in spite of the fact that you paint me
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.620]   as a lone wolf, I'm not.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:24.780]   I'm very social and I love interacting with people.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:27.060]   And I've always been very lucky
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:28.820]   that I surround myself with groups of people,
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:31.660]   including today, that are brilliant
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:34.340]   and resonate with the kinds of things I want to do.
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:36.740]   And so it's very stimulating.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.500]   I'm not the kind of person that sits in a corner
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.260]   and does theories and publish it.
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:41.860]   I publish papers on my own.
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:44.500]   That was my romantic period
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.780]   where I needed to be Einstein in the patent office.
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:48.260]   And not that I thought I was Einstein,
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:50.220]   but it was very important.
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:52.420]   I was the only author, okay?
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.300]   Today, I don't mind putting my name, whatever,
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:55.340]   and I don't need it.
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:56.660]   I mean, I have hundreds of papers
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:59.980]   and lots, you know, more than enough patents and so on.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:03.020]   So I like interacting with people.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.300]   It's very, very important to me.
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.740]   When I have an idea, I need to tell people about an idea.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:09.700]   So I can relate.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.540]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:11.540]   So that's very good.
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:14.460]   And I still see some of my old students and collaborators,
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:15.740]   like, you know, Ted and so on.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:17.780]   And we take walks every once in a while
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:19.020]   and discuss things, you know?
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:21.260]   And so I learned a lot from him too.
[02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:23.860]   - Right now you're working, as I understand,
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:25.580]   on quantum internet.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.780]   - Yes.
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:28.740]   - This is a mysterious term to most everybody.
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.180]   - Yes, yes.
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:33.220]   - You alluded to it earlier about quantum entanglement
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:34.060]   or about entanglement.
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:35.220]   - Yes.
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:38.940]   - But my understanding is that foreign governments,
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:43.260]   countries, and our government and country
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:45.460]   are very interested in quantum internet.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.300]   - Yes.
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.180]   - That it might actually be at least as important as AI,
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:53.940]   maybe more important for security reasons, et cetera.
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:55.540]   Can you explain quantum internet
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:56.780]   in a way that I can understand
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.620]   and the listeners can understand?
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.460]   - Yes, I can explain.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:00.380]   I mean, I'll tell you the original thing.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:03.420]   Quantum mechanics was essentially finished in 1925.
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:06.300]   So we're not reinventing new physics here, okay?
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:08.820]   There's the physics of the gravitation and quantum,
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:10.980]   but that's not really what we're talking about.
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:12.140]   What happens is the following.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:14.980]   The basis of all secure interactions
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:18.820]   in the internet on computers are based on the idea
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:22.140]   that there are certain mathematical equations or functions
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.660]   that are very hard to resolve.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:26.740]   So when I send you something encoded,
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:28.940]   if someone is listening to that conversation
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.500]   that is encoded and tries to read it,
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:32.860]   it's very, very hard to do
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:34.700]   because in order to decode that code,
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.660]   it's some kind of symbols and so on,
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:38.980]   you need to, I don't know,
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:42.420]   months or years of a computer to do it, okay?
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.380]   But it can be done.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.980]   Computers get broke,
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:48.140]   computer codes get broken all the time
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:51.940]   because the basis of these codes are mathematical functions.
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.460]   You have a mathematical function,
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:55.060]   you can create a computer program
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:58.420]   that will try to unravel it and it can be unraveled.
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:00.220]   Okay, so that's one thing.
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:01.860]   Now here comes quantum mechanics.
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:03.740]   Quantum mechanics provides security
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.340]   that is not given by mathematics,
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:09.260]   but by the laws of physics.
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:13.420]   So if you have a way of sending messages
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:15.060]   from one computer to the other,
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:17.460]   encrypted using quantum mechanisms,
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:20.220]   they cannot be broken.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:22.580]   - Can you give me an example of a quantum mechanism
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:24.220]   for encoding information?
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:27.300]   - Imagine that I'm sending you messages.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.100]   Every message is encoded in binary, ones and zeros, okay?
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:33.180]   So I'm sending a message which is a string of ones and zeros.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:35.420]   That string of ones and zeros could be hello, Andrew,
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:36.980]   or it could also be something, you know,
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:39.140]   that is secretly encoding to something.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:43.500]   If it's classical encryption, which is what we use today,
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.900]   a computer in principle can look at those symbols
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:46.980]   and unravel them.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.580]   Now let me show you how it works in quantum.
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:53.940]   In quantum, when I send you a quantum message,
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:58.940]   the act of touching it, trying to look at it, destroys it.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.460]   That's what happens in quantum, not in classical thing.
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:04.340]   I can look at the strings of ones and zeros,
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.660]   and I look at them, and I can make a copy of it,
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:08.300]   and then I read them, I take them to my lab,
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.580]   and I decrypt them, okay?
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:14.100]   If I look at a string of qubits, quantum bits moving,
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:16.140]   that are not ones and zeros, they are different things.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:17.340]   - These are moving parts?
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.100]   - Yeah, moving parts, they are usually photons.
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.420]   They go on, you can use fiber optics, you can use--
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.460]   - So these are photons, like, I know what photons are,
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:25.940]   so they're little bouncing energy of light?
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:28.300]   - Yeah, little bunches of light, because photons,
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:30.940]   if they're going around, they're also, you know,
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:33.580]   the photon could be polarized up or down or whatever,
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:35.540]   but if it's in a quantum state,
[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:36.820]   which is in the intermediate between,
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:39.740]   the moment I look at it, the moment I capture it,
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.940]   I collapse it into one or the other, and I destroy it.
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:43.580]   - The interaction with it changes it.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:45.140]   - The measurement destroys it.
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:47.260]   This is the mystery of quantum mechanics,
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:51.460]   that the measurement collapses, we call it the word,
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:53.180]   collapses into one state or the other.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.780]   Before that, it was anything.
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.340]   We could be anything.
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:59.460]   So when I use quantum signals, I'm sending qubits,
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.940]   quantum bits, they're called qubits.
[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:04.740]   The act of observing the qubit
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:07.260]   renders into a classical one or zero.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.660]   So then there's no way you cannot break it.
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:13.220]   - So does that mean that the practical implementation
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:18.220]   of this equates to unbreakable code?
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:20.300]   - Exactly.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.980]   - Which is why, of course, other governments,
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:25.740]   I mean, what I've been told is that in China,
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:26.820]   they're working very hard on this.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:27.660]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:28.860]   - And that here, we're working very hard on this.
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:29.700]   - We are working, I'm working too, yes.
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:31.020]   - Yeah, you're working very hard on this.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.140]   - Yeah, yeah, no.
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:32.980]   But wait, wait.
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:33.820]   - Who's there?
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.060]   Has anyone gotten there yet?
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:36.460]   - Okay, the problem is the following.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:39.060]   In order to decrypt this,
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:42.780]   remember that I told you that you can use mathematics, okay?
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.700]   Some of these functions are incredibly complex.
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.100]   It might take the age of the universe,
[02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:48.380]   perhaps, to decode them mathematically.
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.940]   Let's not talk about quantum,
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:52.060]   but if you have a quantum computer,
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.060]   now we're talking about a quantum computer,
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.460]   it can do it in a couple of hours.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.660]   A quantum computer could decode any mathematical function
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.940]   of the ones used in encryption in hours,
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.740]   whereas it would take the age of the universe
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.380]   for a monster computer,
[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:07.900]   standard computer you can buy, to do it.
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:11.180]   - So in theory, whoever gets this ability first
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:13.620]   can read essentially all the information
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:14.740]   that's being sent around the world.
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:17.540]   - Not only that, and many people are doing,
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:19.220]   the Chinese, the Koreans, and we're doing,
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:21.580]   they are grabbing everything now that is encrypted.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.500]   They cannot decrypt it, and they store it,
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:26.100]   because someday they'll be able to decrypt it.
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.820]   - But who knows if it will still be relevant?
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:29.860]   - Oh, but it may be.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:30.700]   - And we don't know what they have.
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:34.180]   - Imagine, imagine, imagine if you can get,
[02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:38.940]   remember when North Korea hacked, what was it, Disney?
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:41.420]   One of the, and then they discovered all these emails
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:43.700]   where people, like George Clooney, I don't know who,
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:45.540]   they was complaining about this or that.
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:47.180]   So imagine-- - And worse.
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:48.020]   - And worse, and worse.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:48.860]   - We just didn't hear about that.
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:49.700]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.940]   So if you grab all this information,
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:53.300]   we cannot decrypt it today,
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.100]   but if quantum computers become available,
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:57.660]   and there are people working on quantum computing,
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:06:59.260]   they'll be able to decrypt it.
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:01.620]   In the meantime, people are working
[02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:03.500]   on deploying these quantum networks.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.780]   We're working on that too.
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:06.180]   Not to deploy them, but just to see
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.660]   whether or not it's feasible to do that, okay?
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:11.020]   The Chinese are ahead of almost everybody.
[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:12.940]   They have two satellites already in orbit
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:14.700]   that are sending these qubits.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:17.420]   So these are impossible to decrypt, okay?
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:18.980]   - Wait, so they're sending the qubit,
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:20.940]   so you can already communicate in quantum.
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:22.980]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, we communicate all the time, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:25.340]   I have a lab in Colorado that does that, yeah, absolutely,
[02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:26.940]   over 100 kilometers, yeah.
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:29.020]   - But that's not what standard internet is using.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:30.420]   - No, no, no, no, but eventually,
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.060]   we will have a quantum internet based on all this,
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:34.900]   because in order to talk to these quantum computers,
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:37.500]   you have to send qubits, not just normal bits.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:38.980]   - So this is a race.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:39.820]   - Yeah, a race.
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.500]   We are not really, I mean, since we are not a, yeah, yeah,
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:44.820]   and there are a lot of people.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:46.340]   I need to tell you that a lot of people,
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:47.540]   including this government, that claim
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:50.740]   that this is not really that relevant or important,
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:52.140]   but in Europe, for instance,
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:54.100]   that they're really putting a lot of money into that.
[02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.180]   - Why would our government not think it's important?
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:08:00.340]   - Because there is a sociological phenomenon here.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:02.500]   Cryptography has always been
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:04.340]   the promise of the mathematicians,
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.900]   because there are mathematical functions,
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.540]   you know, like discrete logarithms and so on.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:11.140]   They believe, the moment they heard about quantum computers,
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.700]   they said, "Oh, we can solve the problem.
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:15.340]   "We can create algorithms, mathematical algorithms,
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.980]   "that are gonna be even harder to break."
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.020]   They call that post-quantum,
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:22.220]   but there is, they don't know it's true.
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:25.660]   The United States government is following this post-quantum
[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:27.660]   because they think it's easier and so on.
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:30.980]   Already, they published two of these very, very fancy,
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:32.460]   although two students with a laptop
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:34.300]   were able to decrypt it within a week.
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:35.740]   So obviously, you cannot prove
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.740]   that no one will ever decrypt these things, okay?
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:41.780]   So there is, the cryptographers, they don't like physics.
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:43.700]   They don't, you know, they don't work as physicists.
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:45.980]   So they say quantum key distribution,
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.500]   that's the name of this thing.
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:50.540]   Esoteric, it's not important, and so on.
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:52.100]   And also, it won't work.
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:54.580]   Well, they say it's gonna work for short distances,
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.380]   about 10 to 20 kilometers.
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:59.260]   We just published a paper that got tremendous publicity
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:01.380]   and an award and so on as best paper,
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:04.780]   that we were able to send this stuff over 100 kilometers.
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:08.580]   So I mean, and the Chinese are sending that from satellites,
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.580]   okay, so impossible to decrypt.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:12.940]   Military communications, based on these kind of things,
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.500]   are impossible to decrypt.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.100]   So they are very important.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:18.300]   But there is a whole group of people
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:21.100]   that are saying, no, post-quantum is what we want.
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.980]   And so NIST, the National Institute of,
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:25.260]   I think, Science and Technology,
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.060]   they are really pushing the post-quantum thing.
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.340]   In Europe, it's the opposite.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:32.580]   They're really embracing quantum.
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:34.100]   I mean, I was, Denmark, for instance,
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:35.820]   is very far ahead into these things.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:37.860]   NATO just gave them a pile of money
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:39.420]   to work on quantum and so on.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:42.260]   So it all depends, you know, it's a complicated thing
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:46.500]   because the crypto people are all mathematical people.
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:48.580]   So they don't care about quantum.
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.820]   - Is any of this going to be useful
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:55.420]   for trying to understand, I don't know, how the brain works?
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.780]   - Well-- - Or is it, I mean,
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.900]   you know, there's still debate as to whether or not
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:00.740]   the way that we're thinking about brain function
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.620]   is even, like, the right way.
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:06.900]   We think about neurons, action potentials, and chemicals.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.340]   But the physicists, whenever they kind of, like,
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:11.300]   poke their noses into this stuff,
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.700]   they tend to think about it a little bit differently
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:16.020]   or they start to think about, well, you know,
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:18.500]   state dependence, like, the brain that you have at 8 a.m.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:19.780]   is very different than the brain you have
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:21.580]   at 2 a.m. or 4 in the afternoon.
[02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.220]   Like, maybe everything's happening differently
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.740]   and maybe some of this actually gets down
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:25.900]   to the quantum level.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:29.300]   Like, we can't say this neuron talks to this neuron
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:31.620]   and when they talk in the following way,
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:33.220]   you get a certain output.
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:34.540]   Like, is there relevance here?
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:35.900]   - Okay, there are two things I want to say.
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.420]   Beware of physicists getting into brains, in brain work.
[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:40.260]   I mean, they always end up--
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.740]   - It's like the new thing now.
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.580]   - Yeah, I know, I know.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.340]   - Neuroscience, you know, has swung the doors open.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:45.900]   - I was into neuroscience for a while.
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.180]   - Yeah, and I think recently, neuroscience has made
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:50.820]   a good move of including people from psychology,
[02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:54.780]   computation, even philosophy, economics, and biology,
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:57.260]   basically all levels of analysis.
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:01.020]   - But the other thing you asked about quantum and the brain,
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.140]   there is Roger Penrose,
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:04.380]   who just got the Nobel Prize in physics.
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.180]   He's one of the few people who have very esoteric ideas
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:09.500]   about the brain being totally quantum.
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:11.380]   And he's an incredibly brilliant man.
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:13.020]   He was the advisor of Hawking.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:14.660]   - Yeah, I heard him on Lex's podcast.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:16.060]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:18.060]   - And yeah, he does have interesting ideas
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:21.420]   about how neurons might be communicating,
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:24.500]   maybe as bound networks as opposed to independent entities.
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.500]   - But no one really follows it,
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.700]   and I'm not an expert in that.
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:31.300]   So, Roger Penrose is the one that's pushing this.
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.660]   Many of the physicists go into brain science
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:37.300]   are not very clever at doing brain science,
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:39.580]   because, you know, I heard a story,
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:42.340]   I think it was Francis Crick or someone who told,
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.420]   I was at a conference and he was saying this,
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.820]   that a physicist came to him and said,
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:48.980]   "I decided to go into brain science."
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.580]   And so he said, "Okay, what have you done?"
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:51.420]   And the guy says,
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:53.180]   "I measure the specific heat of the brain.
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:55.220]   "What do I do with it, basically?"
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.300]   - I think it's good that computationally minded people
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.420]   have joined neuroscience,
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:01.260]   because it was getting too modal, too descriptive.
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:06.260]   That said, I do think that, you know, math is so important,
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:09.780]   but it's often used to intimidate biologists
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.020]   into thinking that their ideas either might not be true
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:14.060]   or that there's better ideas out there.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:17.980]   I will say that when computational neuroscience first started
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:20.140]   it seemed like the attempts to model the brain
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:21.300]   were pretty feeble.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.860]   And actually, I'll just say it, they were pretty lame.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:27.700]   But now, I think with AI and LLMs,
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:28.780]   - Oh, that's a whole different story.
[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:31.860]   - Like the biologists have had to step back and say,
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:36.860]   "Hey, you know, these math, physics, engineering AI types,
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:39.940]   "they have the potential to really evolve the field."
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:40.780]   - Right, right.
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:41.620]   - At least that's my stance.
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:44.020]   - I was at conferences where people say things like,
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:46.660]   "The brain is a massively parallel machine."
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:48.460]   And I say, "Wait, wait, are you sure of that?"
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.780]   - Yeah, that's a meaningless accent.
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:52.620]   - Yeah, so I said, "If I show you a row of trees,"
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.180]   and I said, "Tell me how many are they,
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:55.300]   "do you really take the whole thing?"
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:58.180]   And he said, "75, or you have to go sequentially."
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:12:59.820]   It's not parallel, it's sequential, you know?
[02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:01.660]   - But LLMs are pretty interesting, right?
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:05.820]   I mean, you can take four or five large language models,
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.620]   essentially sort of pseudo brains,
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:09.380]   and have them work on the same problem.
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:11.220]   It's hard to work with five people in parallel
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.460]   in a way that's coherent, right?
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.780]   You can only talk so much over one another.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:16.620]   - It's very interesting.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:17.860]   That's exactly what we're doing now.
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:20.460]   Years ago, with Jeff Frager, we wrote a paper
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:23.620]   on the idea of showing how programs collaborating
[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:26.020]   with each other could solve problems very, very fast
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:28.300]   that humans and others cannot do.
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:31.060]   And it's a basis of a lot of the work we want to do now.
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:33.660]   Yes, and there are people who are already thinking
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.740]   of putting many, many of these LLMs together,
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:37.500]   and then see whether or not they do better
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.580]   than a single one, or better than a human.
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:43.060]   - So you think AI is going to improve life
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.140]   for the typical citizen?
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.420]   - Yes, because you can use these things
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:50.100]   in order to do things that were very hard to do before.
[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:51.860]   I mean, I use them, and it's amazing.
[02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:53.860]   I mean, I just, we just published a paper
[02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:55.740]   on hallucinations in LLMs, and so,
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.300]   because they hallucinate every once in a while.
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.460]   They say anything.
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:01.060]   But yes, yeah, they are very useful, very useful.
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.740]   And I think that the companies that use them
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.180]   will make more money than the companies
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:07.460]   that produce them, like OpenAI, and so on.
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:10.300]   Yes, yeah, it's a very, very important field.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:12.980]   - But 10, 15 years ago, whenever I'd bring up AI,
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:14.980]   you would chuckle and say, "This stuff is life."
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.660]   - Well, the funny thing is that the other day,
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:18.940]   well, I don't want to name him,
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:22.380]   one of the managers at Xerox, but when I was at PARC,
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.460]   I started playing with the idea of using machine learning
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:25.620]   to see what they can do.
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:28.620]   And the AI people at that time said, "That's nonsense.
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:30.180]   "We need to think about logic.
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:31.980]   "How does the brain think?
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:34.300]   "How do we do cognitive psychology, and so on?"
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.100]   We were just doing neural nets.
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:37.420]   That's exactly it.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:39.700]   And the other day, I was meeting with some of these people,
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:42.260]   and they were saying to me, "We used to laugh at you,
[02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:43.580]   "you know, doing this stuff,
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:45.140]   "because we could do only very little."
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.740]   And today, it's the rage.
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:48.380]   Now, the difference between what I was doing
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.700]   and what is being done today is the scale.
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:52.340]   I mean, you know, I don't know if you know
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.660]   that they are now using nuclear power reactors
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.700]   in order to power the data centers.
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:57.540]   - I didn't know that.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.660]   - But it's an immense cost of computing.
[02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:02.060]   You have no idea the amount of work it takes
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.900]   to one trillion tokens in order to get
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:06.820]   one of these things to work.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.460]   - It strikes me you've always been very open-minded
[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:13.820]   and very willing to adopt new technologies,
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:16.780]   but it hasn't changed your daily life very much.
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:18.540]   Like, not much at all.
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:21.940]   I remember early on, you said, you showed me the internet,
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:23.580]   and you said, "Be very careful."
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:24.420]   And I said, "Why?"
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:25.980]   You said, "It's like mental chewing gum."
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.100]   - Absolutely. - You chew and chew.
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:27.940]   Those were your words.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:30.900]   You said you chew and chew, and at first it tastes good,
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:32.660]   then it doesn't taste very good at all.
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:34.380]   Then you don't taste it at all.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:36.900]   And then you realize there's no nutrition.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.740]   And I always think about that in terms of phone usage
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:42.420]   or web foraging behavior.
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:43.500]   - Yes.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.860]   - And you still like to work.
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:49.380]   You take a walk in the afternoon or after eating.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:54.860]   You've always been incredibly regular with your routine,
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:57.220]   despite the evolution of all these technologies.
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:59.260]   Like, you're not the guy in Silicon Valley
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:01.020]   who's like tricked out with all the gear.
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:01.980]   - No, no, no.
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:02.820]   Well, there is another--
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:04.220]   - Actually, I've never seen you at a cafe
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:05.260]   with a laptop.
[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:06.100]   - Well, sometimes.
[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:07.980]   But, well, there's another aspect to this.
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:11.540]   As you know, in the last, up to five years ago,
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:14.060]   I spent four years working on the economics of attention
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:15.940]   and why is it that people attend to things.
[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:18.460]   And I really believe, and I'm not an expert,
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.980]   that there is a tremendous resonance between these machines
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:23.820]   and our human brains, and they are addictive.
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:26.540]   The former CEO of Hewlett-Packard,
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:29.700]   where I was direct in the labs, Meg Wickman,
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:30.740]   she used to say, you know,
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:33.460]   "I wake up in the middle of the night to look at my phone,
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:34.700]   "and I know people who do that.
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:37.100]   "And there are members of my family who do that more often
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:38.380]   "than I would like to see them do that."
[02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:39.380]   - You don't do that?
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:40.220]   - No.
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:43.500]   I mean, I do it, but I don't have this compulsion
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:44.740]   to see what's going on.
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:47.300]   I had a student that he said, "I love spam
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:49.020]   "because at least something is happening."
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:49.860]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:50.940]   - He said that.
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:51.780]   - Spam?
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:52.600]   - Spam.
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.880]   He said, "I get spam and I look at it
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:56.660]   "because something's happening," he used to say.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:59.140]   He's now a very successful financial guy.
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:00.220]   Stop doing that.
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.660]   Brilliant fellow, brilliant fellow.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:03.780]   - But that's because maybe your internal world
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.860]   is rich enough that you don't, I mean-
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.180]   - No, but I look at news.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.620]   I like to look at things.
[02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:09.460]   I look at videos.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:10.300]   Don't misunderstand me.
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:14.360]   It's not that I ignore it, but yeah, I'm not, I mean,
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:16.540]   I mean, I like the latest things and so on,
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.420]   especially if they are beautiful and so on.
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:21.420]   But yeah, I'm not into whatever the latest is and so on.
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:24.020]   And I remember I got some Oculus things
[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:25.340]   that I got for free- - VR.
[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:28.700]   - I gave them to you and I never used them once or twice.
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:31.020]   - I'm not, I mean, I've used VR in my lab,
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:33.960]   but I don't want to spend time in VR.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:36.260]   - And also as my conversation
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:38.620]   with one of your collaborators here revealed
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:42.080]   before this podcast, I love mechanical things
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:45.260]   and the details, the analog world, okay?
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:46.900]   So yeah, digital is interesting
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:48.340]   and it's fascinating in some ways,
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:52.180]   but I like things like mechanical watches,
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:54.780]   cameras that click when you press them and so on,
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:56.820]   but not artificially, okay?
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:58.340]   So I really like that.
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:17:59.940]   I like things that are very classical
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:02.320]   and so on in many ways, and I enjoy that.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.300]   I like technology, don't misunderstand me,
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:06.020]   and I use it a lot.
[02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:09.500]   And I use it and I do new things with them
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:10.740]   and I get patents and so on.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:14.300]   But yeah, I'm not a techie guy in the same sense.
[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:18.900]   I enjoy, I like to have an analog life, not a digital life.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:22.300]   Riding a bicycle is analog, walking is analog,
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:24.240]   sitting and meditating is analog.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.620]   Of course, you can also listen through the internet
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.580]   to a good thing that helps you meditate
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.780]   or go to sleep, don't misunderstand me.
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:36.420]   But I don't have this fascination with things and so on.
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:38.060]   I mean, some people do, but-
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:40.120]   - It seems like a lot of people have a fascination
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:41.500]   with the future.
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.300]   You seem very grounded in the present.
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:46.220]   - I've never read a single book of science fiction.
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:48.820]   Most of the people I work with, and I admire them,
[02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:51.220]   they all come with ideas from books and science fiction.
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.860]   They always say, "Did you read this or that?"
[02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:55.260]   And I say, "I have no idea."
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.100]   I never liked it.
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.700]   I like to read about real people
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.380]   with real blood and real feelings.
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:02.900]   Science fiction, to me, is devoid of that.
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:05.460]   It's imagining droids doing this or that.
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:06.500]   I couldn't care less.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:08.980]   - 'Cause I always think that physicists
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:10.860]   must love science fiction because-
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.420]   - Never, never, never read a single book
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.740]   or looked at it in a movie or science fiction.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:16.780]   I couldn't care less.
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:18.100]   I don't relate to that.
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.380]   I don't think that these people display
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.740]   human-like behavior anyhow.
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:24.420]   So, I mean, I'm not saying that it's not interesting
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:25.260]   to others.
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.100]   - But you're not a futurist.
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:29.220]   - No, no, even though they call me a futurist
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:30.780]   because I always anticipate things.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:33.460]   - Right, but you're not somebody who thinks
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:35.820]   about what life is gonna be like 100 years from now.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:38.540]   - No, no, I like to know life is now.
[02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.260]   Yes, yes.
[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:43.060]   And I also, as Niels Bohr once said,
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:46.180]   "It is hard to predict anything, especially the future."
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:48.340]   Okay, we all predict the past very well.
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:49.540]   I don't know what's gonna go.
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:51.340]   I mean, we've seen things happening,
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:53.420]   indeed, unbelievable things.
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:55.500]   I mean, the technology that allows you
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:58.340]   to become such a worldwide known phenomenon
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:19:59.900]   is because of the technology.
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.740]   Imagine if you were just declaiming
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:05.820]   the Roman Senate centuries ago.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:06.660]   Very few people--
[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:07.660]   - I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now,
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:09.180]   but with no microphones or cameras.
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:10.020]   - Right, okay.
[02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:12.020]   So, yeah, I'm not a futurist, and that's it.
[02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:15.740]   The people tell me I am because I anticipate things,
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:19.620]   but not because I imagine a world in which, you know,
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:22.780]   I couldn't care less about going to Mars, for instance,
[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:25.580]   even though Elon Musk thinks this is very important.
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:27.940]   - Do you think it's a cool project?
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:28.780]   - I don't know.
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:32.660]   I wanna ask him why, and then he tells me things,
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:35.100]   like he says things like, "Well, you know,
[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:36.700]   "civilization is gonna die here.
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:38.900]   "We are gonna asphyxiate," and so I don't know.
[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:41.140]   I mean, let it happen, I don't know.
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:43.020]   Just enjoy now, you know?
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:45.060]   - You're not worried about the future?
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.020]   - In that sense, no, I'm an optimist.
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:48.660]   I believe that technology will solve
[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:50.540]   the global warming problem, everything.
[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:52.220]   It's obvious how to solve it.
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.100]   There's nothing very mysterious, you know?
[02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:56.340]   Nuclear power is gonna do it, you know?
[02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:57.180]   Absolutely.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:59.900]   - And once we get over our preconceived notions
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:00.740]   of nuclear power.
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.780]   - Right, but I mean, very few people have ever died
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:04.940]   of a nuclear accident, let's face it.
[02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:07.060]   - Yeah, they need to name it something else.
[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:07.900]   - Might be, yeah, might be.
[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:12.740]   - Like many things that at once were thought to be dangerous
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:16.900]   when renamed, you know, turn out to not be so dangerous
[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:18.460]   when renamed, people are willing to adopt.
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:19.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:22.020]   - So, yeah, I don't really, you know,
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:23.860]   I don't worry too much about the future.
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:26.660]   I think that people are ingenious and wise enough
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:29.420]   to stare away from the brink, hopefully.
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:31.540]   - You don't seem to worry too much generally.
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:33.180]   You're not a big worrier.
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:34.780]   - No, yeah.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:35.940]   - You and I are different that way.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:36.780]   - Huh?
[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:37.620]   - You and I are different that way.
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:39.340]   - Yeah, you worry a lot, yes.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:41.860]   - Not if I keep busy.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:43.420]   - Oh, okay, yeah.
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:44.580]   - These days, a lot less.
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:47.540]   I think that, I think at the transition points
[02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:52.180]   between different circumstances and at the transition points
[02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:53.220]   between different career things,
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:54.540]   I think it makes sense to worry.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:57.700]   It sort of drives some of the urgency to make sure that,
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:02.700]   you know, you reach for the next rung and grab it, right?
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.500]   And not, you know, not miss.
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:07.940]   I mean, there's been, I think there's been elements
[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:10.900]   of uncertainty in my life where I felt like,
[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:12.980]   okay, I'm gonna ground the things I can control,
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:15.700]   but no, I don't stay up at night worrying about things.
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:17.620]   - Yeah, also, I think meditation
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:20.100]   is profoundly effective at this.
[02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:22.540]   Suddenly, you're here, and that stays.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:23.580]   The past is the past.
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:25.460]   You cannot do anything, and the future hasn't arrived,
[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:27.420]   so what the heck, you know?
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:30.820]   I really believe that, and it has helped me immensely.
[02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:32.980]   I'm very, the few things I'm very proud,
[02:22:32.980 --> 02:22:35.780]   I went for my medical checkup a year ago,
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:38.620]   and the doctor says, "I'd love to hear you breathe."
[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:40.420]   I said, "What's so wrong with my breathe?"
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:42.100]   He said, "It's so slow and calm."
[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:44.380]   - So you got over the white coat syndrome?
[02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:45.340]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:46.260]   - Because of meditation.
[02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:48.100]   - Yeah, you sent me your lab results this morning,
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:49.900]   so everything looks great.
[02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:50.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:53.620]   - But you've always been regular about exercise.
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:54.540]   Not excessive.
[02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:55.380]   - No, no.
[02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:56.620]   - You're never one of the marathoners
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:59.700]   or the 5 a.m. in the pool people, but no.
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:03.300]   - I tried runs to run a marathon, actually, so.
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:06.060]   - Yeah, I mean, it's very common in the area where,
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:09.260]   and around Stanford, to be pretty extreme about athletics.
[02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:10.260]   That was never your thing.
[02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:11.100]   - No, no.
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.140]   - Steady, long-distance running.
[02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:14.220]   - Yeah, I told you that once.
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:15.380]   I'm not a sprinter, yeah.
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:17.980]   Some people are, and by the way, I admire them immensely.
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:18.820]   - You mean in life?
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:19.660]   We're speaking metaphorically.
[02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:20.500]   - Yeah, in general, yeah.
[02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:22.100]   There are some people who really can do things
[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:24.300]   incredibly fast, and they move from one thing to the other,
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.660]   and so on.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:29.140]   Yeah, I like people who reflect some wisdom.
[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:30.540]   For instance, I have a,
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:32.300]   it's very strange for someone like me,
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:36.020]   but I see a Buddhist monk, and I just suddenly,
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:38.260]   I feel calmer by just seeing that person.
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:40.820]   I don't know.
[02:23:40.820 --> 02:23:42.940]   There is something, it's not just the spirituality,
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:47.380]   the power they have to be here, totally and absolutely.
[02:23:47.380 --> 02:23:48.460]   It's impressive to me.
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.380]   I mean, some of the people say,
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:52.220]   "Okay, he has funny robes," or something.
[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:53.300]   I like that a lot.
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:56.300]   It's not necessarily a way, I mean,
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:59.980]   my therapist used to state to me that to use meditation
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:04.980]   to move away from trouble and troubling thoughts
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:08.420]   is not a good idea, so you have to embrace the world, too.
[02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:11.420]   But I use it so as just to stay calm and to enjoy
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:14.460]   and to see things for what they are, and I think, yeah.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:16.580]   Yeah, the future is the future, I don't know.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:18.660]   - Well, you can only control what you can control.
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:20.620]   - Right, but there are some people
[02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:22.860]   that worry all the time about the future.
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:26.940]   - Given your understanding of quantum mechanics,
[02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:30.020]   relativity, and the real world,
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:34.740]   and perhaps just generally knowing what you know
[02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:36.980]   and experiencing what you've experienced,
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:41.980]   do you believe in some sort of higher power organizing force
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:45.500]   or let's just be blunt, do you believe in God?
[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:49.020]   - Well, okay, the word God has a lot of implications, right?
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:51.700]   I mean, I don't necessarily, I don't believe in a God
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:54.820]   that keeps track of what you and I are doing at this point.
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:58.020]   There are too many people, and so on,
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:01.940]   so I don't believe in this notion of an agent there
[02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:04.700]   that is somehow knowing what everybody on this planet
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:06.620]   is doing, and so on.
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:09.780]   I do feel sometimes, and especially because
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:14.260]   of the studies I have, and actually from reading people
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:16.140]   who have been very, very deep, you know,
[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:17.460]   in particular the thoughts of people
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:19.540]   like Einstein, Heisenberg, and so on,
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:21.620]   that there seems to be at times a sense
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:23.940]   of an organizing principle in the universe,
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:27.020]   and to learn those rules, so there is this notion,
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.060]   I mean, philosophically, it's called pantheism,
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.100]   that God is in nature already.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.540]   Spinoza and all these people studied this.
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:36.540]   That is very appealing to me, the notion
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:39.460]   that there is something, that this thing is,
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:41.300]   if it's evolving, it's like an entity,
[02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:45.620]   but not an entity that says, oh, tomorrow,
[02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:47.380]   you know, you'll die, or so on.
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:49.460]   I mean, you'll die, you'll die, there are lots of events
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:52.460]   that lead to death or to happiness, and so on,
[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:54.660]   but not because someone is out there checking.
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:57.420]   I mean, I don't believe there is enough memory
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:25:59.700]   to store all this, although today I saw,
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:03.260]   you can buy a SanDisk memory terabyte study this big.
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:07.180]   So I don't believe in that, but it's a matter of belief,
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:09.060]   not anything else, and unfortunately,
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:11.020]   these beliefs are translated sometimes
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:12.580]   in complicated action.
[02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:15.020]   I do believe that there is a sense of mystery.
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:20.580]   Sometimes, I once heard, I don't know who said it,
[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:23.140]   but it's a very good sentence that if you listen
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:26.540]   to Beethoven say, I mean, the man struggled,
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:29.380]   but it's amazing he was able to create that music.
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:31.300]   On the other hand, Mozart seems to have been getting
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:34.260]   the messages from heavens, you know, on a daily basis,
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.420]   just wrote it down.
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:38.140]   So some people are given this connection
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.460]   to something much bigger, and you have access to that
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:44.300]   through listening to that music, the experiences we have.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.220]   - There is this idea out there that consciousness
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:48.180]   doesn't just exist within our brains,
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:50.980]   but as sort of like a collective network,
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:53.300]   and things come through us, not just as individuals,
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:54.140]   but as humans.
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:56.740]   - Jungian thing is a lot of that.
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.220]   I'm very interested in the word spiritual
[02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:02.420]   and what it means, you know, to see that things transcend
[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:04.860]   our particular needs at any point.
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:08.780]   But the idea of a God that tells you one thing or the other
[02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:11.340]   is funny, you know, if you look at any movie,
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:13.020]   you know, "Braveheart" or whatever,
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:16.700]   you see that one group of warriors has a priest saying,
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:18.980]   "God is with us," and the other one is about to engage
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:21.220]   and says the same thing to the other group.
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.460]   That's a little bit funny, right?
[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:25.900]   - Well, I think humans and human brains in particular
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:29.860]   are amazing, amazing what human brains can do.
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:32.580]   This computer in our heads is spectacular,
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:34.020]   and yet it also has limitations.
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:37.100]   And I think, well, put differently,
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.420]   does it make you nervous or worry you
[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:43.060]   that I seem to have an increasing interest
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.300]   in God and religion?
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:47.900]   - No, I think that it's a beautiful journey
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:48.740]   in which you're in.
[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:50.820]   And there are two pieces to this,
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:53.500]   provided you don't start using this
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:56.700]   to somehow spout arguments
[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.060]   why people shouldn't do this or that.
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:00.500]   - No, no, it's only my own exploration of my own life.
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:01.340]   - I respect that.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:03.740]   I think it's a very important thing.
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:06.940]   You know, there is an issue here that I read,
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:09.060]   reading Wilson, actually, E.O. Wilson,
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:11.660]   which, you know, he wrote this beautiful book
[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:12.500]   on human nature.
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:14.180]   And he claims that the religious instinct
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:16.700]   comes out of a submissive component in us
[02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:17.780]   that animals have.
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:19.100]   Dogs are submissive.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.060]   And we believe that we need to be submissive to a king
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:23.660]   and to something beyond a king, you know,
[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:25.180]   some deity or something.
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:26.180]   That's his theory.
[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:27.620]   - I certainly don't feel any compulsion
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:29.420]   to be submissive to other humans.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:31.340]   I mean, I think in knowing the limitations
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:32.740]   of the human brain and cognition,
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:34.180]   I don't care how smart,
[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:37.980]   I don't care how successful an individual or a group is,
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.340]   that it's very clear that the human brain is limited
[02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:42.700]   in parsing the universe that we're in.
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:43.740]   Otherwise, we wouldn't continue
[02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:45.140]   to have the same issues over and over.
[02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:47.260]   Although I do like to think that we're falling forward,
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.260]   we're evolving forward,
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:50.340]   as opposed to devolving as a species.
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.980]   But we tend to repeat a lot of the same mistakes
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:54.780]   over and over again.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:56.700]   - There's also a technical thing here.
[02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:58.900]   We sometimes confuse randomness
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:01.420]   with premonition or God doing something.
[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:05.020]   I mean, dodging a bullet by turning your head,
[02:29:05.020 --> 02:29:08.180]   as our next president did, is an incredible thing.
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:10.780]   The probability is so, so, so small.
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:13.260]   But that doesn't mean that there was someone
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:15.380]   who said, "Turn your head, do it,"
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:16.420]   and so the bullet would pass.
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:18.500]   I mean, we ascribe causality
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:20.060]   to something that was truly random.
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.140]   It could have also, in another scenario,
[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:24.220]   the same turn of the head would have been to the other side
[02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:26.220]   and this person would be dead.
[02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:28.740]   So I, but sometimes we are confronted
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:31.460]   with these incredible coincidences
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:32.780]   that we cannot explain.
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:34.580]   And we say, "Oh, it must be God
[02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:36.380]   that made sure that you and I met
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.900]   or that we thought the same thoughts," and so on.
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:42.380]   - Although as a biologist who started off
[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:44.940]   as a neurodevelopmental biologist,
[02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:46.820]   I think I just had to see,
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:49.100]   there are two things that changed my understanding
[02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:50.540]   of what might be possible.
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:52.420]   One was Barbara Chapman, my advisor,
[02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:54.500]   once treated me to an experiment.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.380]   It was kind of a funny thing.
[02:29:55.380 --> 02:29:57.820]   Typical Barbara, you know how nerdy she was.
[02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:01.220]   She said, "Are you willing to stay up all night?"
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.620]   And I was like, "Okay, yeah."
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:06.540]   And she took zebrafish eggs and fertilized them.
[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:08.780]   And I sat for 11 hours with food.
[02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:09.860]   I got up to use the restroom
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:14.860]   and I watched a zebrafish egg duplicate and become a fish,
[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:19.100]   like in real time with my eyes.
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:20.380]   Not some movie on YouTube,
[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:21.420]   although that's impressive too.
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:22.840]   People can look these up.
[02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:25.740]   But to just actually see life emerge from a set of cells
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.380]   through its own organizing principles,
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.460]   all of which can be explained by genes,
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:33.100]   transcription factors, the physics of the mitotic spindle,
[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:36.300]   all, I mean, math and biology and chemistry
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:37.860]   can explain all of it.
[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:39.900]   But there was something truly spectacular about it
[02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:42.700]   that seems so non-random because it's not random.
[02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.980]   And then the other one is that,
[02:30:44.980 --> 02:30:46.660]   I mean, I guess I've had enough experiences
[02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:51.560]   with prayer and the consequences of prayer in my real life
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:54.180]   that I just, I sort of can't get my head around the idea
[02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:57.660]   that there's not a God or some sort of organizing force.
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:30:59.920]   I just, I can't accept it because there's,
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.300]   yes, there's causality, reverse causality,
[02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:04.780]   correlation and mistaking correlation and causality,
[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:07.540]   but somehow, like, I mean,
[02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:10.840]   I like to think I'm grounded in science and reality,
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:13.860]   but I don't think science can explain it all.
[02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:16.020]   - Oh, no, and I think that this experience
[02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:18.660]   of this spirituality, for instance,
[02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:20.740]   I remember, it still happens,
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:23.420]   spending a night outdoors and looking at the sky.
[02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:24.820]   I mean, it's an incredible thing,
[02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:27.380]   the stars and you feel so small,
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:29.580]   and yet there is order to all that.
[02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:30.980]   It's not just random stuff.
[02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:32.740]   I mean, they move according to laws
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:35.580]   that fortunately we humans were able to discover,
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:37.260]   which is an amazing thing when you think about it.
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:38.860]   Dogs did not discover gravity.
[02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:40.980]   - No, certainly not Costello.
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:42.460]   - Okay. - Costello was gravity.
[02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:46.220]   - Yeah, so I really think that there is something
[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:48.420]   to be said about these spiritual experiences,
[02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:50.540]   and I really believe that, very importantly,
[02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:52.260]   and I listen to people talk.
[02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:55.140]   I recently have been looking at some stuff that C.S. Lewis,
[02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:59.480]   you know, he was a man who was studying the sagas
[02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:01.860]   and the mythology of the Vikings and so on,
[02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:04.220]   and eventually became a devout Christian,
[02:32:04.220 --> 02:32:06.580]   you know, thinking that this was the only answer to the,
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:09.220]   because all religions have the same element.
[02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:11.120]   So I understand that.
[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:12.460]   I respect it.
[02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:15.740]   I experienced that, you know, at times in my life.
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:17.860]   But when I think seriously about it,
[02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:19.700]   I think that the moment, you know,
[02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:21.980]   we have this computer and, you know,
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:24.700]   we can get glimpses of all this,
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:27.900]   but I don't believe that it's this notion.
[02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:30.500]   No one can prove to me that there is someone there
[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:34.020]   organizing my life minute by minute or second by second.
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:35.360]   I don't believe that.
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:38.060]   I do believe that there are fantastic chances in life
[02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:40.820]   and randomness, beautiful ones, okay?
[02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:45.100]   And, you know, having you and Lara as children
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:47.420]   is a fantastic randomness in my life.
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:48.820]   - Hopefully it wasn't too random.
[02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:50.860]   - No, no, in the sense that, you know, children,
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:54.020]   you know, children that come unhealthy, whatever.
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:56.260]   I mean, you know, it's a very impressive thing.
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:58.100]   - Yeah, the number of things that have to organize
[02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:02.180]   to create a healthy child is, it's truly a miracle.
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:03.660]   - Yeah, true, true.
[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:06.780]   Yeah, and I think, but a lot of it is random too, you know?
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:08.700]   I mean, the same set of parents
[02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:12.180]   can produce two different set of children too, okay?
[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:13.020]   I mean, that's a very, very important--
[02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:15.060]   - Well, Lara and I are pretty different.
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:17.500]   - Oh, absolutely, but in very beautiful ways too.
[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:21.100]   So, I mean, neither of you does behave
[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:24.260]   or conducts a life that, you know, I would be unhappy,
[02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:26.220]   your mother would be unhappy with, so.
[02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:27.660]   But going back to this,
[02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:29.740]   I believe that, indeed, spirituality is important.
[02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:32.540]   I have a lot of access to that through classical music.
[02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:35.340]   There are times that I really believe that is it.
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:38.460]   I mean, I can get very, very emotional listening to music,
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:40.900]   very emotional, you know?
[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:43.220]   My wife always notices it when I do that.
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:45.820]   And I think that then you are having access
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.140]   to something very different.
[02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:49.180]   Of course, it can be explained physiologically
[02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:52.300]   by all sorts of resonances and so on, but who cares?
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:53.780]   You know?
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:56.400]   - You mentioned that you can peer into the future
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:58.600]   with ideas that you're working on,
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:02.220]   and yet you don't get too far ahead.
[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:04.060]   Like, you're not thinking like 100 years from now,
[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:05.080]   what's it gonna look like?
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:07.720]   Do you spend a lot of time thinking about the past?
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:09.540]   - Sometimes, sometimes.
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:14.260]   There is a, I've always, because I left my family
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:16.260]   when I was still very young,
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:20.220]   I always had a certain nostalgia for things, okay?
[02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:24.660]   I met a, I became friend with a very impressive guy
[02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:26.020]   in France, Claude Jopard.
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:28.580]   I think he was the director of the Geophysics Institute,
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:31.160]   and both of us had very similar parents
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:33.420]   in different, you know, French and Argentina,
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:35.560]   but still, and similar educations.
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:39.580]   And we had, I have sometimes a certain nostalgia
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:42.660]   that is almost melancholy about the way we grew up
[02:34:42.660 --> 02:34:43.500]   and so on.
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:44.320]   - Melancholy?
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:45.160]   - A little bit of that.
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:46.000]   I mean, I--
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000]   - I recall your stories about growing up in Argentina,
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.580]   like you would have 10, 15 cousins over
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:51.740]   for lunch every Sunday.
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.580]   - Yeah, yeah, it was very happy--
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:53.420]   - That doesn't sound melancholy.
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:56.020]   - No, no, but there were moments, moments of loneliness,
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:58.980]   moments of times where I felt very misunderstood.
[02:34:58.980 --> 02:35:03.620]   I had, unfortunately, a very punishing mother,
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.800]   so that, but I still remember her,
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.000]   and I think about her in ways
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.680]   that are not necessarily always very happy.
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:12.200]   I was looking at photos a while ago,
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:14.000]   and I, there are pictures of her that is, you know,
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.240]   she's smiling coming out of the Pacific Ocean in Carmel.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:18.840]   She took a walk and so on.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:22.120]   But I reflect back in the past in that sense.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:24.560]   I mean, and sometimes, you know, I'm asked, you know,
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:26.320]   how did you grow up?
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:29.120]   My wife being Danish, she grew up in a very different way
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:32.400]   from, you know, upper middle class Argentines.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.080]   So, you know, we reflect on that, you know,
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:37.560]   the kinds of childhoods we had and so on,
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:39.880]   but not in the sense that, you know,
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:41.340]   oh, I wish I had that now.
[02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:43.680]   - No regrets?
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.480]   - Well, not many, not many.
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.920]   - That's good.
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:49.720]   - I mean, there is one regret
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:51.480]   that is more theoretical than anything else,
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.040]   which is if I look at my family,
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.440]   my brother stayed, produced family,
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:58.840]   children, grandchildren, and so on.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.640]   I came here, and I produced children, grandchildren,
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:02.840]   and there are going to be two diverging branches
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:03.660]   of the family.
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:05.640]   - I wish that we still get together.
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:07.280]   We got together last year for your birthday.
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:08.120]   - Yeah, no, I know.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.760]   That's what is so important to me, yes.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.120]   But I think about it sometimes.
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:14.240]   And when I go back and I see the lives
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:16.000]   very similar to what I had, or, you know,
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.600]   different perhaps, there is a certain, you know,
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:20.400]   sense of thinking about the past.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:25.240]   But I also realize that if I didn't take the steps I took,
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:27.760]   I would be as miserable as some of my old friends
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:29.880]   that are really struggling even to find meaning
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.680]   in what they do, or even surviving economically.
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:34.480]   So, I was really lucky.
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:36.600]   - Well, so was I, 'cause I wouldn't have existed,
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:37.440]   'cause you wouldn't have met my aunt.
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.920]   - That's true too, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:40.160]   - I mean, maybe you would have, but--
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:41.000]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.760]   - But I'm grateful I didn't grow up in Buenos Aires.
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.640]   I love the city, I love the country, but--
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:45.480]   - I don't feel that--
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:47.680]   - I couldn't have done any of the things I've done
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:49.560]   in South America, given, maybe,
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:51.040]   but the landscape was just completely different.
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.120]   - Oh, I go there, and after a week, I want to come back.
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:54.600]   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:55.920]   - So, you love this country?
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:56.840]   - I love this country.
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.400]   I feel very much part of this country.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.960]   I'm very grateful to what this country has done for me,
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:03.240]   for my family, and that includes you and your sister,
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:04.280]   okay, and my wife.
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:05.480]   - When did you become a citizen?
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.760]   - Oh, many, many years ago.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:09.320]   And I really did it consciously, not because,
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:11.000]   I mean, there were practical things,
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.320]   but no, I really believe in it.
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:15.240]   I really believe it's an incredible country,
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:18.160]   and it gives incredible opportunities to people.
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:21.040]   As Elon says, Elon Musk, I'm also an immigrant,
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:22.600]   and very happy to be one.
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:24.280]   - Yeah, you've always been a patriot.
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:26.640]   - Absolutely, and on the other hand, as I said,
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:27.920]   Argentina's complicated.
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.200]   I go there, and a lot of smells and things
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:32.720]   that, you know, bring memories that are amazing.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:33.560]   - Food's not bad either.
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:34.400]   - I mean, huh?
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:35.240]   - The food's not bad.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:37.920]   - Yeah, yeah, but it's also the whole atmosphere.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:40.880]   And the first two, three days are an incredible experience
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:43.880]   of meeting friends and talking with them and so on.
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:47.800]   But after a while, I also see a darker side to it.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:49.520]   I must tell you that, on the other hand,
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.280]   my country-in-law, Denmark, is also a country
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:54.440]   that I like immensely.
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:58.320]   There's nice people, and pleasant, and soft, very soft,
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:59.800]   especially in summer. (laughs)
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:01.840]   - But the Danes are also strong people.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:06.560]   Like, the average Dane is so smart.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.040]   I think the high school education there
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:09.440]   must be among the best in the world.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:12.080]   - Yeah, there is a notion of proficiency.
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:14.480]   I mean, people are proficient at what they do.
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.600]   Yeah, you go to a store, you go to,
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:19.360]   you have a problem, an airline or whatever,
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:21.680]   you'll get someone who really knows how to solve it.
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:25.120]   But there's also a very, it's a small society,
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:28.560]   very homogeneous, tremendous sense of humor, which I enjoy.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:31.000]   And it's very soft.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.360]   People, you know, enjoy life.
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.560]   They have notions like slow food movements
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:35.800]   and things of that sort.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:36.640]   So I like it.
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:39.000]   I could not live there because it's, you know,
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.200]   it's a very homogeneous way of behaving.
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:43.280]   You know, the Lutheran ethic is there.
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.920]   They're not religious, but they're Lutheran.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.000]   So I feel very comfortable in Europe and so on.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.800]   But I like being here, yes.
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:53.960]   - Yeah, I feel like our family now
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:56.400]   includes so many different nationalities
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.040]   and religions and backgrounds
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.160]   and philosophies and political stances.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:02.000]   - Well, it's good too, right?
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:02.840]   - Yeah, it's great.
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:04.720]   It's starting to look like the UN with some extra.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:06.040]   - Well, I grew up in a family
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:07.680]   that had an ideological diversity.
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:09.280]   It was incredible, incredible.
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:10.120]   - That's good.
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:12.560]   - Yeah, so that was also good to be, as a child,
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:15.160]   to hear these arguments about politics and so on, you know?
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:16.680]   - Yeah, I hear a few of those now.
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.520]   - Yeah.
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:18.360]   - Arguments about politics.
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:19.480]   We won't get into politics.
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:21.120]   One thing that I did want to say, however,
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:24.200]   is that I remember a long time ago,
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:25.840]   and I'm certain 'cause I wrote it in my journal,
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:30.240]   you said, "Politically incorrect views are often right."
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:32.120]   Is that true still?
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:33.160]   - Yes, yes.
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:34.520]   - Still true for you, I should say?
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:35.960]   - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:40.640]   Because this has only to be judged in time, okay?
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.040]   I think that the issue of politically incorrectness
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.440]   is some kind of a mob behavior
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.160]   that says you should think like us, okay?
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.680]   We should be able to express our views.
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:52.720]   We're respecting others and so on,
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.600]   and we should be respected for that.
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.200]   I think that this whole notion
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.400]   that others are telling you what to think or not to think
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:00.720]   is a little bit complicated.
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:02.000]   And I must say something,
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.960]   which I hope it doesn't get me in trouble
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:06.960]   with my Danish side of the family or friends.
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:09.360]   Societies like the Scandinavian societies
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:12.080]   that are extremely uniform in thinking,
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:14.600]   the word "should" is used all the time.
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:18.280]   Yeah, you should do this, you shouldn't do that.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:19.840]   Good that you did it, you know?
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:22.440]   It's a very, they enforce behavior
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:24.320]   in a very, very particular way.
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:25.520]   It's not a hurting instinct,
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:29.480]   but there is a very, very strict Lutheran tradition
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:32.120]   of telling you what you should and you shouldn't do.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:35.160]   So I know very few people,
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:37.320]   and I've been going to them for many, many years,
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:39.400]   that really have iconoclastic ideas
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.680]   that are away from the mean,
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:44.680]   and they're considered odd, okay?
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.360]   Very few, including the physicists.
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.760]   And they have fantastic school of physics there.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:50.840]   Niels Bohr was there.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.440]   So it's a society that conformity is the issue there, right?
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.360]   So on the other hand,
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.480]   I think that it's good to think differently.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:01.960]   And, you know, there's a man, perhaps you heard of him,
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.840]   I know, I mean, I admire him.
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:05.280]   He died, Freeman Dyson.
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:08.320]   He was on a level with Feynman and Engelman, by the way.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.320]   He used to have very strange ideas too.
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:12.440]   He used to say, "Global warming, what's wrong with it?
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:14.200]   "The Sahara is gonna be a garden."
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:18.840]   Yeah, you know, the Sahara Desert will become a garden.
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:20.320]   People will be able to eat all that food.
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:21.320]   - Well, I think people hear that,
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:23.880]   but then they counter it against these, you know,
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:26.720]   very heart-wrenching pictures of like polar bears
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:28.800]   on ice caps that are shrinking, this kind of thing.
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:30.120]   - There are more polar bears today
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:32.040]   than when Mr. Al Gore said that we're gonna die.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.040]   - Listen, I'm not gonna argue climate change with you
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:35.680]   because I have no knowledge there.
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.520]   - No, no, I'm just giving you a bit of-
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.840]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not countering.
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:40.640]   I'm just saying, you know, like,
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:44.560]   I mean, this is getting very intense on the internet now
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:47.680]   because the arguments on both sides seem pretty strong,
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:49.480]   at least as they're presented.
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:50.760]   So who's right?
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:52.400]   - No, the question is, what can we do about it?
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.280]   That's the issue, and I think that technology
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:56.720]   and wisdom are gonna solve it.
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:41:58.920]   I think so, I really believe that very strongly.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.680]   I'm an optimist when it comes to that.
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:02.960]   But what I'm talking about being politically incorrect
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:05.840]   is this idea of saying things that a group of people say
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:08.240]   you shouldn't be saying or thinking those thoughts.
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:10.880]   And the question is, can we debate those things rationally
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:13.960]   or nicely, respecting people's beliefs, okay?
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:16.320]   And I, yeah, I believe in that very strongly.
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.240]   And I think being politically incorrect
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:23.240]   is a way of saying you're sort of, you're smiling at them.
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:25.640]   But it's okay, why not?
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:27.080]   You know, it's a, you know,
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:28.960]   who said that we shouldn't be like that?
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:30.960]   I remember encountering the first libertarians
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:33.720]   when I was already, you know, working as a physicist,
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:36.480]   and they were saying to me, why should we,
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:39.360]   why are we, why are we afraid of the Russians?
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.600]   I said, well, you know,
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:42.920]   well, you think they're gonna invade the United States?
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:44.480]   Can you imagine Russia invading?
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:46.400]   I mean, if they invade it, how are they gonna control us?
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:47.960]   You know, they had these arguments.
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:49.640]   They were very funny arguments, you know?
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:51.080]   Why do we need an army?
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:52.360]   Why do we need taxes?
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.840]   And I really thought that was so provocative,
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.400]   it was so interesting.
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:58.000]   - Do you consider yourself a libertarian?
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.680]   - In many ways, I like the idea of liberty.
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:02.000]   I believe very strongly in it.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:03.920]   I mean, this country was founded on that.
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:06.360]   I think that our founding fathers really believed in it,
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.440]   and I admire them for that.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:11.280]   I, you know, reading Jefferson and so on
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.240]   is really inspiring to me.
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:15.840]   I think that some of the political movement
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:17.360]   is a little bit odd.
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:19.840]   They always end up with political candidates
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:21.280]   that go nowhere and so on.
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:22.120]   - Why do you think that is?
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:23.320]   - Huh? - Why do you think that is?
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:25.000]   - I think that they're-- - If they're so rational,
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.280]   they're often among the smartest people in the room.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:27.520]   - But they are not the most,
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:29.800]   they are not strategically smart.
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:32.440]   I've met at times libertarians that think,
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.600]   you know, incredible thoughts,
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:34.600]   and you know, they work in,
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:36.760]   they live in Silicon Valley, and they're poor.
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:38.000]   I mean, even though they are the ones
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.840]   who are supposed to know-- - Some are poor, some are--
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:41.120]   - Some are not, but I'm saying,
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:42.680]   it's very interesting.
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:43.960]   They choose presidential candidates
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:45.440]   no one ever heard of.
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:48.760]   - I think many of them are, you know,
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.520]   they are on the spectrum in a way
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:53.760]   that doesn't allow them to get into the minds
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:56.440]   of other people in a way that would allow them
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:59.280]   to convince other people about their arguments.
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:01.480]   I mean, a lot of politics, as we know, is show business.
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:02.560]   I mean, in this recent election,
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:04.240]   it was all posturing.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:05.960]   It was all about grabbing emotion.
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.960]   It was not about logic, it was about emotion.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:09.880]   - Yeah, I have several of my people that,
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.880]   you know, they put all their money to freeze themselves.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.080]   - You're gonna cry over yourself?
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:15.000]   - No. (laughs)
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.720]   - My dad and I have had this running joke
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:19.200]   for a lot of years because someone we know very well,
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.760]   and several people we know well,
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:22.800]   have set aside significant amounts of money
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:25.200]   to have their heads or entire bodies frozen
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.080]   on the idea that they're gonna be brought back later,
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:29.000]   Han Solo style.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.840]   You've always laughed at this idea.
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:32.280]   - No, but not only that,
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:33.760]   there's a colleague of mine at Stanford
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:35.880]   who accuses me of being friends
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:37.400]   with a guy that is like that.
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:39.080]   And I told this guy, I said, you know,
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:41.240]   he thinks that you're a bad influence on me.
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:42.840]   And the guy said, well, tell him
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:44.520]   that we are the ones who are gonna come back
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:47.200]   and do what we believe, but he's gonna be gone.
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:50.400]   - You're not interested in living to be 200?
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.240]   - It's not the issue.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:53.720]   These people are interested in living for another 1,000 years
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:55.840]   so when they wake up, they see how the world looks.
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:57.080]   They read science fiction.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:58.680]   So they are very interested to know
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.960]   what the world looks like once they wake up.
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:01.800]   So, okay.
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:02.760]   - Well, there are people in the health space
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:04.360]   that are trying to not die,
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.720]   you know, Brian Johnson and others.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:06.680]   - That's a different story.
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:07.720]   - Yeah, I mean, what's your thought
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:11.040]   on trying to live to be 150 or something like that?
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:13.720]   - Well, if you can live, the issue is not the age,
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.000]   it's the conditions of your body and mind, okay?
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.240]   That's the issue.
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:19.960]   I had the misfortune and unfortunate
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.000]   of having two parents that lived very long lives.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]   One was incredibly, my father,
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.160]   was incredibly lucid until the end.
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.560]   My mother had everything, you know,
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.840]   all every dementia and complications
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.240]   that came from, you know,
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:36.560]   being an anorexic all her life and so on.
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:41.040]   So my father enjoyed being lucid until the end.
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:42.440]   And so he, you know,
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:44.560]   he didn't take care of himself physically so well.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.600]   So the idea is if you live up to 100 or 150 or 200
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.640]   and you can still do the things you enjoy in life
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:51.120]   is one thing.
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:54.000]   To be like my mother who couldn't even comprehend
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.600]   what was in front of her when you put a cup of tea,
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:57.920]   you know, then it's very sad,
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:00.320]   but it can happen at the age of 35, you know.
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:04.520]   So, yeah, I'm not into a race to live forever.
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:06.640]   I want to live healthily.
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:07.560]   I want to enjoy life.
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:09.560]   Enjoyment is the most important piece.
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:11.520]   What's the point of being, you know,
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:14.240]   tethered to tubes all over the place?
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:16.400]   You know, flat on a bed,
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:18.520]   and you say, "Oh, I made another year of my life."
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:21.000]   I mean, that's not really a life, at least for me.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.040]   - Do you worry about or,
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.800]   and/or wish for anything for me, for Lara?
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:28.920]   - Yes.
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:30.440]   To be super happy people.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.240]   No, I don't want to use the word happy.
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:34.320]   I want to see you joyful.
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:37.000]   Joy, joy is more important than happiness.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.880]   Joy is a state of mind.
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:40.320]   Happiness is, okay, yeah,
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.600]   I set a list of things I want to have,
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:44.640]   and I have them, and I smile a lot.
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:47.080]   Joyfulness is this sense of being in yourself,
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:48.480]   and I would like that.
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:50.200]   I mean, you two are very different.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.160]   Lara lives much more in the moment than you do,
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:55.720]   for reasons, okay, it's her view of it.
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:56.560]   - It's her demeanor.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:57.400]   - Huh?
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:46:58.240]   - It's her way. - It's her demeanor.
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:46:59.080]   It's very good.
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:00.800]   - I'm focused on what she's going to do this weekend.
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:01.640]   - Yes.
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:03.040]   - I'm focused on what I'm going to do this weekend,
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.880]   next week, the next month, and for the next month.
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:08.080]   - I would personally like to see you enjoying today
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:09.560]   and this weekend, and that's it,
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:11.440]   and everything else is going to come to you.
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:13.560]   I believe, and now I'm speaking in a way
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:15.360]   that is more paternal than anything else,
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.000]   I think you have a charmed life,
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.080]   and everything came to you since you were very little,
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.920]   and you exhibited behaviors and so on
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:28.880]   that everybody was even smilingly impressed with you
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.320]   from the very beginning.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:32.160]   I mean, it's not that you were a genius at chess
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:33.840]   or a Rubik's cube or anything.
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:35.520]   I know some kids that are like that,
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.480]   but there was something, something in there.
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:42.280]   And so I think that learning to just relax and rest,
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:44.040]   but it's part of your behavior.
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:46.960]   Since you were little, you had these problems, okay?
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:50.080]   I used to put you on my lap and say, "It's going to be fine,"
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:51.800]   and say, "Well, what if I cannot do my homework?"
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:53.520]   Okay, but you could.
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:54.800]   - Or even my stuffed animals.
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:56.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the same.
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.040]   That gave you tremendous--
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:57.880]   - Needed to be organized.
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:47:58.700]   - Yeah, it was tremendous.
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:47:59.540]   - Well, I probably have,
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:00.840]   remember I had the grunting tick?
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:02.040]   - Yes, yeah, oh, yeah.
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:04.960]   - That was, drove us nuts, yeah.
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:08.800]   - Well, I probably have a little bit of an OCD type thing.
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.680]   I mean, not diagnostically significant,
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:15.680]   but when I bite down into something that I'm pursuing,
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:18.160]   it's very hard for me to think about anything else.
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.000]   - Well, we talked about it when you were at Berkeley,
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.720]   once you told me that you were starting to run,
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:23.840]   but you wanted to run like everybody else was running,
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:25.320]   I don't know, how many miles.
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:26.960]   - Yeah, no, I heard there was a guy
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.700]   who had been in the department, Randy Nelson.
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.160]   He's now a professor in Ohio.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:33.640]   Somebody just like off, you know, just in passing said,
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:35.000]   oh yeah, you know, Randy worked, you know,
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.640]   in like 80 hours a week or 90 hours a week.
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.240]   And I was like 95 hours.
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:40.080]   - Yeah, I'd remember that.
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:41.040]   - You know, but what's interesting
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:43.200]   is I'm not a naturally competitive person.
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.200]   It was just this idea, like I've tended to want to know,
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:49.000]   and I've since stopped this,
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.040]   but there was a long time where I wanted to figure out
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:53.520]   what my body and mind were capable of.
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:56.240]   I just wanted to see like, how high is that ceiling?
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:00.320]   And it was only when I almost suffocated on a scuba dive
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:03.480]   or when I was working to the point of exhaustion or,
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:06.560]   you know, or, and then I also realized that, you know,
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.080]   I published a number of papers to get tenure.
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.960]   Like I didn't need that many, but I enjoyed every one.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.280]   It's not like I'm not having fun, I'm having fun.
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:15.440]   - Yeah, this idea of pushing oneself to limits,
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:16.440]   the question is why?
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.960]   I mean, I think there's so much to enjoy on a regular life
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:23.140]   and the things that we have already,
[02:49:23.140 --> 02:49:25.820]   we have to work to get them the way we want.
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:28.640]   But I don't think that worrying for the sake of worrying
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.920]   or just worrying, I mean.
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:30.840]   - Yeah, I don't tend to worry.
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:33.720]   Well, you know what changed that for me in a major way?
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:35.820]   I mean, I've had moments, I've had moments.
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:38.960]   I think I can recall, like I have a favorite,
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:40.560]   best day of my life moment.
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:43.280]   I won't share it here, it's not relevant right now,
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:46.840]   but Costello helped bring me into the moment.
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:48.240]   Like he would do these things that like,
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:50.640]   I would delight in that were just so simple.
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:53.280]   Like the way he would like fall over or something,
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.540]   or, you know, I think that like having another creature
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:49:59.220]   there that is very much in the moment
[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:00.460]   brings you into the moment.
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:02.140]   - Right, and you are very connected to it too.
[02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:04.540]   I mean, I think that if you were connected to someone
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:07.020]   that has that property of bringing you down and so on,
[02:50:07.020 --> 02:50:08.440]   you will start enjoying it.
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:11.740]   - Yeah, the people I've had amazing partners, as you know,
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:14.260]   some less than amazing, but many amazing partners,
[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:18.700]   and they tended to be also kind of into the future,
[02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:20.980]   like focus on what's not quite there yet.
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:22.960]   - But I must say, I think women in general
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:24.680]   do it better than men,
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:26.720]   that they're better at like grounding to the present.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:27.560]   - Well, it depends.
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:30.180]   I think that my wife tends to be more anxious
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:31.020]   than I am about the future.
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.800]   - So maybe it's not general.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:35.040]   - Well, in trying to sort of, you know,
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:37.840]   tell her that she shouldn't worry so much,
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:41.000]   I think that I also suddenly reflect, what am I doing here?
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.360]   And I try to also slow down myself.
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:45.120]   I think that, you know, yeah,
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.520]   I think you're someone who's running from one thing
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.920]   to the other, I mean, to say colloquially,
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:52.800]   but it would be nice if you said, okay, I'm fine.
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:55.540]   You know, you have a podcast that is doing well,
[02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:56.880]   you don't have to worry what the podcast
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:58.520]   is going to be doing in five years.
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.480]   - No, I don't think out that far.
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:02.000]   I don't think about the career piece.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.160]   I think that I, I mean, I often don't have a plan.
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:07.880]   I know what we're going to do this year.
[02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:09.460]   I don't know what we're going to do after that.
[02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:12.120]   But professionally, I think, look,
[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:13.360]   I think part of it was science.
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:14.900]   I mean, we're talking about a lot of things,
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:17.440]   but for many years, right,
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:19.240]   from the time I like squared my life away,
[02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:21.120]   and when I turned 19, it was like, okay,
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:22.780]   I'm going to get things right now.
[02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:24.440]   There's always been these milestones.
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.240]   You're going to finish your undergraduate degree.
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.840]   I did a master's, then you do the PhD,
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:29.520]   then the postdoc, then you're going to need to get tenure.
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:32.840]   You know, I think the academic system
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:36.840]   was a system of two to five year bursts,
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:41.160]   like sprinting marathons in many ways to try and,
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:43.240]   you know, grab the next thing to get to the next level.
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:45.680]   And there was a lot of uncertainty for a long time.
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:47.520]   You know, I think I'm finally now coming
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:50.180]   to a place of certainty, like feelings of like,
[02:51:50.180 --> 02:51:53.320]   oh, like things are good and they've gone great.
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:55.440]   But yeah, but it's hard.
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:56.440]   - Oh, of course it's hard,
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.000]   especially if you have that kind of temperament.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.920]   Yes, and I think you need to train yourself almost to,
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:06.080]   I just had a set of the words that are,
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:09.240]   it's a matter of bringing elegance into your life almost,
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:11.040]   to live it in a way that is elegant,
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:15.760]   is nice in itself, you know, that is important.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:18.760]   One of the things I learned, I mean, you know,
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:22.200]   living with a Dane, Danes don't like you to eat standing.
[02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:26.200]   They sit a table and they light a candle and, you know,
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.360]   it's very nice, it creates a pace.
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:29.280]   - Yeah, the ritual.
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:31.200]   - The rituals, rituals are very important.
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:33.040]   And also the other thing that is very important
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:35.360]   that I discovered is to have something to look forward to.
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:38.440]   You cannot just wake up one day and say, and now what?
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:40.040]   There has to be something.
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:41.200]   Okay, that's important.
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:43.120]   I mean, you know, we all have that.
[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:45.440]   - So Rogan talks about this thing about, you know,
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:48.640]   because he has a podcast, he does four episodes a week,
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:50.280]   plus he's an announcer of the UFC,
[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:52.480]   has his comedy career, he has three kids,
[02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:54.400]   he's in a happy marriage and, you know,
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:55.840]   he's really into working out and all this.
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:57.840]   And he, I heard something recently,
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:01.080]   it was actually the forward to Cameron Haynes' book.
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:03.520]   I was listening to it and he, it was amazing.
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:06.720]   He said, you know, you have to approach your life
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:11.720]   no matter how busy or how simple as a kind of work of art.
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:13.960]   Like you can't just think of it as daily life.
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:17.360]   You have to have some macroscopic view of this
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:19.400]   so that you know where to put things.
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:21.480]   And it's a lot of what you're saying as well.
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:22.600]   - Elegance, yeah.
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:23.920]   Life has to have elegance.
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:26.560]   Otherwise it's just disjoint moments.
[02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:28.120]   And so sometimes they will be like that
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:30.000]   and it can be very creative too.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:34.840]   But most of the idea is to really get into something.
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:37.520]   I mean, I personally think that when you describe me
[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.480]   as being very steady or whatever,
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:42.200]   sounds very boring too for that matter, right?
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:43.040]   I mean, yeah.
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:44.880]   I mean, there's a beauty in steadiness
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:49.640]   because from places of steadiness, you can take good risks.
[02:53:49.640 --> 02:53:50.480]   - Well, right.
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:55.400]   I mean, and I think that my mind is not in a steady state,
[02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:58.360]   but I don't have this notion, I have to see things.
[02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:00.480]   Everybody's talking about something, I have to see it.
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:01.800]   I never felt like that.
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:05.000]   No, I mean, I'd like to see things, don't misunderstand me.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.440]   But it's very important for me to be in the moment
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:09.360]   and do things the way I like them to do.
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:12.560]   - Yeah, you don't seem to need to go on like jungle adventures
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:15.160]   or like ice skate across Antarctica.
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:19.080]   Like you've never been one for like the kind of wild outing.
[02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:21.840]   - No, no, the wild outing is here.
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:23.120]   That's my wild outing.
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:27.120]   Yeah, I can have very wild thoughts about things
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:28.000]   that I would like.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.560]   Sometimes they're totally wrong and so on.
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:32.120]   But yeah, in a funny way,
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:34.640]   I am a little bit of what the French call an armchair,
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:36.080]   a philosopher or whatever.
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:39.160]   There are these people who write articles about France,
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:41.920]   if Africa would have never having left France
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:43.200]   or something of that sort.
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:44.240]   So I'm not like that.
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:49.240]   But I don't necessarily crave this physical adventure
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:51.160]   for the sake of adventure.
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:52.600]   I like beautiful things.
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:54.720]   And I don't mind repeating the same beautiful thing
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:57.120]   every year if necessary,
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:59.160]   going vacation to the same places and so on.
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:00.840]   - Yeah, you'd like to go back to the same place.
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:02.480]   - Well, there is a difference between tourism
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:04.240]   where you see new things and so on.
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:05.080]   I like that.
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:07.080]   There's also the idea of vacation,
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:09.240]   where you just sit and enjoy what you have.
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:14.840]   - I confess I've not ever done it.
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:16.600]   And you know this about me.
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:18.440]   I've never taken a vacation.
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:20.080]   - You should go to the summer house in Denmark.
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:22.840]   You can spend a week there just enjoying it.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:23.840]   That's it.
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:25.800]   I don't know if I show you pictures from the window.
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:28.280]   They see the deer in the garden.
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:29.280]   They just sit there.
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:30.840]   It's nice.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:33.160]   So there's nothing, it's nice.
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.880]   It can be, you cannot spend a life doing that.
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:37.560]   I'm not a monk, okay?
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:39.880]   I'm not a meditator that will spend hours on this,
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:41.960]   but it's nice to rest.
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:43.680]   It's very important, I think.
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.320]   - And the rituals are important to you.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:46.880]   - Very important, yes, yeah.
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:49.640]   The rituals also are very reassuring
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:51.440]   because then you know it's predictable, right?
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:54.120]   You don't want a totally unpredictable life all the time.
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:55.760]   That's why people create rituals.
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:01.800]   - You early on taught me about etiquette.
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:06.240]   It's something that years later,
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:08.440]   I think it was probably in the mid nineties,
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:10.600]   for some reason, we were at the movies together
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:12.240]   and we saw some people at the movies
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:15.960]   and they were wearing their bathroom slippers
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:19.280]   and more or less their pajamas to the movies.
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.720]   And I'll never forget, you grabbed my arm.
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:23.000]   Like you didn't grab it forcefully,
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:24.920]   but you grabbed me and said, "You see that?"
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:25.760]   I said, "Yeah."
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:27.200]   And you said, "People are coming to the movies
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:28.560]   in their pajamas."
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:29.400]   I said, "Yeah."
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:31.000]   And you said, "That's the beginning of the end
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.640]   to any society."
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:34.280]   And I thought you were joking,
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:36.960]   but it's something I thought about a lot.
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:40.880]   You also said, and I'll never forget,
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:43.520]   "You're always better off being overdressed
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.760]   because then at least your class that you're speaking to
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:49.200]   or your hosts, et cetera,
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.880]   they know that you took them seriously."
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:56.880]   And I don't think we really appreciate etiquette.
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:58.800]   As Americans, especially,
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:01.600]   we've somehow confused freedom of choice
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:03.680]   with discarding etiquette.
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:07.560]   Yeah, it's not something that you hear discussed very much,
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:09.760]   but what about etiquette?
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:11.800]   - Well, there are many components.
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:14.200]   I think the most important one is a societal one.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:15.880]   I mean, one of the things that I like,
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.040]   for instance, if you go to England,
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:19.440]   how polite people are.
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:21.240]   Politeness is a virtue.
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:25.520]   And politeness, they hire the social class,
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:27.720]   they hire the demand to be polite.
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:30.800]   It's behavior, it's being nice to people,
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.480]   it's understanding what they are.
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:34.760]   And associated with that, there are codes.
[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:38.000]   Some of them are behavioral, some of them are dress codes.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.080]   I had a brilliant economist,
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:41.680]   the Italian economist working with me,
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:43.480]   and now he's in the East Coast,
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:45.880]   who told me he went to a wedding in Italy
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:47.320]   after living in the United States,
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.440]   and he went to his cousin's wedding,
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:52.320]   and his uncle said, "You show no respect.
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:54.040]   You're not wearing cufflinks."
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:55.400]   He said, "Well, but my shirt is all..."
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:57.240]   "No, no, no, go home and get cufflinks
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:59.320]   because you're showing lack of respect
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:01.920]   for not dressing the proper way to this wedding."
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:03.640]   So I think that there are expectations
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:06.000]   that people have about certain kinds of behavior.
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:07.400]   I mean, if you look at, say, the pictures
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:09.640]   of what's going on now in Washington and so on,
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:11.920]   you notice that Mr. Elon Musk,
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:14.120]   who's always in a t-shirt that says, "Let's go to Mars,"
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:15.560]   suddenly he's wearing a tuxedo
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:19.360]   because, at least now, he's part of a group of people
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:22.040]   that are behaving like government officials should behave.
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:23.880]   You don't go in sandals and shorts.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:25.320]   - But Silicon Valley is famous
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:26.680]   for the flip-flops and the hoodie.
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:29.000]   - Right, because the problem is that people confuse
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:33.160]   the style with the message.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:34.640]   They think that because you wear a hoodie
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:36.720]   because Mark Zuckerberg was wearing hoodies
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:38.840]   makes you brilliant, okay?
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:41.480]   And I think that the issue of dress codes
[02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:44.960]   elicit a certain sense of behavior in people, as you said.
[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:46.880]   I mean, you know, how would you feel
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:48.520]   if you went on a first date with someone
[02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:51.720]   that comes in in her, you know, slippers
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:54.000]   and a bathrobe and say, "Let's go to the movies."
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:55.480]   - It's not happened yet.
[02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:58.000]   - Well, okay, but, okay, so what I'm saying is
[02:58:58.000 --> 02:58:59.800]   you don't have to overdo it.
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:01.000]   You know, that's another issue.
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.920]   And you have to also conform to the rules of the society.
[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:06.080]   I noticed, for instance, that in the East Coast,
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:09.240]   people dress much more properly than in the West Coast.
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.200]   You go to New York and you see men wearing suits and ties.
[02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:15.120]   You don't see that here, perhaps in LA,
[02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:17.920]   not in the Bay Area, ever.
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:19.440]   - Yeah, one thing that you pointed out
[02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:22.600]   is that at any wedding in Argentina,
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:26.200]   men keep their jackets and ties on the whole night.
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:28.400]   I've always kept my jacket and tie on the entire night.
[02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:30.960]   In the United States, it's almost like moments
[02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:33.160]   after people arrive at any party in a suit,
[02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:34.280]   they start undressing.
[02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:35.120]   - Yeah, right.
[02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:36.680]   Why did they dress up then?
[02:59:36.680 --> 02:59:38.040]   Okay, so that's my view.
[02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:40.720]   So I am not necessarily someone that advocates
[02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:43.080]   wearing a tie when I go to work and so on,
[02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:45.320]   but I really believe that there are codes of conduct
[02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:47.200]   that sort of reflect many things.
[02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:51.000]   And you're also, you're projecting a message, right?
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.240]   I mean, the idea of a hoodie, at one point or the other,
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:54.640]   first of all, was hurting behavior.
[02:59:54.640 --> 02:59:56.800]   Everybody had to wear one because, you know,
[02:59:56.800 --> 02:59:58.560]   then you're cool or, you know, whatever.
[02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:01.320]   Okay, in adolescence, I understand it.
[03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:02.960]   I mean, that's what you do as an adolescent.
[03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:04.520]   You do what others do.
[03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:07.240]   But as you grow up, you can also signal whom you are
[03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:10.120]   by the way you dress and you, you know, you behave.
[03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:11.960]   - Well, what do you think about the discourse
[03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:15.760]   on platforms like X, where you can see a mix,
[03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:18.720]   including a lot of academics and high-level thinkers,
[03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:20.800]   acting kind of like teenagers?
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:23.040]   - Well, okay, that's, they want to be popular.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:24.880]   That's all, they want to draw attention.
[03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:26.040]   - Yeah, this is kind of a new thing.
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:28.800]   I mean, I mean, they're, I mean, I won't name names,
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.080]   but, you know, some people who are considered
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:33.960]   some of the smartest people in the world,
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:38.000]   like what they, their discourse on social media is like,
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:41.120]   I mean, they wouldn't last two seconds on the schoolyard,
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:42.200]   they'd get hit in the face.
[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:43.280]   You know, it's like weird,
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:46.440]   like grown men acting kind of like teenagers.
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:48.080]   - Okay, well, that's, they have a problem
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:50.400]   because they want to be thought of as young.
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:51.880]   That's a whole different story, okay?
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:52.960]   That's a different story.
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:54.560]   Now, having said what I said,
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:56.920]   I respect that some people eventually reflect
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:58.440]   on whether or not the rules,
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:00.560]   the rules that, you know, that rule, you know,
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:02.360]   the rules that say how you should dress
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:03.920]   to do one thing or the other are not,
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:06.000]   do not, you know, operate for you,
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.200]   and then you decide to be very different.
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:09.880]   You know, there are many people who are like that
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:11.960]   and like to be iconoclastic.
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:13.160]   I heard many stories about,
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:14.720]   we were talking about Richard Feynman,
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:16.240]   who actually made a case,
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:18.480]   I mean, Mary Gell-Mann used to say that about him,
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:20.640]   to be so different that people will talk about it
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:22.160]   because he was very interested in people
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:23.000]   telling stories about it.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.160]   - Yeah, bongo drumming naked on the roof,
[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:26.320]   not rushing his teeth.
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:27.440]   - Exactly, all that, okay.
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:30.360]   So that, but he was very good at drawing attention.
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:31.320]   Okay, that's fine.
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:34.280]   You can also draw attention by dressing very nicely.
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:36.400]   You know, it's all a matter of,
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.080]   I mean, I was reflecting, you know,
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:41.600]   we go to the symphony in San Francisco regularly,
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:43.280]   and we are donors and so on.
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:44.520]   Sometimes you go to a concert,
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:45.960]   it's an amazing thing what you see there.
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:47.600]   Some people nicely dressed,
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:50.280]   some people dressed as if they just woke up,
[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:51.400]   they didn't have time to get dressed,
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.120]   and, you know, got there, you know,
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:53.960]   and they're whatever.
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:55.160]   - But do you think that,
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.240]   going back to the initial, you know,
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:01:58.080]   ping of the question,
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:01.840]   do you think that we have societally gone,
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:03.480]   that we're sort of drifting towards,
[03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:06.400]   like, for lack of a better word, chaos?
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:09.120]   So our social interaction chaos.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:11.800]   - Well, you know, I think the pendulum will swing again.
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:13.200]   The other day I was talking to someone,
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:14.200]   reading actually,
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:16.640]   that suddenly, not only in New York,
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:17.480]   but in the Midwest,
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:20.360]   men are starting to wear jacket and ties,
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:22.040]   not just for work, okay?
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:23.400]   They go on dates like that.
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:24.560]   So, you know, it's a pendulum.
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:26.840]   It goes back and forth, back and forth.
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:28.560]   I don't think we're gonna end up in a time when,
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:29.800]   you know, you have to wear tails
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:31.920]   to have a breakfast or something.
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:34.160]   I think only the aristocrats used to do that.
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:35.480]   But I think that, you know,
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:37.160]   it's an issue of how,
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:39.480]   also, how we perceive the world
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:42.280]   through the eyes of television and movies, okay?
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:44.520]   If movies start showing that everybody's dressed whatever,
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:46.320]   you know, people are gonna do the same thing.
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:47.600]   If movies start showing, you know,
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:49.000]   the trends that we see in movies
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.080]   are the trends that essentially society follows, okay?
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:52.920]   - Definitely.
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:54.880]   - So, I think that we,
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:56.040]   I don't think we're going to chaos.
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:57.000]   It's gonna revert.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:00.000]   California is a particular place
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.600]   because it has always been a place
[03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:02.920]   where people, in order to feel free,
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:04.360]   they had to dress differently
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:06.400]   and who cares and all that stuff.
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:08.360]   But it's not everywhere.
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:09.560]   - Yeah, it's kind of interesting
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:12.400]   that now counterculture is conservatism.
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:13.480]   - Right, right.
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:15.040]   - We're back to that.
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:16.920]   The anti-war group is the more conservative.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:17.760]   Anyway, it's--
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:19.160]   - I mean, also, people like,
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:20.600]   you know, it's interesting how Americans
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:24.440]   are fascinated with English aristocracy and traditions.
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:25.880]   I've been to high table dinner
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:27.840]   at King's College in Cambridge twice.
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:31.120]   You know, everybody dresses properly.
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:33.320]   They wear gowns and the fellows are sitting
[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:35.040]   at a top table and everybody else,
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:36.360]   and people love it.
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:37.960]   And we like to see that in the movies.
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:39.160]   - Well, it's theater.
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:40.000]   - Yeah, right.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:40.840]   - I mean, it's academic theater,
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:42.360]   a little bit of pomp and circumstance,
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:43.200]   but it's theater.
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:44.040]   - And it's nice.
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:46.680]   Everything on commencement, you know, traditions and so on.
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:48.920]   - Yeah, no parent wants to go to a graduation
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:50.560]   that's, you know, kind of a free-for-all.
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:51.800]   They want to see some order.
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:53.160]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:55.040]   And I think that, you know, there is a place for that.
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.680]   And some people will, I mean,
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:03:59.000]   there are designers and sort of clothing and so on
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:02.160]   that exploit this nostalgia for that kind of elegant world.
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:04.720]   You know, Ralph Lauren and so it's always,
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:07.720]   you know, 1960s, fancy, you know,
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:09.880]   club type clothing and so on.
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:14.560]   So do you plan to ever retire?
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:17.360]   - I don't know what it means.
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:19.000]   I mean, if retire, no, no,
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:22.400]   because I'm not a postal worker.
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:25.360]   I'm not a cook at a restaurant that eventually says,
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:27.040]   okay, I cooked it long enough
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:29.600]   that I collect my retirement and go home.
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:31.520]   I have a mind that it works
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:34.920]   and I need an environment where that mind can thrive.
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:37.240]   And I need an environment where, you know,
[03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:39.520]   for one year, when I left Hewlett-Packard,
[03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.120]   I was basically, I took a course in general activity
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:44.680]   and so on, but I was really a bit idle.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:46.560]   So suddenly, I mean, in a context
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:48.080]   where people have problems and so on
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:49.680]   that I really like to listen to,
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:52.200]   there's a social component to work, as you know.
[03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:56.840]   So retirement means what, you know,
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:59.400]   you're a postal worker and one day you stop delivering mail
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:01.960]   and you stay home watching the paint dry,
[03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:04.040]   and that's not me, okay?
[03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:06.160]   So to me, I'm working and I enjoy it.
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.640]   And, you know, the day that will come
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:10.640]   that I cannot enjoy it, I'll stop.
[03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:13.080]   And I think that, again, goes with this issue
[03:05:13.080 --> 03:05:16.240]   of getting bored with things that you don't like to do,
[03:05:16.240 --> 03:05:19.240]   you know, because you've done it for a long time.
[03:05:19.240 --> 03:05:22.700]   No, I enjoy my life, but I don't think in terms of,
[03:05:22.700 --> 03:05:26.920]   I'll say something, the CEO of my company,
[03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:28.960]   he's a great guy, Phil McKinney, said,
[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:30.480]   "Bernardo, I don't work for the money here."
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:31.640]   I said, "I don't either.
[03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:34.240]   "I mean, I like to get paid, but if I don't like it,
[03:05:34.240 --> 03:05:36.500]   "I'll walk," and I can do that.
[03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:38.640]   So it's not that I'm doing this for the income.
[03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:39.680]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:42.320]   - Seems like you've never pursued money for its own sake.
[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:43.600]   - No, but-- - Nor did you ever
[03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:45.320]   encourage me to pursue money for its own sake.
[03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:47.640]   - But as my cousin, the physicist, used to say,
[03:05:47.640 --> 03:05:49.360]   "Money doesn't bring happiness,
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:51.200]   "but it points in the right direction."
[03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:52.900]   - I would say money doesn't bring happiness,
[03:05:52.900 --> 03:05:54.400]   but it can buffer stress.
[03:05:54.400 --> 03:05:56.160]   - Right, and it allows you to have the things
[03:05:56.160 --> 03:05:58.160]   you want to have and you don't have to, no.
[03:05:58.160 --> 03:06:00.380]   Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.
[03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:02.880]   I think money's an important aspect of our lives,
[03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:04.360]   you know, having it and so on.
[03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:07.000]   I lived for many years as a graduate student with no money,
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.540]   and it was very painful, I'll tell you.
[03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:10.680]   Sometimes I didn't eat dinner
[03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:12.320]   because I didn't have any money.
[03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:16.200]   So I like having money to do the things that I like,
[03:06:16.200 --> 03:06:17.600]   but I don't work for money.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:20.040]   Many people say, "Well, you know,
[03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:21.140]   "I invented so many things.
[03:06:21.140 --> 03:06:23.140]   "I could have started in some companies
[03:06:23.140 --> 03:06:25.400]   "and make a lot of money."
[03:06:25.400 --> 03:06:28.360]   I don't really, I don't regret that at all.
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:30.080]   - The ultra-rich people that I know
[03:06:30.080 --> 03:06:33.120]   who are happy are still working every day.
[03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:35.400]   - Right, because beyond a certain amount of money,
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:38.120]   you still have to brush your teeth like everybody else.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:41.660]   Okay, you can dream of having 150 toothbrushes, but so what?
[03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:43.920]   - Right, and you can only eat so many steaks.
[03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:44.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:44.760 --> 03:06:46.840]   I mean, that we all cover.
[03:06:46.840 --> 03:06:48.280]   The question is, what do you do with your life?
[03:06:48.280 --> 03:06:49.640]   Now, you want to travel?
[03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:50.480]   Well, you can travel.
[03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:52.040]   It's nice if you can travel, you know,
[03:06:52.040 --> 03:06:54.720]   in better ways than being, you know,
[03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:56.400]   an undergrad with the backpack,
[03:06:56.400 --> 03:06:57.240]   although it can be adventurous.
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:06:58.360]   - I had fun backpacking.
[03:06:58.360 --> 03:06:59.200]   - Yeah, okay, yeah.
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:00.680]   - In a limited budget where, you know,
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:02.800]   part of the joy of traveling that way
[03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:06.960]   is you're thrown into kind of street-level interactions.
[03:07:06.960 --> 03:07:08.360]   - I took-- - Youth hostels
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:09.200]   and things like that. - Yeah, I went
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:10.020]   through Europe like this.
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:11.040]   - I mean, I wouldn't change that for anything.
[03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:12.680]   - No, I went through Europe as a graduate student.
[03:07:12.680 --> 03:07:13.500]   I quit everything.
[03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:14.960]   I went to Europe in winter,
[03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:16.320]   and it was quite an adventure.
[03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:17.160]   - In the winter?
[03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:18.400]   - In the winter, it was horrendous.
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:19.800]   I had very little money.
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:22.040]   I stayed in places where, in Paris,
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:24.760]   where the lady in the little hotel
[03:07:24.760 --> 03:07:26.160]   would turn off the light if I turned it on
[03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:27.120]   in the middle of the night.
[03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:28.600]   It was awful, and yet--
[03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:29.640]   - To save energy.
[03:07:29.640 --> 03:07:32.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it was very funny,
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.920]   but I met people that were interesting,
[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:35.840]   and I engaged, you know, it was,
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:38.400]   I still, every once in a while,
[03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:41.680]   I hear from one or two of those people I met years ago
[03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:42.520]   in trains.
[03:07:42.520 --> 03:07:44.160]   I went by train everywhere.
[03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:46.760]   I ended up in Denmark in the middle of winter, you know.
[03:07:46.760 --> 03:07:48.920]   - Everything seems to lead back to Denmark.
[03:07:48.920 --> 03:07:49.760]   - Yeah, it's a nice country.
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:51.200]   - Well, now you have a Danish wife,
[03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:52.760]   so, and have for a long time.
[03:07:52.760 --> 03:07:54.900]   And have for a long time. - Yeah, many times, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:58.020]   No, I, yeah, I like, it's a very different contrast
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:08:00.860]   to Europe, the Central Europe, and so on, you know.
[03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:03.940]   Denmark, Northern Europe, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
[03:08:03.940 --> 03:08:06.820]   is a very special kind of, you know, country and people.
[03:08:06.820 --> 03:08:08.140]   Yeah, I like them a lot.
[03:08:08.140 --> 03:08:09.340]   Life is very easy there.
[03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:11.420]   - I like Scandinavia.
[03:08:11.420 --> 03:08:13.220]   - Yeah, yeah, it's very nice, yes.
[03:08:13.220 --> 03:08:15.140]   - Good, good, good-natured people.
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:15.980]   - Yes.
[03:08:15.980 --> 03:08:16.860]   - Good saunas.
[03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:18.420]   - Yeah, everything, yes.
[03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:20.060]   - And sunshine, at least in the summer.
[03:08:20.060 --> 03:08:21.420]   - In the summer only, yeah.
[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:25.180]   - Any plans for the next couple of years?
[03:08:25.180 --> 03:08:27.820]   Anything that we should put on the calendar,
[03:08:27.820 --> 03:08:29.580]   make sure that we get in?
[03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:32.220]   - No, because I cannot plan that well.
[03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:33.220]   I don't plan.
[03:08:33.220 --> 03:08:34.220]   - I just-- - Me either.
[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:35.220]   Maybe I inherited it from you.
[03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:36.500]   - Well, I just move.
[03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:38.180]   I just move and intuitive.
[03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:40.380]   I'm very intuitive about these things.
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:42.580]   I suddenly see something, you know, this quantum stuff.
[03:08:42.580 --> 03:08:44.780]   I don't know, I started hearing about it.
[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.760]   I talked to a brilliant guy who was in my lab.
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:48.700]   I said, "Hey, Gene, what do you think about this?"
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:50.660]   He said, "Oh, sounds interesting, let's do it."
[03:08:50.660 --> 03:08:52.260]   And we're doing it.
[03:08:52.260 --> 03:08:54.340]   I am lucky that I get paid to do that.
[03:08:54.340 --> 03:08:57.020]   But no, I don't have plans like that.
[03:08:57.020 --> 03:09:01.620]   I would like to, we would like, I mean,
[03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:03.100]   we would like to organize our life
[03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:04.860]   a little bit differently now that, you know,
[03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:07.420]   that we have a summer house in Denmark and so on.
[03:09:07.420 --> 03:09:08.860]   I still plan to travel there.
[03:09:08.860 --> 03:09:11.980]   I like Europe a lot, but I don't know if I can live there.
[03:09:11.980 --> 03:09:13.980]   I like Switzerland a lot.
[03:09:13.980 --> 03:09:15.660]   I wanna go to Argentina every year
[03:09:15.660 --> 03:09:17.860]   and I feel very close to my family.
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:19.740]   That's very important.
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:21.220]   We are all going for an event there.
[03:09:21.220 --> 03:09:24.020]   I hope that you can join us if you can.
[03:09:24.020 --> 03:09:25.680]   So those things are very important to me.
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:28.820]   But I, no, I don't have plans for anything.
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:32.360]   I don't know, I like to be surprised.
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:38.600]   - Well, dad, I wanna extend a real sense of gratitude
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:46.460]   from me, from everyone listening and watching.
[03:09:46.460 --> 03:09:50.540]   Although you may argue that they're not gonna be interested.
[03:09:50.540 --> 03:09:52.740]   This has been our back and forth over the last months
[03:09:52.740 --> 03:09:56.100]   as I've tried to convince you to do this podcast.
[03:09:56.100 --> 03:10:00.260]   I can assure you that they were, they are very interested.
[03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:01.780]   Your story is a really unique one.
[03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:04.100]   And I can say that both as your son,
[03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:07.620]   but also as somebody who's sat across from scientists
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:10.620]   from all different domains and backgrounds,
[03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:12.060]   not just neuroscientists.
[03:10:12.060 --> 03:10:16.140]   I also really appreciate your ability
[03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:19.480]   to explain complicated things in ways that at least,
[03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:21.860]   you know, we can start to get an understanding
[03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:25.140]   'cause these are hard concepts.
[03:10:25.140 --> 03:10:29.060]   And, you know, I think what comes through so clearly
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:32.140]   is that somehow you've been able to grab
[03:10:32.140 --> 03:10:35.260]   these high level, really abstract concepts
[03:10:35.260 --> 03:10:37.020]   and work with them and try and understand them.
[03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:39.060]   But you've also been able to lead a life
[03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.780]   where you're really grounded in the day-to-day
[03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:42.100]   and in reality.
[03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:44.620]   And I have to say your wish for me and for Laura,
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:46.820]   and I assume for everyone else to be joyful,
[03:10:46.820 --> 03:10:50.060]   I'll work on that.
[03:10:50.060 --> 03:10:55.060]   And also I must say, it just hit me like square in the face
[03:10:55.060 --> 03:10:59.780]   during this discussion that I get such peace
[03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:01.500]   and I can really focus on being joyful,
[03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:03.140]   knowing that you're joyful.
[03:11:03.140 --> 03:11:05.860]   Like it's so clear, like you have a joyful life
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:07.860]   at so many levels and that you've pursued
[03:11:07.860 --> 03:11:10.340]   what you wanted to do over and over.
[03:11:10.340 --> 03:11:14.420]   And, you know, some people may have tuned into this podcast
[03:11:14.420 --> 03:11:16.380]   thinking that we were gonna get into our issues
[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:17.220]   and things like that.
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:18.940]   I'll just briefly say that, yeah, we've had our ups,
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:22.780]   we've had our downs and we've certainly landed up
[03:11:22.780 --> 03:11:25.340]   and much, much higher than we ever would
[03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.080]   had we not had all of that.
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:33.140]   And as I told you last year around this time on your birthday
[03:11:33.140 --> 03:11:35.180]   when we all got together to celebrate,
[03:11:35.180 --> 03:11:38.300]   like we're not just good, we're beyond good.
[03:11:38.300 --> 03:11:40.780]   So anything that comes up around that,
[03:11:40.780 --> 03:11:43.660]   I wanna just go on record saying that like,
[03:11:43.660 --> 03:11:45.340]   that's water under the bridge
[03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:46.920]   and I don't ever think about it.
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:48.880]   All I think about are the incredible gifts
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:52.020]   that you've given me about curiosity
[03:11:52.020 --> 03:11:55.900]   and pursuing my curiosity about putting new footprints
[03:11:55.900 --> 03:11:59.260]   on untread beaches, the early discussions
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:01.740]   around the excitement that science can bring.
[03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:03.260]   I mean, I remember all of it.
[03:12:03.260 --> 03:12:06.500]   I really remember all of it and in immense detail.
[03:12:06.500 --> 03:12:08.620]   And I love your stories about scientists,
[03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:11.660]   both how they soar and also how human they are
[03:12:11.660 --> 03:12:13.820]   and how they're fallible like the rest of us.
[03:12:13.820 --> 03:12:17.660]   So, you know, there's not a day that goes by
[03:12:17.660 --> 03:12:21.460]   where I don't thank God, because I do believe in God,
[03:12:21.460 --> 03:12:25.700]   that you're my father, that you and mom created me and Laura
[03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:27.800]   and that I've had the life that I have
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:29.700]   and that I continue to have the life that I have.
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:32.380]   So I just wanna thank you for the example
[03:12:32.380 --> 03:12:34.480]   and the nurturing and for coming here.
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:36.420]   There aren't words.
[03:12:36.420 --> 03:12:37.260]   - Well, thank you.
[03:12:37.260 --> 03:12:39.220]   You know how much I love you.
[03:12:39.220 --> 03:12:44.160]   I think that these words are the biggest gift that I get.
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:46.760]   And I think any father listening to that,
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:48.760]   to his son or daughter saying that
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:51.400]   would also feel the same way or a mother for that matter.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:53.640]   It is a very fulfilling feeling, you know,
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.520]   to have that notion that you feel that you owe so much
[03:12:57.520 --> 03:12:59.280]   to what you got.
[03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:01.840]   And also the fact that you've done incredibly well
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:03.920]   and the kind of person you are, yeah.
[03:13:03.920 --> 03:13:08.200]   So I wish you all the wisdom that you need
[03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:10.960]   in order to just go through life the way you're going.
[03:13:10.960 --> 03:13:14.360]   But I think that it's nice to also that we are
[03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:16.920]   sort of on the same wavelength and many things.
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:18.880]   In you, I see more of a reflection
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:21.560]   of what I always wanted to be as well.
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:23.320]   So that's easier in a way.
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:26.400]   Perhaps it's because fathers and sons have that.
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:27.600]   - We certainly relate.
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:29.000]   - Yes.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:29.840]   - Well, thank you.
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:30.660]   - Thank you.
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:31.500]   - I love you.
[03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:32.320]   - I love you too.
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:33.160]   You know that.
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:34.720]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:09.040]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:10.840]   I do read all the comments.
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:11.980]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:14:11.980 --> 03:14:13.200]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:14.800]   It's my very first book.
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:16.200]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:18.360]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:19.520]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:20.680]   for more than five years,
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:23.000]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:24.560]   of research and experience.
[03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:27.620]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:30.120]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:32.560]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:35.920]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:38.000]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.900]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:14:41.900 --> 03:14:44.280]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:46.040]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:14:46.040 --> 03:14:47.800]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:50.540]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:14:50.540 --> 03:14:52.520]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:55.440]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:58.400]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:00.200]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:01.360]   And on all those platforms,
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:03.480]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:05.000]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:06.400]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:08.500]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:09.800]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:13.460]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:15:13.460 --> 03:15:14.640]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:16.200]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:15:16.200 --> 03:15:17.720]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:19.680]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:21.080]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:23.280]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:25.280]   one to three page PDFs.
[03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:27.560]   Those one to three page PDFs cover things like
[03:15:27.560 --> 03:15:29.800]   deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:31.840]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[03:15:31.840 --> 03:15:34.200]   We also have protocols for optimizing your sleep,
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:35.500]   dopamine, and much more.
[03:15:35.500 --> 03:15:37.880]   Again, all available, completely zero costs.
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:40.960]   Simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab,
[03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:43.320]   scroll down to newsletter and provide your email.
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:45.720]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:48.580]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:15:48.580 --> 03:15:50.400]   with Dr. Bernardo Huberman.
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:52.620]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:15:52.620 --> 03:15:54.660]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:57.240]   [upbeat music]
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:15:59.820]   (upbeat music)
