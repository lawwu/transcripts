[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We really all have a sort of dopamine set point.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.660]   or even different behaviors that increase our dopamine
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.260]   in these big peaks over and over and over again,
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.820]   we won't experience the same level of joy
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.600]   from those behaviors or from anything at all.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.840]   Now that has a name, it's called addiction,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   but even for people who aren't addicted,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.220]   even for people who don't have an attachment
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.620]   to any specific substance or behavior,
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.420]   this drop in below baseline after any peak in dopamine
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.500]   is substantial and it governs whether or not
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.580]   we are going to feel motivated
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.220]   to continue to pursue other things.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.140]   Fortunately, there's a way to work with this
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.380]   such that we can constantly stay motivated,
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.700]   but also keep that baseline of dopamine
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.640]   at an appropriate healthy level.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.960]   A previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.140]   was Dr. Anna Lembke.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.900]   She's head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.320]   at Stanford, has this amazing book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.280]   "Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence."
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.300]   If you haven't read the book,
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.260]   I highly encourage you to check it out, it's fantastic.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.220]   The other terrific book about dopamine
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.260]   is "The Molecule of More," which is similar in some regard,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.700]   but isn't so much about addiction,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.080]   it's more about other types of behaviors.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.780]   Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420]   and the relationship between these peaks
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.800]   and baselines of dopamine.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.740]   In Dr. Lembke's book,
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.580]   and when she was on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.420]   another podcast,
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.300]   she's talked about this pleasure-pain balance,
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.040]   that when we seek something that we really like
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.420]   or we indulge in it, like eating a little piece of chocolate,
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.780]   if we really like chocolate, there's some pleasure,
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.340]   but then there's a little bit of pain
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.500]   that exceeds the amount of pleasure, and it's subtle,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.940]   and we experience it as wanting more of that thing.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.020]   Okay, so there's a pleasure-pain balance,
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.900]   and I'm telling you that the pleasure and the pain
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.920]   are governed by dopamine to some extent.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.360]   Well, how could that be, right?
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.140]   I've said before, when you engage in an activity
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.860]   or when you ingest something that increases dopamine,
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580]   the dopamine levels go up to substantial degree
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.500]   with all the things I listed off.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.340]   Where's the pain coming from?
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340]   Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.820]   that follows, and you now know
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.220]   what that lack of dopamine reflects.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.340]   How do you know?
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.920]   Well, earlier we were talking about
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.300]   how dopamine is released between neurons,
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.340]   and I mentioned two ways.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.700]   One is into the synapse,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.980]   where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.020]   and the other was what I called volumetric release,
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.260]   where it is distributed more broadly.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.900]   It's released out over a bunch of neurons.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.220]   In both cases, it's released from these things
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.060]   we call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles,
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.020]   tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.820]   They get vomited out into the area or into the synapse.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.920]   Well, those vesicles get depleted.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.680]   For the synaptic physiologists out there,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.160]   we call this the readily releasable pool of dopamine.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.360]   We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.700]   that's packaged in those little vesicles and ready to go.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.480]   It's like when you order a product
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.800]   and they say out of stock until two months from now,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.560]   well, it's not ready to be released.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.480]   Same thing with dopamine.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.680]   There's a pool of dopamine that's synthesized,
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.260]   and you can only release the dopamine
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.960]   that's been synthesized, it's the readily releasable pool.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.260]   The pleasure-pain balance doesn't only hinge
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.660]   on the readily releasable pool of dopamine,
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.380]   but a big part of the pleasure-pain balance
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.860]   hinges on how much dopamine is there
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.940]   and how much is ready and capable
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.420]   of being released into the system.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.220]   So now we've given some meat to this thing
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.480]   that we call the pleasure-pain balance.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   And now it should make perfect sense
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.880]   why if you take something or do something
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.020]   that leads to huge increases in dopamine,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.480]   afterward, your baseline should drop
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.220]   because there isn't a lot of dopamine around
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.200]   to keep your baseline going.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.760]   What about the more typical scenario?
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.200]   What about the scenario of somebody
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.640]   who is really good at working during the week,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.220]   they exercise during the week, they drink on the weekends?
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.760]   Well, that person is only consuming alcohol
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.540]   maybe one or two nights a week.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.040]   But oftentimes that same person will be spiking
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   their dopamine with food during the middle of the week.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.040]   Now we all have to eat,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.840]   and it's nice to eat foods that we enjoy.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.000]   I certainly do that.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   I love food, in fact.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.860]   But let's say they're eating foods
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.720]   that really evoke a lot of dopamine release
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.680]   in the middle of the week.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.320]   They're drinking one or two days on the weekend.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.120]   They are one of these work hard, play hard types.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.900]   So they're swimming a couple of miles in the ocean
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.700]   in the middle of the week as well.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.460]   They're going out dancing once on the weekend.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.900]   Sounds like a pretty balanced life as I describe it.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.740]   Well, here's the problem.
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.860]   The problem is that dopamine is not just evoked
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.080]   by one of these activities.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.860]   Dopamine is evoked by all of these activities.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.460]   And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.780]   and desire and pleasure.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.040]   There's only one currency.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.300]   So even though if you look at the activities,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.040]   you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.880]   or this thing is only a couple of times a week.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   If you looked at dopamine simply as a function,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.500]   as a chemical function of peaks and baseline,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.040]   it might make sense why this person,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.000]   after several years of work hard, play hard,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   would say, yeah, you know, I'm feeling kind of burnt out.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.400]   I'm just not feeling like I have the same energy
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.920]   that I did a few years ago.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.840]   And of course there are age-related reasons
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.980]   why people can experience drops in energy.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.780]   But oftentimes what's happening
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.660]   is not some sort of depletion in cellular metabolism
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.640]   that's related to aging.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.980]   What's happening is they're spiking their dopamine
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.320]   through so many different activities throughout the week
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.820]   that their baseline is progressively dropping.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.100]   And in this case, it can be very subtle.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.440]   It can be very, very subtle.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   And that's actually a very sinister function of dopamine,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.420]   we could say, which is that it can often drop
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.300]   in imperceptible ways,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.900]   but then once it reaches a threshold of low dopamine,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.020]   we just feel like, hmm,
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.140]   we can't really get pleasure from anything anymore.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.000]   What used to work doesn't work anymore.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.640]   So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.540]   or the more acute addictions
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.180]   to things like cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.940]   which lead to these big increases,
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.220]   these big spikes in dopamine,
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.940]   and then these very severe drops in the baseline.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.540]   Now, of course, we all should engage in activities
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.780]   that we enjoy.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.380]   I certainly do, everybody should.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.720]   A huge part of life is pursuing activities
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.240]   and things that we enjoy.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.780]   The key thing is to understand this relationship
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.180]   between the peaks and the baseline
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.480]   and to understand how they influence one another.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.860]   Because once you do that,
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.880]   you can start to make really good choices in the short run
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.300]   and in the long run to maintain your level
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.420]   of dopamine baseline,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.420]   maybe even raise that level of dopamine baseline
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.340]   and still get those peaks
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.020]   and still achieve those feelings of elevated motivation,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.560]   elevated desire and craving.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.380]   Because again, those peaks
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.820]   and having a sufficiently healthy high level
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.260]   of dopamine baseline
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.940]   are what drove the evolution of our species.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.300]   And they're really what drive the evolution
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.320]   of anyone's life progression too.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.160]   So they're a good thing.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.880]   Dopamine is a good thing.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.460]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.740]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.540]   (upbeat music)
