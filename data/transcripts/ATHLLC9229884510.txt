[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.420]   Hello and welcome to All The Hacks, which is normally a podcast about upgrading
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.140]   your life, money, and travel, where I chat with an incredible guest to
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.940]   learn as many hacks as I can.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.860]   However, today is an episode all about the podcast itself and a look at my
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.340]   plans for the show in the coming year and beyond, as well as a recap of some
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.940]   of what I took away from the survey that so many of you graciously filled out.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.020]   I actually thought about doing this episode as a short clip at the
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.740]   beginning of a regular episode, but I realized I had so many things to
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.140]   share that I wanted to put it out separately and be able to cover it all.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.540]   So let's get into it.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.860]   First of all, thank you so much to everyone who filled out the survey.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.140]   I can't explain how helpful it is for me to hear what you all are thinking,
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.060]   especially because it's so hard to learn anything on a one-way channel like a
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.440]   podcast. That said, I do read every email that comes to chris@allthehacks.com
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.060]   and I try to respond to all of them, so please keep those coming.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.380]   As for the winner of the free flight, I'm going to do a random drawing this
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.180]   Friday and we'll share who wins on next week's episode.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.380]   All right, so first of all, I want to share one of the most interesting
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.740]   things I learned from the survey.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.260]   I asked what everyone's favorite episode was, and I assumed people would all
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.140]   gravitate towards the same two to three episodes, and there'd be plenty that
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.380]   didn't make the list, but that wasn't the case at all.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.860]   In fact, there wasn't a single one of the 40 episodes I've done that wasn't at
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.940]   least one person's favorite, which was so cool to see.
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.300]   While the votes were distributed across the whole catalog, there were a few
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.860]   episodes that made it to the top.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.900]   So whether you're new here or just curious, the top five were number 32
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.980]   about health hacks and NFTs with Kevin Rose, number 27 about travel hacks with
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.100]   the points guy, Brian Kelly, number one also about travel hacks with Lee Rowan,
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.420]   number three about credit card points and miles with Alex Miller, and number
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420]   19 with Andy Ratcliffe about investing.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.940]   The listener Q&A episodes number 20 and 33 also ranked really high.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.740]   So I'll link to all of them in the show notes, or you can just go to
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.820]   allthehacks.com/theepisodenumber if you want to find them more quickly.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.660]   All right, so despite that some listeners seem to love every topic I've done on
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.060]   the show, there were two big topics that rose to the top, and I'm definitely
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.220]   going to try to have more regular episodes on.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.140]   Number one, travel, credit card points, miles, and number two, money,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.860]   personal finance, and investing.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.340]   That doesn't mean I'm going to stop talking to people about productivity
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.820]   hacks or health hacks or life hacks, but you should definitely see
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.540]   these two topics more regularly.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.620]   One thing I didn't get from the survey are the specific, let's call them
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.860]   subtopics you're interested in within travel, personal finance, investing,
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.300]   or credit card points and miles.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.180]   So if there's anything specific you want me to touch on or find a guest
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.980]   for, just shoot me a quick email.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.740]   Even if it's just a blank email with the topic in the
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.260]   subject, I would love to know.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.940]   And speaking of email, if you have any negative feedback on the show,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.820]   please go ahead and email me.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.540]   I'm saying this in response to a review on Apple Podcasts.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.340]   They had some feedback about how I've focused less recently on the original
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.980]   travel money aspect of the show.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.220]   And if they're listening, I really appreciate hearing your feedback.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.820]   And as I said, I'm already planning on making changes as a result of it.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.380]   However, a one-star rating and review definitely hurts the show in search
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.060]   rankings, with sponsors, and if we're up for any podcast awards.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.060]   So first off, if you have feedback, feel free to share it with me first.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.780]   And if you're still disappointed, by all means, leave your negative review.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.900]   But to the 221 of you who took the survey and said you haven't left a rating or
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.780]   review in the Apple Podcasts app or on Spotify, but that you would, right now
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.700]   would be an amazing time to do that.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.220]   And I would really appreciate it.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.580]   Okay.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.580]   So another survey question was about me doing some solo episodes.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.540]   Somehow in my mind, writing a 3000 word newsletter with everything I've learned
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.700]   and researched about a topic made so much sense, but on the podcast, I feel
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.500]   like I needed a guest for everything.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.900]   So I still want to focus the show on interviewing incredible people because
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.540]   after all, the reason I started all the hacks is that I wanted to go out there
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.900]   and learn from all these amazing people myself, however, there are some topics
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.540]   where I'm the expert, or maybe I've done enough research to at least feel like
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.220]   one, where I might just do a solo episode and put it in the feed and talk about
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.580]   something I think you all will find really interesting.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.100]   And speaking of the newsletter, it was eyeopening to realize that many of the
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.020]   podcast listeners don't subscribe to the newsletter and many of the newsletter
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.820]   readers don't listen to the podcast.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.620]   In many cases, they just didn't know it existed, but for a lot of people, it was
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.260]   just that they prefer one type of content over the other.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.420]   Well, I didn't realize that, and I've been writing some great newsletter
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.660]   content that's never made its way to the podcast and vice versa.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.820]   So the best way not to miss anything is to obviously just subscribe to both of
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.140]   them, but I'm also thinking about ways to make sure the best content from each
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.340]   platform finds its way to the other platform as well, so stay tuned.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820]   And if you're not subscribed to the newsletter yet, you can do that
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.260]   at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.980]   Okay.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.620]   A few other quick things.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.180]   First, I've been recording video of almost every single episode.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.500]   So for anyone who's interested in seeing what these interviews actually look like,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.300]   I'll be putting all of them on YouTube as soon as I can get them all edited.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.500]   Number two, I'm going to start experimenting with asking every guest for
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.460]   some of their best local recommendations and hacks from wherever they live now or
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.540]   have lived to add a bit more good travel content to each episode.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.740]   Three, thank you for all the great podcast and newsletter recommendations.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.500]   I have such a long list of things to check out.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.140]   Four, I'm going to set up an online community where you guys can join me.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.260]   And the feedback was split almost perfectly down the middle between doing
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.300]   it as a Facebook group or on discord.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.780]   So stay tuned on which one of those platforms I choose, or maybe I'll
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.220]   find one that's better than both.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.380]   Five, I was surprised and honestly a bit excited to see that so many people
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.260]   were interested in live events.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.420]   So I'm going to think about what that looks like, but fun fact, Amy and I are
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.420]   expecting our second child this June.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.820]   So live events might not happen until the end of the year or
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.460]   next year at the earliest.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.740]   Okay.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.060]   Finally, I want to talk about sponsors and subscriptions.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.420]   I really hope I didn't scare any of you off asking questions about
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.500]   charging a subscription to the podcast.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.300]   In fact, I only asked because I had a few conversations with people who told
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.980]   me they actually prefer to pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of the show
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.620]   than listen to a show with ads.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.300]   And I just wanted to see how large that group of people was within this audience.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.740]   Well, now I can tell you it is not very large.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.660]   In fact, I can tell you it is exactly 1.7% of you.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.620]   That said, many of you said you would love to support me in the show.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.540]   So for now, the best way to support me is to share the podcast or your favorite
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.940]   episode with someone you think might like it, or honestly, lots of people
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.620]   you think might like it, or leave a five-star rating and review in the Apple
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.660]   Podcast app, but I will let you know if anything changes here.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.540]   As for sponsors, my plan is to only have sponsors who have products
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.060]   and services I can get behind.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.140]   When I say I personally recommend something, I want that to mean something
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.900]   to all of you, and it should because I've either used the product or done a
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.260]   meaningful amount of research on it, or both.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.380]   And if you ever think that's not the case, please reach out to me
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.140]   directly and I'd love to hear more.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.500]   However, I actually hope that by doing this, you view the sponsors as an
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.020]   opportunity to learn about new products and services you didn't know about already.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.980]   In fact, you all sent me so many great ideas for sponsors that I haven't even
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.500]   gotten through reaching out to all of those companies to see if
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.540]   they would sponsor the show.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.100]   So, hopefully you guys are excited as I am for the future of All The Hacks.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.220]   I have some amazing plans for 2022 and beyond, and I appreciate you all so much
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.260]   for listening, for giving me feedback, and for everything else you've
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.460]   done to support the show.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.980]   Thank you so much.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.940]   And quick reminder to leave a rating and review for the show, or email
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.540]   me anytime with feedback, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.340]   All right, see you next time.
