[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.480]   Hello, and welcome to All The Hacks, which is normally a podcast about
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.520]   upgrading your life, money, and travel, where I chat with an incredible guest
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.400]   to learn as many hacks as I can.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.320]   However, today is an episode all about the podcast itself and a look at my
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.800]   plans for the show in the coming year and beyond, as well as a recap of some
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   of what I took away from the survey that so many of you graciously filled out.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   I actually thought about doing this episode as a short clip at the
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.720]   beginning of a regular episode, but I realized I had so many things to share
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.600]   that I wanted to put it out separately and be able to cover it all.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.040]   So let's get into it.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.320]   First of all, thank you so much to everyone who filled out the survey.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.600]   I can't explain how helpful it is for me to hear what you all are thinking,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   especially because it's so hard to learn anything on a one-way channel like a
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   podcast.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480]   That said, I do read every email that comes to chris@allthehacks.com and I try
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.800]   to respond to all of them.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480]   So please keep those coming.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.800]   As for the winner of the free flight, I'm going to do a random drawing this
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.600]   Friday and we'll share who wins on next week's episode.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.240]   All right.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.120]   So first of all, I want to share one of the most interesting things
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   I learned from the survey.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.680]   I asked what everyone's favorite episode was, and I assumed people would all
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.560]   gravitate towards the same two to three episodes, and there'd be plenty that
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   didn't make the list.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.800]   But that wasn't the case at all.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   In fact, there wasn't a single one of the 40 episodes I've done that wasn't at
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360]   least one person's favorite, which was so cool to see.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.720]   While the votes were distributed across the whole catalog, there were a few
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.280]   episodes that made it to the top.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   So whether you're new here or just curious, the top five were number 32
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.400]   about health hacks and NFTs with Kevin Rose, number 27 about travel hacks with
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.520]   the points guy, Brian Kelly, number one, also about travel hacks with Lee Rowan,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.840]   number three, about credit card points and miles with Alex Miller, and number
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   19 with Andy Ratcliffe about investing.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.360]   The listener Q&A episodes number 20 and 33 also ranked really high.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.600]   So I'll link to all of them in the show notes, or you can just go to allthehacks.com/the
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.240]   episode number if you want to find them more quickly.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.600]   All right.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.560]   So despite that some listeners seem to love every topic I've done on the show,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.920]   there were two big topics that rose to the top, and I'm definitely going to try
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.640]   to have more regular episodes on.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.560]   Number one, travel, credit card points, miles, and number two, money,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.280]   personal finance, and investing.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.760]   That doesn't mean I'm going to stop talking to people about productivity
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.240]   hacks or health hacks or life hacks, but you should definitely see
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.960]   these two topics more regularly.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.080]   One thing I didn't get from the survey are the specific, let's call them
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.280]   subtopics you're interested in within travel, personal finance, investing,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.720]   or credit card points and miles.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.640]   So if there's anything specific you want me to touch on or find a guest
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   for, just shoot me a quick email.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.720]   Even if it's just a blank email with the topic in the subject, I would love to know.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.360]   And speaking of email, if you have any negative feedback on the show,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.240]   please go ahead and email me.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.960]   I'm saying this in response to a review on Apple Podcasts.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.760]   They had some feedback about how I've focused less recently on the original
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   travel money aspect of the show.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.640]   And if they're listening, I really appreciate hearing your feedback.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.240]   And as I said, I'm already planning on making changes as a result of it.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.800]   However, a one-star rating and review definitely hurts the show in search
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.480]   rankings, with sponsors, and if we're up for any podcast awards.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   So first off, if you have feedback, feel free to share it with me first.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.200]   And if you're still disappointed, by all means, leave your negative review.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.280]   But to the 221 of you who took the survey and said, you haven't left a rating or
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.200]   review in the Apple Podcasts app or on Spotify, but that you would, right now
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   would be an amazing time to do that.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.640]   And I would really appreciate it.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.960]   Okay.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   So another survey question was about me doing some solo episodes.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.960]   Somehow in my mind, writing a 3000 word newsletter with everything I've learned
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.360]   and researched about a topic made so much sense, but on the podcast, I feel like I
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.920]   needed a guest for everything, so I still want to focus the show on interviewing
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.040]   incredible people because after all the reason I started all the hacks is that I
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.640]   wanted to go out there and learn from all these amazing people myself.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.520]   However, there are some topics where I'm the expert, or maybe I've done enough
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.000]   research to at least feel like one, where I might just do a solo episode and put it
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.960]   in the feed and talk about something I think you all will find really interesting.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.520]   And speaking of the newsletter, it was eyeopening to realize that many of the
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.440]   podcast listeners don't subscribe to the newsletter and many of the newsletter
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   readers don't listen to the podcast.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.040]   In many cases, they just didn't know it existed, but for a lot of people, it was
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.680]   just that they prefer one type of content over the other.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   Well, I didn't realize that, and I've been writing some great newsletter content
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.080]   that's never made its way to the podcast and vice versa.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.240]   So the best way not to miss anything is to obviously just subscribe to both of
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.600]   them, but I'm also thinking about ways to make sure the best content from each
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.800]   platform finds its way to the other platform as well.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.760]   So stay tuned.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.280]   And if you're not subscribed to the newsletter yet, you can do that
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.720]   at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.440]   Okay.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.080]   A few other quick things.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   First, I've been recording video of almost every single episode.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.960]   So for anyone who's interested in seeing what these interviews actually look like,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.720]   I'll be putting all of them on YouTube as soon as I can get them all edited.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.960]   Number two, I'm going to start experimenting with asking every guest for
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.920]   some of their best local recommendations and hacks from wherever they live now or
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.000]   have lived to add a bit more good travel content to each episode.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   Three, thank you for all the great podcast and newsletter recommendations.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.000]   I have such a long list of things to check out.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.600]   Four, I'm going to set up an online community where you guys can join me.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.720]   And the feedback was split almost perfectly down the middle between doing
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.800]   it as a Facebook group or on discord.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.280]   So stay tuned on which one of those platforms I choose, or maybe I'll
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.720]   find one that's better than both.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.880]   Five, I was surprised and honestly a bit excited to see that so many people
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.760]   were interested in live events.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   So I'm going to think about what that looks like.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.920]   But fun fact, Amy and I are expecting our second child this June.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   So live events might not happen until the end of the year or
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.960]   next year at the earliest.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   Okay.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.560]   Finally, I want to talk about sponsors and subscriptions.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.880]   I really hope I didn't scare any of you off asking questions about
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.960]   charging a subscription to the podcast.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.760]   In fact, I only asked because I had a few conversations with people who told
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.400]   me they actually prefer to pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of the show
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.040]   than listen to a show with ads.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.760]   And I just wanted to see how large that group of people was within this audience.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.160]   Well, now I can tell you it is not very large.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.080]   In fact, I can tell you it is exactly 1.7% of you.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.040]   That said, many of you said you would love to support me in the show.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.960]   So for now, the best way to support me is to share the podcast or your favorite
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.360]   episode with someone you think might like it, or honestly, lots of people
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.040]   you think might like it, or leave a five-star rating and review in the Apple
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.080]   Podcast app, but I will let you know if anything changes here.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.960]   As for sponsors, my plan is to only have sponsors who have products
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   and services I can get behind.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.160]   When I say I personally recommend something, I want that to mean
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.800]   something to all of you, and it should because I've either used the product
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.680]   or done a meaningful amount of research on it, or both.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.800]   And if you ever think that's not the case, please reach out to me
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.560]   directly and I'd love to hear more.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.880]   However, I actually hope that by doing this, you view the sponsors as an
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.440]   opportunity to learn about new products and services you didn't know about already.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   In fact, you all sent me so many great ideas for sponsors that I haven't even
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.920]   gotten through reaching out to all of those companies to see if
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.960]   they would sponsor the show.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.480]   So hopefully you guys are excited as I am for the future of All the Hacks.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.600]   I have some amazing plans for 2022 and beyond, and I appreciate you all so much
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.640]   for listening, for giving me feedback, and for everything else you've
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.840]   done to support the show.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.360]   Thank you so much.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.320]   And quick reminder to leave a rating and review for the show, or email
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   me anytime with feedback, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.760]   All right.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.720]   See you next time.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.400]   deep on all things money.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.360]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.320]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.800]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   make this show so entertaining.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.120]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.280]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.240]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.880]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.520]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.480]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.240]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.720]   your money and grow your wealth.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.880]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.760]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
