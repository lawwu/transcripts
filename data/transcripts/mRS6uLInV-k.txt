[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Amy writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, why should I even consider having kids of my own
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   when there are so many children in need of loving homes now?"
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Let me set up an understanding of Scripture that makes that question valid,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   even though Genesis 128 says, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth,"
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   because there's a structure of biblical thought that I have to put in place before I can try to answer this.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   A person might say, "Well, doesn't that just settle it? Be fruitful?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   That means have babies, multiply and fill the earth, so do it. Don't just adopt. Do that."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Well, it's not that simple.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   The way I get at it is by comparing the question with marriage,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   because Genesis 218 says, "It's not good for man to be alone. I'll make him a helper fit for him."
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So marriage is normative. You might even say commanded in the creation order.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And yet Paul, in 1 Corinthians 7, 7 and 8, says, "I wish that everybody was single like I am,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   but each has his own gift from God, one of one kind, one of another."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And so he explains that the reason he's commending singleness is because in this fallen world
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and in this urgent hour, there's greater difficulty in serving the Lord fully without any distraction
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   when you're married than when you're single.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He wants to see some people single so that they can be more fully devoted
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   without having to take thought for what a wife or a husband might need.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And yet he says, "You do not sin if you marry."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Now, I'm going to take that same principle and apply it to children.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   If you can say to God's good marriage ordinance,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   "The redemptive order after the fall may call for a relativizing of the created order before the fall."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Maybe, I think the answer is yes, the redemptive order of having children after the fall
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   may relativize the created order of be fruitful and multiply before the fall.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So I've counseled a lot of people who have asked me, "Should we even have children?"
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Sometimes they weren't putting this, usually they weren't putting this in the context of adoption
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   like this question does.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Can we choose not to have children?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I never say yes.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I say what I'm saying now.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Children are a blessing from the Lord.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That's plain in the Bible.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And the modern resistance to having children as though they get in the way and are a pain in the neck,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   that's a sign of cultural corruption and selfishness.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And so if that's your motive for not having kids, no, you're not obeying Jesus.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If you're viewing children as that kind of pain in the rear end
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and you want to go on and do your own thing without the encumbrance of having to care for kids,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   then you have an attitude that isn't biblical.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I would never commend childlessness the way the world commends childlessness.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But there may be kingdom reasons for not having children.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And I don't think those reasons can be elevated to normative or absolute.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So we shouldn't require that of anyone just the same way I don't elevate the creation order to absoluteness.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Like you have to have children.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So how does a couple decide, especially in view of the number of orphans in the world who need a home?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Beware of making artificial judgments here.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   The reason most people don't adopt is not that they want children of their own.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The vast majority of adoptive parents have children biologically,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   children that they've gotten through their own union.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   That's what I mean when I say children of their own.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   You have to be so careful because our adopted children are children of our own.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The question boils down to whether the natural good desire for joy of reproduction,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   having children from your own union, is permissible and good if it keeps you from adopting a child.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Practically, I would say first, it doesn't.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It doesn't.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I mean, I've never met anybody who hasn't adopted because they've had children of their own.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But the second thing I would say, it is permissible and good for us to eat food even though others need food more.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We wear clothes that others need more.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We pursue education when others have less.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We're housed in apartments or in houses when others have less.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, how is that right?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   How is it justifiable?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's a huge question.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But the answer seems to be that our having is usually not the reason others don't have.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's not a zero-sum game in this world of resources.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Therefore, love is usually not our going without, but rather our giving effort and time and money and things and ourselves
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   to help others have access to what we want for ourselves.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's what neighbor love means.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Doing others as you'd have them doing to you.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Love your neighbors yourself.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Work for their access to what you want access to.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   There's no doubt in my mind that this will simplify our lifestyles and make a wartime way of life for us.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But in and of itself, simplifying, going without, does not do anyone any good unless you have a strategy to help them get access to what you want to have for yourself.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So now when I come to apply that to children, it seems to me that the call on our lives is not mainly not to give birth,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   since the Bible portrays that as a great blessing and a legitimate joy.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   The call in our lives is to give ourselves in ways that we can to provide for orphans.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   That may be adoption.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I pray that it would be more and more.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And it may mean fewer biological children.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Not often, I would guess, but it might.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   But it will always mean praying and acting toward as many ways as we can of investing our lives in the cause of the orphan,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   along with all the other needs in the world.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Yes. Thank you, Pastor John.
