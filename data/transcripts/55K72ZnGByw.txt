[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   [music]
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.600]   Pastor John, speak to pastors and speak about pastoring in answering why you
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.340]   choose to tweet and blog in the midst of destructive natural disasters like
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.540]   tornadoes. What's the goal in doing this?
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:28.500]   Yeah. The goal, Tony, of pastoral ministry is faith in our people and glory for our
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.360]   God and all of that great faith, strong faith, indomitable faith, glorifying God,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.920]   all of that spilling over for the same in the world. We want more of that to
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.720]   happen in the world. We don't want our people to stumble into unbelief or into
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.280]   doubt when they are clobbered by some grief, loss, pain, suffering, and we don't
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.200]   want God to be dishonored. So two huge goals for pastoral ministry, and I think
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.760]   for all of life, is we want to help them be strong in faith and we want to help
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.640]   them give glory to God. And pain and suffering and calamities and cancer and
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.720]   the loss of loved ones are huge tests of faith. And pastors aim to help their
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.920]   people be strong in those seasons, and we do it before them and during them and
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.160]   after them. And I think it's crucial that we focus on all three of those.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.040]   Before the calamity comes, we're preparing them with true views of
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.840]   God and his sovereign goodness and his deep love for them and their confidence
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.800]   in him, and we do it during the events by being there. This is really crucial that
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   as pastors we be there for our people, perhaps even in silence like Job's
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.880]   friends in the first golden seven days of their ministry when they were not
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.800]   trying to persuade Job of bad theology, like God only blesses the good and he
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   punishes the bad. That's bad theology. So when they were quiet, they were more
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.440]   helpful than when they spoke. And I've sat for long stretches of time saying
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.760]   nothing with a 23-year-old man whose wife had just been killed after being
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.120]   married three months. I walked into that room, the body was in the next
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680]   room, he hadn't even seen her yet. And I sat down and I looked at this situation
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   I said, "This is not a time to say anything." We sat there for, I don't know,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.920]   half an hour maybe in total silence, and then I heard him begin to sing. He sang,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   he was singing a little song. And I started to cry and thought, "Okay, this man
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.760]   might be ready to hear me sing or say something." And on the other hand, Tony,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   I've walked into a room and the first thing a husband said to me with his wife
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   in emergency surgery after heart attack was, "John, tell us something important
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.840]   from the Word. Give us something from the Word, John." So I know that that during
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.080]   the moment, right in the moment of loss, there's time for silence, there's a time
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.800]   for speaking. And then afterwards, we should remember to help people
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:38.520]   afterwards. My mom died in 1974. I still get emails from people who remember
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.840]   December 16 for me. Isn't that amazing? They write to me and say, "Thinking about
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.440]   your mom and what she meant to me on that. That's 38 years ago." So it
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.240]   matters that we get our people ready before, during, and after. And I think,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.880]   Tony, most of our effort goes into helping them before, because that's where
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   we spend most of our time. We're not in calamity most of our life. We're
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.040]   preparing for it most of our life. And so I think we as pastors have to think
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.440]   through all of our options, and we have our pulpit, we have maybe a newsletter, we
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.920]   have maybe a blog or a Twitter account, we always have a bedside to go to. And I
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.160]   think a pastor has to always be thinking, "How is what I'm doing preparing my
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.000]   people?" So Tony, one of the things I think about whenever a calamity happens is, not
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.160]   just, "What should I or shouldn't I say in the midst of it for those there in the
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.960]   calamity?" but, "What should I say? How should I comport myself for the sake of
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.880]   my people, for the sake of my family, for those who are not in the calamity?" and/or
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.200]   watching what I say about a calamity when it comes. That's the way I'm
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.040]   thinking, partly when I think about my people as well as those who are in the
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.960]   calamity. Yes, and with the Internet we can all be transported into a calamity
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.680]   within moments, live, even if we're not personally touched by it. So it seems
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.920]   there's an opportunity to address the situation in the moment, and maybe those
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.400]   on the ground who are touched by the disaster will not even hear what's going
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.080]   on in Twitter. Right, and it's complicated because those on the ground may read it.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:37.320]   I mean, that's the new phenomenon that we have with blogs and with Twitter, is that
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.440]   anybody, anywhere, in any condition, can read anything we say addressing any
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.400]   situation, and we have to be ready for the fact that if we say something
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.960]   we think will be helpful to one group, another group might read it and not be
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   helped by it, and thus we're always making judgment calls about, "On balance
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   will this be helpful or not to the greatest number of people?" and we
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.720]   can miss that sometimes, and we have to be ready for people to say, "You didn't
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.040]   help me," and another set of people say, "Thank you very much," and we just hope
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.920]   and we pray that we're wise enough, we say things often enough, and in a
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.160]   diverse enough way so that lots of people are blessed by what we say. So one
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.500]   reason you want to address the natural disasters when they happen is so that
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.100]   those who are listening on Twitter will be thinking about God's sovereignty over
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.080]   life before they are themselves in the hospital facing cancer and facing
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.880]   calamity in their own life. Yes, I have in mind people who've been through the
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.600]   issue a year ago or ten years ago, people who are in the suffering right now, and
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.800]   people who will go through it in a year, because my goal is to spread a passion
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.680]   for the supremacy of God in all things, for the joy of all peoples. I want their
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.360]   faith to be preserved. I want every tweet I tweet, every blog I write, every sermon
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.440]   I preach to be a means for people's indomitable joy in the face of horrible
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.600]   loss, whether they've gone through it, are in it, or will go through it. Thank you,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.440]   Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast at DesiringGod.org.
