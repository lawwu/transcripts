[00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:20.460]   Like I said, I'm Justin, CEO and co-founder of Ionic, and at Ionic, we're on a mission
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960]   to help agents interact with the economy, starting with e-commerce.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   Why?
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680]   Well, when we started working with agents, we wanted them to be able to do things for
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   us on our behalf.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.360]   We wanted them to be able to order the Uber to the airport later today.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.980]   We wanted them to be able to find the perfect gift for Mom for Mother's Day, find the best
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.140]   hotel for that last-minute weekend trip.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.560]   And when we started working on those types of tasks and those types of problems, we quickly
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.540]   ran into a set of issues.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.560]   And what we learned is that for the last 30 years, we've built a world for ads and not
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560]   for actions.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.020]   Agents, we want them to do things on our behalf, and so we need to change that paradigm.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.360]   So let's give you an example of kind of what that looks like.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.040]   So, code here on the left is the data feed for a product.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.360]   It's an ad.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360]   That ad is static.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.960]   It's meant for a human to see it, a human to click on it, go somewhere else, maybe go somewhere
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.540]   else after that, learn some more, come back, and make a transaction happen.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.360]   I don't know about you, but I don't need my agent bouncing from site to site to do things.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360]   For me, I want it to all happen in one place.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   And so, what does that mean?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.040]   Well, it means in the future, I want my agent to know that I don't wear an extra large shirt.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.440]   I wear a shirt that's measured 21 inches from the top to the bottom, that I don't need a
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.720]   cotton blend.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   I need 7% modal.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.040]   I need a certain percentage of cotton, right?
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   And so, those are the types of things that we can have our agents do.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.720]   But where we're starting today, these ad feeds on the left, they don't even know if a product
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   is in stock.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   They're shipping.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   They're static.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   They're not dynamic.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.720]   So, what are we doing?
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.100]   We're building an ecosystem where we have partnerships with hundreds of merchants.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.800]   They give us access to that product feed that they have.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.700]   And then, we are using agentic workflow to enrich that data with the loop here on the bottom.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.840]   We're taking editorial, product reviews, anything else that we need or that your agent will find
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.520]   interesting and putting that all in one place.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.280]   Importantly, it's in the format that an agent wants to see, whether that's a relational
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.640]   database, a vector store, a graphical database.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.820]   We'll continue to grow and work with everyone here as we continue to progress on how that data
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.900]   should be accessed.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.960]   That's in all access via our API.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.500]   That API is live today and is usable by anyone in this room.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.260]   But, after we have the data in the right place to make a decision, we then, again, like I
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   said, we don't need to be bouncing around.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.740]   We want that transaction to happen, that action to happen right in the same layer.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.400]   And so, from here, you can see this example of me potentially finding headphones for my flight
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.260]   later today.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.260]   And once we've made that decision, my agent's worked with me on my behalf, we can just say,
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.020]   "Yeah, I want to check out."
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.020]   And the payment token can come through and we can complete the transaction immediately.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.020]   That's the way it should be.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.720]   Agents should be able to do all these things in one simple step.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   Okay.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.480]   So, we've talked about better decisions.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   We've talked about better actions.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   The last part, the secret.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   We'll talk about better monetization.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   Okay.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   So, consumer AI products.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.040]   I think I saw this tweet on the left the week I had signed up for my fourth pro subscription
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.540]   of the month.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.100]   And it just really resonated with me that we're not going to be able to charge consumers for
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.240]   our AI products a $20 a month subscription fee forever.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.960]   It'll work for the early adopters, but it's not mass market.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.780]   The secret is that merchants will pay everyone in this room to help them find the right consumer
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.840]   and match them to the best products.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   We're starting with e-commerce today.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.120]   Again, like I said, eventually that'll be hotel rooms, it'll be flights, it'll be everything.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240]   But, you know, I'll give you an example.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   We've seen some cool demos out there where people are sending agents out.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   They go and they buy something on Amazon and we all like clap and we repost it on Twitter
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.380]   and like, yes, that is cool.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.280]   But for that merchant on the other side of the transaction, they're just paying Amazon.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.160]   Amazon is taking all the credit.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.600]   And so if we're going through the process of enriching a data feed and we're helping agents
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   understand what consumers want and we're making better decisions happen and transactions happen,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.320]   instead of a merchant getting a yes, you checked out from Amazon and that being at the end of
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.760]   the day, they know what data was going out into the world, what models saw it, how they used
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.160]   it, what the action flow was, the transaction took place.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.200]   And then they're able to understand from that customer the ongoing relationship and they're
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.480]   willing to pay for that and they'd rather pay you for that than Amazon.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.040]   Side note, Amazon will also pay you as well, just not as much.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   Okay.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   And so to get that started, we've created relationships with hundreds of merchants.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.320]   You can work with them immediately today.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   We've got a catalog that's already enabled with millions of SKUs.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.420]   He said it's AI native and it keeps growing.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.420]   We're hiring.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.920]   If you want to work with us, it's Justin or Owen at Ionic Commerce.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   If you want to get started, check out the docs.

[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   Thanks.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   Thanks.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   Thanks.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   Thanks.

[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Thanks.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.060]   We'll see you next time.
