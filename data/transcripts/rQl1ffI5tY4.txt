[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   In economics, we have something called tournament theory, and this says that it can be extremely
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.780]   socially valuable to go and have seemingly unreasonably large rewards for people that
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.720]   do something useful because it doesn't just incentivize the winner, it incentivizes all
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.200]   the potential winners. Billionaires are not just an inspiration to each other. It's not
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800]   just, "Oh, I can get to be a billionaire. I'll do this thing and make the money." It
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.500]   is something that actually, I think, fosters a whole culture of entrepreneurship.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.960]   We've been hanging out in Austin, all over there. There's a whole bunch of people who
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.320]   are never going to be billionaires, Dwarkesh. I've told people, like Dwarkesh, "Will Dwarkesh
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   ever be a billionaire? Probably not, but 2%. Dwarkesh is just a mover and a shaker."
