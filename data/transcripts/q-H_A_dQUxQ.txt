[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.340]   Today is episode three of the podcast,
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.960]   and it is office hours.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.160]   Office hours, as many of you know,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.960]   it's where students come to the office of the professor,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.920]   sit down and ask questions,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.200]   requesting clarification about things that were confusing,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   or to simply go down the route
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.120]   of exploring a topic with more depth and detail.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.080]   Somebody asked,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.040]   "What is the role of moonlight and fire?"
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.240]   or things of that sort.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.360]   "In setting circadian rhythms,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.160]   is it okay to view moonlight at night,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.560]   or will that wake me up?
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   Will a fire in my fireplace or using candlelight
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.720]   be too much light?"
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.880]   Great question.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.480]   Turns out that moonlight, candlelight,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.780]   and even a fireplace,
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.160]   if you have one of these roaring fires
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.880]   going in the fireplace,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.280]   do not reset your circadian clock at night
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240]   and trick your brain into thinking that it's morning.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   Even though, if you've ever sat close to a fireplace
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.240]   or even a candle, that light seems very bright.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.060]   And there are two reasons for that that are very important.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.480]   The first one is that these neurons in your eye
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.240]   that I discussed in the previous episode,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   these melanopsin ganglion cells,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.120]   also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.140]   those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.480]   And those cells respond best to the blue-yellow contrast
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.000]   present in the rising and setting sun,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.920]   so-called low solar angle sun,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.160]   also discussed in the previous episode.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.600]   But those cells adjust their sensitivity
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.680]   even a full moon, a really bright moon, or fire,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.120]   because we talked about just how crucial it is
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.160]   to avoid bright lights
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.120]   between the hours of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.760]   except when you need to view things for sake of safety
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.880]   or work and so forth.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.300]   I also received a lot of questions about red light.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.840]   In principle, red light will not stimulate the melanopsin
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.240]   retinal neurons that wake up the brain and circadian clock
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.040]   and signal daytime.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.520]   However, most of the red lights,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.680]   in particular the red lights that come on these sheets
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.400]   or these products that people are supposed to view
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   in order to access a number of health effects,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.040]   those are way too bright
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   and would definitely wake up your body and brain.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.520]   So if you're thinking about red light
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.360]   for sake of avoiding the negative effects of light
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.320]   later in the day and at night,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.720]   then you want that red light to be very, very dim,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   certainly much dimmer than is
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.160]   on most of those commercial products.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.680]   Now, do you need red lights?
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.640]   No, although red lights are rather convenient
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.880]   because you can see pretty well with them on,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.780]   but if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock,
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.360]   they won't have this dopamine disrupting thing
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.200]   that we talked about in the previous podcast.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.420]   Okay, a huge number of people asked me
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.920]   about light through windows.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.680]   Setting your circadian clock
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.420]   with sunlight coming through a window
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.600]   is going to take 50 to 100 times longer.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.160]   You can download the free app, Light Meter.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   You can have a bright day outside or some sunlight,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.400]   hold up that app, take a picture.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.780]   It'll tell you how many lux are in that environment.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.240]   Now close the window.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.280]   And if you want, close the screen or don't open the screen.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.360]   You can do all sorts of experiments.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.040]   You'll see that it will at least half the amount of lux.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.440]   And it doesn't scale linearly,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.000]   meaning let's say I get 10,000 lux outside,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.080]   5,000 looking out through an open window,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.920]   and then I close the window and it's 2,500 lux.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.520]   It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.160]   for twice as long if it's half as many lux, okay?
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.640]   It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.720]   for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means you look for five minutes.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.320]   It doesn't scale that way
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.660]   just because the biology doesn't work that way.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.120]   Best thing to do is to get outside if you can.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.620]   If you can't, next best thing to do
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.240]   is to keep that window open.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.800]   It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.240]   and contacts.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.680]   Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.480]   when those are glass also,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.520]   but looking through a window diminishes the effect?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.200]   Well, we should think about this.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.460]   The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400]   by prescription or on your eyes are designed
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.920]   to focus the light onto your neural retina.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.660]   So let's think about why I'm making
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.920]   some of these recommendations
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.340]   because I think it can really empower you
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.240]   with the ability to change your behavior
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.880]   in terms of light viewing and other things,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.640]   depending on time of year,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.440]   depending on other lifestyle factors.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.320]   The important point to understand is that early in the day,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.560]   your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.140]   are looking for a lot of light.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.520]   Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.560]   in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.100]   So as all of you know,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.840]   the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.800]   So part of that day we're bathed in sunlight,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.620]   depending on where we are.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.240]   The other half of the day or part of the day
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.580]   we're in darkness.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.720]   The earth also travels around the sun.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.120]   365 days is the time that it takes one year
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.620]   to travel around that sun.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.820]   The earth is tilted.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.880]   It's not perfectly upright.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.920]   So the earth is tilted on its axis.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.500]   So depending on where we are in that 365 day journey,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.380]   and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere,
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.500]   Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.960]   some days of the year are longer than others.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.880]   Some are very short, some are very long.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.760]   If you're at the equator,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.840]   you experience less variation in day length
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.920]   and therefore night length.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.640]   And if you're closer to the poles,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.500]   you're going to experience some very long days.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.120]   And you're also going to experience some very short days,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   depending on which pole you're at
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.320]   and what time of year it is.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.640]   A simple way to put this is depending on time of year,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.960]   the days are either getting shorter or getting longer.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.100]   Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.680]   according to day length,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.880]   except your brain body and cells
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.540]   don't actually know anything about day length.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.680]   It only knows night length.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.960]   And here's how it works.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.660]   Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.480]   If days are long and getting longer,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.080]   that means melatonin is reduced.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.360]   If days are getting shorter,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.800]   that melatonin signal is getting longer.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   So every cell in your body actually knows external day length
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.740]   and therefore time of year
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.420]   by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.620]   By understanding that light and extended day length
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.940]   inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends to be associated
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.420]   with a more depressed or reduced functioning
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.060]   of these kind of activity driving and mood elevating signals
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.420]   and understanding that you have some control over melatonin
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.500]   by way of light, including sunlight,
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.020]   but also artificial light that should empower you,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.860]   I believe, to make the adjustments
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.540]   that if you're feeling low, you might ask,
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.500]   how much light am I getting?
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.140]   When am I getting that light?
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.500]   Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right?
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.340]   So you need sleep.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.420]   You can't just, you know,
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.460]   just crush melatonin across the board
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.620]   and expect to feel good
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.800]   because then you're not going to fall asleep
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.640]   and stay asleep.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.500]   Melatonin, not incidentally, comes from,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.260]   is synthesized from serotonin.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.340]   Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.020]   with feelings of wellbeing provided to proper levels,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020]   but wellbeing of a particular kind,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.940]   wellbeing associated with quiescence and calm
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.420]   and the feeling that we have enough resources
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.660]   in our immediate kind of conditions.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.720]   It's the kind of thing that comes from a good meal
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.780]   or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.300]   or conversing with somebody that you really bond with.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   Serotonin does not stimulate action.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.200]   It tends to stimulate stillness.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.880]   Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.740]   which is a reward, feel-good neuromodulator
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.300]   that stimulates action.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   And actually dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.900]   to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.020]   It's actually made from dopamine, right?
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.620]   So you can start to think about light as a signal
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.140]   that is very powerful for modulating things
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.220]   like sleep and wakefulness,
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.100]   but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.840]   And I talked about this previously,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.680]   but I'll mention once more
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.540]   that light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.060]   to the point where it can start causing problems
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.220]   with learning and memory and mood.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.340]   That's one powerful reason to avoid bright light
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.760]   in the middle of the night.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.960]   Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.820]   I've been mentioning neuromodulators,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.360]   things like serotonin and dopamine,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.380]   which tend to bias certain brain circuits
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.020]   and things in our body to happen
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.060]   and certain brain circuits
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.360]   and things in our body not to happen.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.060]   One of the ones I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrine,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.060]   which is a neuromodulator that tends to put us into action,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.580]   make us want to move.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.460]   In fact, when it's released in high amounts
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.320]   in our brain and body,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.260]   it can lead to what we call stress
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.960]   or the feeling of being stressed.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.900]   Several people ask me,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.380]   what's the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline?
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.980]   Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.940]   which sit right above our kidneys.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.140]   Epinephrine is the exact same molecule,
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.580]   except that it's released within the brain.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.660]   Epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.860]   and they tend to stimulate agitation
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.620]   and the desire to move.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.020]   Got a lot of questions about exercise.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.660]   What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well?
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.640]   When should I exercise, et cetera?
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.660]   There are basically two forms of exercise
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.500]   that we can talk about.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.320]   Although, of course,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.500]   I realize there are many different forms of exercise.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.780]   There's much more nuance to this,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.020]   but we can talk about cardiovascular exercise
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.060]   where the idea is to repeat a movement
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.560]   over and over and over continuously.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.940]   So that'd be like running, biking, rowing, cycling,
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.420]   this kind of thing.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.300]   Or there's a resistance exercise where you're moving,
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.060]   lifting, presumably putting down also,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.820]   things of progressively heavier and heavier weight
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.300]   that you couldn't do continuously for 30 minutes.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.740]   Now you will see some places,
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.700]   aerobic exercise is best done in the morning
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.180]   and weight training is best done in the afternoon.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.220]   I think there's far more individual variation than that.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.140]   I think there are, however, a couple of windows
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.100]   that the exercise science literature
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.140]   and the circadian literature points to
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.860]   as windows related to body temperature
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.740]   in which performance, injury,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.500]   in which performance is optimized,
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.600]   injury is reduced, and so on.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.540]   And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking,
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.300]   three hours after waking,
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.460]   and the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking,
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.980]   which is when temperature tends to peak.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.620]   A note about working out first thing in the morning.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.060]   Last time we talked about non-photic phase shifts.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.900]   If you exercise first thing in the morning,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.140]   your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.820]   There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.300]   that will lead you to want to wake up
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.060]   at the particular time that you exercised
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.700]   the previous three or four days.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.260]   So that can be a powerful tool,
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.380]   but you still want to get light exposure
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.700]   because it turns out that light and exercise converge
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.900]   to give an even bigger wake-up signal to the brain and body.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.700]   So you might want to think about that.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.940]   Some people find if they exercise late in the day,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.580]   they have trouble sleeping.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.540]   In general, intense exercise does that,
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.620]   whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn't.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.460]   Many of your questions were about neural plasticity,
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.340]   which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.940]   in response to experience.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.340]   There was a question that asked whether or not
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.820]   these really deep biological mechanisms
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.300]   around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.720]   were subject to neural plasticity, and indeed they are.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.580]   Some of that plasticity is short-term
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.900]   and some of it is more long-term.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.220]   There's a really good analogy here,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.220]   which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.020]   where every day, say at 8 a.m., noon, and 7 p.m.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.100]   is when you eat your food, not suggesting you do this,
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.380]   but let's say you were to do that for a couple days.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.100]   After a few days, you would start to anticipate
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.220]   those mealtimes where no matter where you were in the world,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.700]   no matter what was going on in your life,
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.980]   about five to 10 minutes before those mealtimes,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.900]   you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.380]   which is your body's way of trying to get you
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.020]   to forage for food.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.580]   And that's because of some peptide signals
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.180]   that come from the periphery from your body,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.060]   things like hypocretinorexin,
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.660]   that signal to the hypothalamus and brainstem
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.020]   to make you active and alert and look for food
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.400]   and feel hungry.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.980]   So there's kind of an anticipatory circuit
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.920]   that's a chemical circuit, but eventually over time,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.180]   the neurons, the neural circuits
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.820]   that control hypocretinorexin would get tuned
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.380]   to the neural circuits that are involved in eating
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.960]   and maybe even smell and taste
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.860]   to create a kind of eating circuit
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.340]   that's unique to your pattern, to your rhythms.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.020]   The same thing is true for these waking and exercise
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.700]   and other schedules, including ultradian schedules.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.660]   If you wake up in the morning
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.820]   and start getting your sunlight,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.100]   you start exercising in the morning
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.100]   or you exercise in the afternoon,
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.260]   pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.940]   and start to secrete hormones and other signals
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.260]   that prepare your body for the ensuing activity
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.280]   of waking up or going to sleep.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.960]   So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.800]   even if that rhythm isn't down to the minute,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.080]   you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.740]   and it becomes easier to wake up early if that's your thing
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.100]   or exercise at a particular day if that's your thing.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.120]   That's the beauty of neural plasticity.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.160]   A number of people asked,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.920]   "What can I do to increase plasticity?"
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.200]   And that really comes in two forms.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.860]   There's plasticity that we can access in sleep
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.080]   to improve rates of learning and depth of learning
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.980]   from the previous day or so.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.280]   And there's this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.960]   that can be done without sleeping
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.460]   to improve rates of learning and depth of retention, et cetera.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.680]   So let's consider those both
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.760]   and you can incorporate these protocols if you like.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.580]   Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.200]   First, let's talk about learning in sleep.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.340]   This is based on some work
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.840]   that I'll provide the reference for
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.620]   that was published in the journal "Science."
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.500]   Excellent journal.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.300]   Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.820]   done by others in his book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.580]   The studies, just to remind you,
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.660]   are structured the following way.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.220]   An individual is brought into a laboratory,
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.860]   does a spatial memory task.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.780]   So there tends to be a screen
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.560]   with a bunch of different objects
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.380]   popping up on the screen in different locations.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.980]   So it might be a bulldog's face,
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.000]   there might be a cat, then it might be an apple,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.180]   then it might be a pen in different locations.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.940]   And that sounds trivially easy,
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.600]   but with time, you can imagine it gets pretty tough
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.620]   to come back a day later and remember
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.060]   if something presented in a given location
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.500]   was something you've seen before
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.300]   and whether or not it was presented in that location
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   or a different location.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.020]   If you had enough objects and changed the locations enough,
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.140]   this can actually be quite difficult.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.420]   In this study, the subjects
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.260]   either just went through the experiment
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.820]   or a particular odor was released into the room
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.500]   while they were learning
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.980]   or a tone was played in the room while they were learning.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.780]   And then during the sleep of those subjects
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.540]   the following night and the following night,
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.220]   this was done repeatedly for several nights,
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.860]   the same odor or tone was played
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.820]   while the subjects were sleeping.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.420]   They did this in different stages of sleep,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.660]   non-REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.460]   They did this with just the tone in sleep.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.940]   If the subjects had the odor, but not the tone,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.420]   they did it with putting the tone.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.200]   If they had the odor while learning,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.420]   so basically all the controls,
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.000]   all the things you'd want to see done
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.140]   to make sure that it wasn't some indirect effect,
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.400]   some modulatory effect, okay?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   And what they found was that providing the same stimulus,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.480]   the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.440]   if the subjects heard a tone while learning,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.980]   if they just delivered that odor or tone
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.940]   while the subjects slept,
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.460]   rates of learning and retention of information
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.140]   was significantly greater.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.060]   This is pretty cool.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.300]   What this means that you can cue the subconscious brain,
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.460]   the asleep brain to learn particular things better
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.820]   and faster.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.120]   So how might you implement this?
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.340]   Well, you could play with this if you want.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.980]   I don't see any real challenge to this
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.820]   provided the odor is a safe one
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.980]   and it doesn't wake you up
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.060]   and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.060]   You could do this by having a metronome, for instance,
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.460]   while learning something,
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.340]   playing in the background or particular music,
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.020]   and then have that very faintly while you sleep.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.820]   So you could apply this if you like and try this.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.220]   The other form of neuroplasticity
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.380]   is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.900]   by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep,
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.580]   but the neuroplasticity that you can access
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.620]   with non-sleep deep rest.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.640]   So NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.820]   as well as short 20-minute naps,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.980]   which are very close to non-sleep deep rest
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.660]   because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.480]   during short naps unless they're very sleep deprived.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.340]   NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.420]   when done for 20-minute bouts
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.860]   to match an approximately 90-minute bout of learning.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.140]   So what am I talking about?
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.220]   90-minute cycles are these ultradian cycles
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.840]   that I've talked about previously.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.060]   And we tend to learn very well
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.960]   by taking a 90-minute cycle,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.940]   transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.780]   when it's hard to focus,
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.620]   and then deep focus and learning
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.760]   feels almost like agitation and strain.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.060]   And then by the end of that 90-minute cycle,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.160]   it becomes very hard to maintain focus
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.140]   and learn more information.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.460]   There's a study published in Cell Reports last year,
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.340]   a great journal, excellent paper,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.740]   showing that 20-minute naps
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.460]   or light sleep of the sort of non-sleep deep rest
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.540]   taken immediately after, or close to,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.660]   it doesn't have to be immediately
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.580]   after you finish the last sentence of learning
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.540]   or whatever it is, or bar of music,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.660]   but a couple minutes after transitioning
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.380]   to a period of non-sleep deep rest
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.420]   where you're turning off the analysis
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.660]   of duration, path, and outcome
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.860]   has been shown to accelerate learning
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.460]   to a significant degree,
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.180]   both the amount of information
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.140]   and the retention of that information.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.720]   So that's pretty cool
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.500]   because this is a cost-free, drug-free way
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.000]   of accelerating learning without having to get more sleep,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.100]   but simply by introducing these 20-minute bouts.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.140]   I would encourage people, if they want to try this,
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.680]   to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.320]   of Ultradian learning cycle,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.860]   which brings us to the next thing
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.700]   about learning and plasticity,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.780]   which is nootropics, aka smart drugs.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.860]   Ah, this is a big topic.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.860]   That sigh was a sigh of concern
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.820]   about how to address nootropics
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.340]   in a thorough enough, but thoughtful enough way.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.740]   There are elements to learning
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.980]   that we've discussed here before that are very concrete.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.380]   Things like the ability to focus
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.420]   and put the blinders on to everything else
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.300]   that's happening around you and in your head mainly, right?
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.040]   Distractions about things you should be doing,
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.900]   could be doing, or might be doing,
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.060]   and focus on what you need to do.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.540]   And then that's required
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.460]   for triggering the acetylcholine neuromodulator
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.380]   that will then allow you to highlight
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.380]   the particular synapses
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.460]   that will then later change in sleep.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.460]   So no nootropic allows you to bypass the need
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.480]   for sleep and deep rest.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.900]   That's important to understand.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.180]   Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.360]   a bunch of things together.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.740]   Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.120]   You can't just ingest more stimulant to be more focused.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.080]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.560]   Most nootropics also include things that increase
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.960]   or are designed to increase acetylcholine.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.620]   Things like alpha-GPC and other things of that sort.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.360]   And indeed, there's some evidence
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.240]   that they can increase acetylcholine.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.040]   So we need the focus component.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.280]   We need the alertness component.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.120]   The alertness component comes from epinephrine,
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.560]   traditionally from caffeine stimulation.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.400]   The acetylcholine stimulation traditionally comes
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.120]   from choline donors or alpha-GPC, things of that sort.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.320]   And then you would want to have some sort of off switch
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.200]   because anything that's going to really stimulate
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.680]   your alertness that then provides a crash,
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.200]   that crash is not a crash into the deep kind
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.840]   of restful slumber that you would want for learning.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.820]   It's a crash into the kind of,
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.120]   let's just call it lopsided sleep,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.840]   meaning it's deep sleep, but it lacks certain spindles
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.480]   and other elements of the physiology sleep spindles
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.000]   that really engage the learning process
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.200]   and the reconfiguration of synapses.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   So right now, my stance on nootropics is that maybe,
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.880]   maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you,
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.800]   I'm not recommending it, but in general,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.880]   it tends to use more of a shotgun approach
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.080]   than is probably going to be useful for learning
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.040]   and memory in the long run.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.480]   Okay, I'd like to continue by talking about the role
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.640]   of temperature in sleep, accessing sleep,
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.360]   staying asleep and wakefulness.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.800]   Temperature is super interesting as it relates
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.240]   to circadian rhythms and wakefulness and sleep.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.200]   First, let's take a look at what's happening
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   to our body temperature across each 24 hour cycle.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.400]   In general, our temperature tends to be lowest
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.280]   right around 4 a.m. and starts creeping up around 6 a.m.,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   8 a.m. and peaks sometime between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.960]   There's also an important way in which temperature
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   matches day length.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.000]   In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.720]   Not always, but in general, that's the way it is.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.160]   And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.880]   So temperature and day length are also linked.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.280]   Metabolically, they're linked.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.200]   Biologically, they're linked, excuse me.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.760]   And atmospherically, they're linked
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.120]   for the reasons that we talked about before
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.400]   about duration of day length
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.880]   and other climate features and so forth.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.920]   So one of the most powerful things
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.200]   about setting your circadian rhythm properly
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.640]   is that your temperature will start to fall
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.840]   into a regular rhythm.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.860]   And that temperature has a very strong effect
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.720]   on things like metabolism and when you will feel
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.840]   most willing and interested in exercising.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.600]   Typically, the willingness to exercise and engage
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.680]   in any kind of activity, mental or physical,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.040]   is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.640]   when the slope of that line is greatest.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   That's why 30 minutes after waking
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.760]   is one of those key windows,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.480]   as well as three hours after waking,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.800]   and then when temperature actually peaks,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   which is generally, generally, about 11 hours after waking.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.000]   So this is why we say that temperature
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.840]   and circadian rhythm are linked,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.760]   but they're actually even more linked than that.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   We've talked before about how light enters the eye,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.560]   triggers activation of these melanopsin cells,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.840]   which then triggers activation
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.360]   of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.120]   the master circadian clock.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.080]   And then I always say the master circadian clock
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.280]   informs all the cells and tissues of your body
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.200]   and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.520]   But what I've never answered
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.120]   was how it actually puts them into that rhythm.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.800]   And it does it two ways.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.600]   One is it secretes a peptide.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.920]   A peptide is just a little protein
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.840]   that floats through the bloodstream
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.080]   and signals to the cells.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.960]   But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.100]   under which those cells exist.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.440]   So temperature is actually the effector
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.080]   of the circadian rhythm.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.320]   Nowadays, there's some interest in cold showers
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.440]   and ice baths.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.740]   Getting into an ice bath is very interesting
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.200]   because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.380]   Now you should know from the previous episode
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.680]   that as that temperature increases,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.640]   it will shift your circadian rhythm
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.800]   and which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.640]   will depend on whether or not
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.440]   you're doing it during the daytime or late in the day.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.560]   If you do it after 8 p.m.,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.380]   it's going to make your day longer, right?
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.980]   Because your body and your central clocks
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.600]   are used to temperature going up
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.240]   early in the day and throughout the day
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.440]   and peaking in the afternoon.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.760]   If you then increase that further
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.740]   or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8 p.m.,
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.880]   after temperature was already falling,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.220]   even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple degrees,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.440]   or you do that with exercise,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.020]   doesn't have to be with the ice bath,
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.460]   you are extending, you are shifting forward,
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.940]   you're phase delaying your clock,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.580]   you're convincing your clock
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.980]   and therefore the rest of your body
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.180]   that the day is still going, right?
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.620]   You're giving it the perception,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.500]   the cellular and physiological perception
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.620]   that the day is getting longer
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.220]   and you will want to naturally stay up later
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.820]   and wake up later.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.020]   So for those of you that are having trouble getting up,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.540]   and this is going to almost sound laughable,
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.380]   but a cold shower first thing in the morning
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.620]   will wake you up,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.220]   but that's waking you up in the short term
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.540]   because of a different mechanism,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.940]   which I'll talk about in a moment,
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.620]   but it also is shifting your clock,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.180]   it's phase advancing your clock
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.420]   in a way that makes you more likely
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.540]   to get up earlier the next day.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.520]   It's going to make you want to wake up
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.040]   about half hour to an hour earlier the next day
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.940]   than you normally would.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.820]   Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling,
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.220]   it will tend to delay and make your body perceive
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.120]   as if the day is getting longer.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.300]   But temperature is, again,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   it's not just one tool to manipulate wake up time
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.480]   and circadian rhythm and metabolism.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.780]   It is the effector.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.900]   It is the way that the central circadian clock
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.000]   impacts all the cells and tissues of your body.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.460]   Light is the trigger.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.980]   The suprachiasmatic nucleus
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.460]   is the master circadian clock
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.780]   that mediates all these changes.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.700]   Also influenced by non-photic influence
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.100]   like exercise and feeding and things of that sort.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.780]   But temperature is the effector.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.180]   Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.240]   When you travel and you land in a new location
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.220]   and your schedule is inverted 12 hours,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.060]   one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.340]   is to get onto the local meal schedule.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.900]   Now that probably has to do with two effects.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.180]   One are changes in temperature
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.740]   and eating-induced increases in body temperature.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.580]   Now you should understand why that would work.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.400]   As well as eating has this anticipatory secretion
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.260]   of hypercretinorexin that I talked about earlier.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.420]   Many people asked questions about food and neurotransmitters
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.520]   and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness and mood,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.520]   which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.920]   But I'm going to try and distill out
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.280]   the most common questions.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.960]   We've talked a lot about neuromodulators
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.900]   like dopamine, acetylcholine and norepinephrine.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.340]   You may notice in those discussions
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.060]   that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.780]   Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.580]   It comes from the foods that we eat.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.860]   Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.020]   It comes from the foods that we eat.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.340]   And then once we ingest them,
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.940]   those compounds circulate to a variety
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.900]   of different cells and tissues.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.500]   But it is true that our food and the particular foods we eat
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.940]   can influence things like neuromodulator levels
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.260]   to some extent.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.580]   Nuts and meats, in particular red meats,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.900]   tend to be rich in things like tyrosine, right?
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.180]   That tells you right there
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.500]   that because tyrosine is the precursor of dopamine
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.100]   and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.500]   and epinephrine,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.900]   that those foods tend to lend themselves
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.080]   toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.340]   and the sorts of things
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.980]   that are associated with wakefulness.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.500]   Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.860]   also impacts our wakefulness.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.700]   If we eat a lot of anything,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.760]   whether or not it's ribeye steaks, rice or cardboard,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.020]   please don't eat cardboard,
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.140]   your stomach, if it's very distended,
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.460]   will draw a lot of blood into your gut
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.920]   and you will divert blood from other tissues
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.000]   and you'll become sleepy.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.540]   So it's not just about food content,
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.920]   it's also about food volume, all right?
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   Fasting states generally are associated
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.980]   with more alertness, epinephrine and so forth.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.540]   And fed states are generally associated
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.900]   with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.900]   and the kind of things that lend themselves
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.940]   more towards sleep and less toward alertness.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.480]   And fed states are generally associated
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.660]   with more quiescence and relaxation,
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.200]   serotonin and the kind of things
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.520]   that lend themselves more towards sleep
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.460]   and less toward alertness.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.560]   There are a couple effects of food that are independent,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.180]   or I should say a couple effects of eating,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.120]   'cause the food won't do it
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.280]   when it's sitting across the table,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.900]   but of eating that are powerful
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.060]   for modulating circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.380]   And that's because every time we eat,
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.940]   we get eating-induced thermogenesis
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.260]   regardless of what we eat.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.220]   And now you know from the discussion about temperature
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.100]   that if you're eating early in the day,
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.500]   so that you'll want to wake up earlier the next day.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.380]   If you're eating very late in the day,
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.660]   even if you can fall asleep after that,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.620]   there's a tendency for you
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.660]   to want to sleep later the next day.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.100]   So as we finish up,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.480]   I just want to offer you the opportunity
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.780]   to do an experiment.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.500]   It might be interesting, just a suggestion,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.900]   to write down for each day
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.640]   when you went outside to get sunlight
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.900]   and when you did that relative to wakings.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.960]   And then you might just take note of when you exercised,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.460]   and you might note
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.300]   when you might've felt chilled or cold if you do,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.320]   or you might've felt particularly hot,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.480]   or if you woke up in the middle of night
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.500]   when you felt particularly hot.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.240]   And then the last thing you might want to do
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.540]   is just write down
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.260]   if and when you did a non-sleep-deep-rest protocol,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.440]   an SDR protocol,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.340]   anything that you're using
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.220]   to deliberately teach your nervous system
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.680]   how to go from more alertness to more calmness
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.980]   in the waking state.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.820]   By doing this,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.260]   you can start to reveal some really interesting patterns.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.420]   It's really about taking the patterns of behaviors,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.780]   of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise,
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.340]   and superimposing that
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.580]   on what you're learning in this podcast
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.960]   and elsewhere, of course,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.180]   and what you already know,
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.560]   and trying to see where certain problems
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.940]   or pain points might be arising.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.380]   Maybe you start to find that using cold exposure
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.060]   early in the day is great for you,
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.220]   but using it late,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.060]   if it's too late in the day, that's not great.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.580]   Or if you're into the sauna,
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.940]   or even like some people, including myself,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.020]   if I take a hot shower
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.560]   or sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.820]   well, then I get a compensatory decrease in body temperature
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.860]   and I sleep great,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.420]   provided I hydrate well enough,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.140]   'cause that can be kind of a dehydrating thing
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.420]   to sit in hot conditions.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.800]   But if I do the sauna early in the day,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.900]   unless I exercise immediately afterward,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.780]   then I tend to get the temperature drop,
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.620]   which makes sense because we can get in the sauna,
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.580]   you get vasodilation, you throw off a lot of heat,
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.420]   and then you generally get
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.840]   a compensatory drop in temperature.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.860]   If you do that early in the day,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.420]   that's right about the time that that temperature
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.800]   is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.100]   So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.660]   of your own physiology, of your own brain and body,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.980]   and seeing how the various tools
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   that you may or may not be using
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.740]   are affecting your patterns of sleep,
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.060]   your patterns of attention and wakefulness.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.700]   It's vitally important that if you do this,
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.100]   that you know that it's not about trying to get onto
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.120]   an extremely rigid schedule.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.660]   It's really about trying to identify variables
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   that are most powerful for you
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.900]   and that push you in the direction that you want to go,
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.060]   and changing the variables that are pushing your body
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.240]   and your mind in the directions that you don't want to go.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.980]   Self-experimentation is something
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.560]   that should be done slowly, carefully.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360]   You don't want to be reckless about this.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.920]   And this is where I would say
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.200]   manipulating one or two variables at a time
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   is really going to be best,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.980]   as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.480]   to really identify what it is that's most powerful for you.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.240]   And above all, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.820]   [upbeat music]
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.400]   (upbeat music)
