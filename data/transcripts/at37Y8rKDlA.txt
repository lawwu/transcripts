[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.060]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.260]   Today, we're discussing water.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.220]   Now, to some of you, water might seem like a boring topic,
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.060]   but I assure you that water is anything
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.940]   but a boring topic.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.740]   In fact, water as a substance is incredibly interesting
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.300]   for a variety of reasons that I'll explain today.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.460]   In fact, we are going to discuss
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.540]   the physics and chemistry of water,
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.840]   and I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.300]   regardless of whether or not you have a physics
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.840]   or chemistry background.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.740]   And I will discuss how your body needs and utilizes water,
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.460]   depending on what type of water you drink,
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.720]   the temperature of that water, when you drink the water,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.500]   and indeed, how you drink that water.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.340]   Now, water is actually a pretty controversial topic.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.140]   In fact, in preparing for this episode,
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.960]   which took me several months, in fact,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.020]   I ran into highly contradictory information
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.700]   and had to go on some real deep dives
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.060]   in order to ferret out the best
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.260]   and most accurate knowledge for you.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.420]   I also found that there are generally two camps
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.740]   of people out there in terms of how they think about water
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.400]   and the consumption of water.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.960]   One camp, generally speaking,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.980]   is of the mind that tap water is completely safe.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.600]   Perhaps it needs a little bit of filtering,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.740]   but that in most areas of the world,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.980]   if it runs out of the tap,
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980]   and unless there's a warning sign directly above the faucet,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.320]   that you can drink the tap water.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840]   The other camp seems to be the camp
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.000]   that does not trust anything that comes out of the tap
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.140]   and is excited by, and in fact,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.120]   relies on things like reverse osmosis, deuterium depleted,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.240]   hydrogen rich, or other forms of water
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.920]   that sometimes can be very expensive,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.220]   or at least involve some substantial steps
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.800]   in order to clean, filter, alter the chemistry of,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   or in some other way, adjust
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.320]   before they are willing to consume it.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.280]   So today, what we're going to try and do
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460]   is to address all the stances around water.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.760]   For instance, we will discuss
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.280]   whether or not tap water is indeed safe,
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.460]   and I will give you some tools that will allow you
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.480]   to address whether or not
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.280]   the water coming out of your tap is safe,
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.780]   as well as some tools that will allow you to address
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.220]   how to clean that water
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.720]   if indeed it does need filtering and cleaning,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.840]   in particular for things like fluorides
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.100]   and endocrine disruptors,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.800]   which it turns out are quite prominent in a lot, not all,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.200]   but a lot of tap water sources.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600]   I will also talk about
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.160]   the more quote unquote esoteric forms of water
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.440]   that I mentioned a few minutes ago.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   So I will go systematically through the list
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.760]   of distilled, reverse osmosis, spring water,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.920]   deuterium depleted water, high pH water,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.640]   and for those of you that are already screaming out
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.800]   as you hear this, "Oh no, he's going to tell us
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.920]   that pH water can alter the pH of our body in helpful ways,"
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.480]   I'm not going to tell you that,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.520]   but I will tell you that the alkalinity
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.740]   or acidity of the water,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.840]   that is the pH of the water that you drink,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   has a profound impact on your ability
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.400]   to absorb and utilize that water
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640]   and the impact that those water molecules have
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.340]   on specific biological systems.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.600]   So it turns out pH is very important,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.060]   but not for the reasons
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.480]   that you've probably heard about previously.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.160]   I will talk about how the temperature of water
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   that you drink does indeed turn out to be important
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.140]   for the rate of absorption of that water
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.920]   and its impact on the cells, tissues,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.960]   and organs of your body and thereby your health.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.440]   And I will talk about various zero cost and low cost tools
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.080]   that you can use in order to get the most
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.580]   out of the water that you drink.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.000]   And finally, I will talk about
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.680]   when and how to hydrate your body best.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   Before we dive into today's topic,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.760]   I want to share with you some very interesting results
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.880]   that were just published
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.240]   on the use of deliberate cold exposure to benefit fat loss.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.040]   Now, deliberate cold exposure is a topic
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.440]   I've covered before in this podcast.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.900]   We have an entire episode about that
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.120]   that I've linked in the show note captions.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.800]   Deliberate cold exposure can be done by way of cold showers
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   or immersion in cold or ice water up to the neck.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   And that's typically the ways that it's done.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.780]   It has been shown to reduce inflammation,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.640]   to increase metabolism.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   And I think some of the most exciting results
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.260]   that have been published are the results,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.360]   certainly in humans showing that deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.340]   can increase the release of so-called catecholamines,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.440]   which are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   And those increases in those three molecules
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.600]   are quite long lasting and lead to substantial increases
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.620]   in mood and focus throughout the day.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.380]   Now, many people out there hear
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.700]   about deliberate cold exposure and cringe.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.360]   Other people hear about it and cringe
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.540]   because they've heard that deliberate cold exposure,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.660]   especially by way of immersion in water,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.420]   can block the adaptation to strength
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420]   or hypertrophy training.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.520]   What I mean by that is yes, indeed,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.900]   there are data showing that if one gets into very cold water
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.540]   up to the neck in the six hours,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.080]   anytime that is in the six hours
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.240]   after strength or hypertrophy training,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880]   that some of the strength and hypertrophy increases
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   that one would observe are blocked
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.300]   by that deliberate cold exposure.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.280]   However, after six hours does not seem to be a problem.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.000]   So it can be done on other days
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.740]   besides the strength and hypertrophy training.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.720]   It can be done before strength and hypertrophy training.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.900]   It can be done after endurance work.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.920]   And I should mention that it does not appear
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   that cold showers disrupt the adaptations
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.340]   to strength and hypertrophy training,
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.160]   even if they are done immediately after strength
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.240]   or hypertrophy training.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.520]   Okay, with that said, many people do enjoy the effects
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.600]   of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.100]   in particular for those increases in mood and alertness
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.740]   that are the consequence of those increases
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.800]   in the catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.000]   and epinephrine.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.340]   And again, those increases are very long lasting.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.900]   So it's not just during the exposure to cold,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.620]   it is for several hours, up to four,
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.080]   maybe even five or six hours,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   depending on how cold and how long
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.400]   the deliberate cold exposure happens to be.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.480]   Again, there's a lot to say and explore
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.940]   about deliberate cold exposure.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.440]   So again, I'll just refer you to the episode
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.800]   on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.680]   If you want to explore the mechanisms
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.460]   and the positive health outcomes,
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.860]   some of the controversies within the data, et cetera,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.200]   within that episode.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.380]   Meanwhile, I definitely want to share with you the results
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.760]   of this recent study that just came out.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.460]   The title of this study is impact of cold exposure
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.480]   on life satisfaction and physical composition of soldiers.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.380]   The reason this study is very interesting
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.440]   is that it's one of the few studies that used,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   or I should say explored both deliberate cold exposure
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.660]   by immersion in cold water,
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.000]   as well as deliberate cold exposure by way of cold showers
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.220]   as it relates to weight loss.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.720]   Now there's already data out there
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.400]   on the effects of deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.460]   And here I'm mainly referring to the beautiful work
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.920]   of Dr. Susanna Soberg and colleagues in Scandinavia
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.360]   that showed that people that do 11 minutes total
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.560]   of deliberate cold exposure by immersion in cold water
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.840]   up to the neck per week.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.420]   So 11 minutes per week total,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.040]   spread out across some different sessions
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.820]   by way of getting into water that's uncomfortably cold
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.580]   up to the neck and then getting out
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.020]   and then doing that several times per week
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.120]   to hit that 11 minutes or more threshold.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.520]   And, and this is very important,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.660]   we'll come up in a moment in the context of this new study,
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.960]   and warming up, not by getting into a warm shower,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.440]   which is frankly what I do after my cold showers
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.780]   or getting into the ice bath or cold water immersion,
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.340]   but rather forcing their body to warm up naturally
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.760]   by using its own metabolic abilities.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   In those studies, they observed substantial increases
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.380]   in brown fat stores, which are fat stores
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.320]   that you really want around the heart and clavicles,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.760]   increases in metabolism that were quite dramatic,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.720]   in my opinion, and that could be very beneficial
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.600]   for allowing people to feel more comfortable
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   at cold temperatures when they're not in cold water
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.000]   and on and on.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.120]   So lots of benefits shown in that study.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.640]   In this study, what I thought was particularly interesting
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   is again, they explored both immersion in cold water
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.560]   and cold showers and the duration of cold exposure
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.080]   that they found led to substantial fat loss,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.120]   especially around the abdomen,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.440]   was very brief deliberate cold exposure.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.800]   Let me give you a few details about this study.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.120]   The study involved 49 subjects
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   that include both males and females.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.240]   This is also really important.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.100]   The beautiful work of Susanna Soberg and colleagues,
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.100]   as far as I know, only looked at males.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.740]   This study looked at males and females.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.900]   They were 19 to 30 years old
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.820]   and there basically were two groups.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.700]   People either were assigned to get deliberate cold exposure
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.000]   or they were not assigned to deliberate cold exposure.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.980]   The form of deliberate cold exposure
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.500]   involved one session per week of cold immersion
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.520]   in cold water up to the neck.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.980]   And to just give you a sense of how cold it was,
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.780]   it was three degrees Celsius,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.680]   which translates to about 37 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.940]   That's pretty darn cold, but it was only for two minutes.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.900]   Okay, so one session at three degrees Celsius,
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.580]   otherwise known as 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.680]   for two minutes every week, once a week.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.920]   In addition, the same subjects
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.260]   did five cold showers per week
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.600]   or a minimum of five cold showers per week.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.640]   And those cold showers were slightly warmer
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.220]   than the immersion in cold water condition.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.500]   So they were 10 degrees Celsius approximately
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.840]   or 50 degrees Fahrenheit, still pretty cold.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   And the duration of that cold water exposure in the shower
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.320]   was just for 30 seconds.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.280]   Okay, so this is interesting to me
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.560]   because many people don't have access
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.740]   to cold water immersion.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.960]   They might not have an ice bath
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.820]   or any place they can do that,
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.500]   but most people do have access
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.580]   to a cold shower of some sort.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.940]   Plus I think most people could do
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.620]   probably one ice bath per week
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.140]   or find a place where they could get into cold water safely.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.580]   Now, I should point out that some people will not do well
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.140]   going into 37.5 degree Fahrenheit,
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.200]   AKA three degrees Celsius water,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.960]   having never done anything like this before.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.180]   So if you're going to try and employ
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.420]   these sorts of protocols that were used in the study,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.940]   I do recommend that you ease into it
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.580]   over the course of a week or so
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.940]   and become somewhat adapted
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.380]   to the shock of cold water exposure.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.140]   So maybe start at 50 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.480]   kind of ease your way back
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.080]   in terms of the cold water immersion especially.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.760]   Now, another critical feature of this study
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   is as with the beautiful work by Susanna Soburg,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   the subjects were told to warm up naturally
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.260]   after the deliberate cold exposure.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.520]   So they basically hung out
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.960]   outside of the cold water immersion
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.980]   or outside of the cold shower for 10 minutes
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.440]   after they were exposed to the cold in their bathing suit
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.000]   or I'm assuming they were wearing something.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.140]   But the point is that you are not going
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.180]   from deliberate cold exposure directly into a hot shower
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.960]   or a sauna or something of that sort.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.060]   So again, their bodies were forced to heat up again,
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.380]   naturally after the deliberate cold exposure,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.100]   but after the 10 minute period,
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.160]   they were able to do whatever they wanted,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.500]   essentially re-clothe, take a warm shower
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.760]   and so on and go about their day.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.060]   Now, the results of this deliberate cold exposure protocol,
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.500]   again, two minutes in cold immersion
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.640]   at three degrees Celsius, 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.980]   plus five cold showers per week of two minutes long,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.980]   a little bit warmer, 10 degrees Celsius,
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.180]   50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.500]   Now, the deliberate cold exposure used in this study
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.640]   caused many different
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.260]   statistically significant positive changes.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.920]   They had a very extensive questionnaire
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.280]   that related to mood, everything from levels of anxiety
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.560]   to sexual satisfaction and on and on.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.740]   In fact, they saw a statistically significant improvement
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.120]   in sexual satisfaction in the subjects
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.020]   that were exposed to deliberate cold exposure,
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.420]   not in the control group.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.380]   Although they didn't look at this,
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.940]   chances are those improvements in sexual satisfaction
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.380]   were the downstream consequence of the known increases
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.700]   in testosterone and free testosterone
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.780]   that occur in both men and women
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.980]   who do this sorts of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.380]   Again, testosterone being an important hormone
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.540]   for libido in both men and women.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.900]   They also saw improvements in regulation of anxiety,
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.320]   which I think is very interesting
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.840]   given that the deliberate cold exposure
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.500]   often causes people anxiety,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.240]   but here and in other studies,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.040]   we've seen it can lead to a better ability
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.860]   to buffer against anxiety
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.040]   in the normal happenings of everyday life.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   Perhaps the most interesting and significant results
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.000]   that they found in the study, however,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.420]   were that in particular in men,
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.460]   there was a reduction in waist circumference
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.860]   following eight weeks of this deliberate cold exposure,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.820]   as well as a 5.5% on average,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.060]   5.5% reduction in abdominal fat
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.380]   that was quite statistically significant
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.600]   when compared to the other groups.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.260]   Now, why there was no observed reduction in abdominal fat
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.460]   or waist circumference in the female subjects isn't clear,
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.420]   could have to do with just the way that body fat
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.640]   is stored and metabolized in females versus males.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.160]   That is going to be a topic for future exploration.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.880]   So I do think this study is very interesting
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.020]   because when you look at the landscape of science
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.240]   and discussion around deliberate cold exposure,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.820]   I think there's a general consensus now
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.240]   that deliberate cold exposure
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.300]   can change one's sense of mood and wellbeing
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.220]   through these increases in catecholamines
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.460]   that I mentioned earlier,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.220]   but the impact on metabolism itself
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.460]   has been somewhat controversial
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.580]   because the overall changes in metabolism that are observed,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.340]   while statistically significant in many studies,
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.020]   have not ever really been shown to translate
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.840]   into weight loss or body fat loss
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.220]   in any kind of specific way.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.280]   And of course, a great advantage of this study
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.300]   is that by exploring soldiers,
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.840]   they were able to really hold constant
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.900]   a number of other features
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.200]   like the amount of daily activity
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.400]   that those soldiers are exposed to,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.520]   their diet, their living conditions,
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.500]   and so on and so forth.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.900]   So at least in so far as human studies are done,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.660]   it's a very well-controlled study.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.800]   We'll provide a link to the study in the show note captions.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.700]   And for those of you that are thinking about
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.500]   employing the protocol that's used in this particular paper
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.100]   or combining it with existing
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.820]   deliberate cold exposure protocols,
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.260]   to me, it seems pretty straightforward
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.920]   and a pretty minimal time investment.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.740]   Just two minutes of deliberate cold exposure
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.900]   by way of water immersion up to the neck
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.620]   and five times a week of 30 seconds each
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.020]   of deliberate cold exposure by way of cold shower.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.860]   And just a quick mention about cold showers.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.760]   If you're going to use cold showers
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.900]   to do deliberate cold exposure,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.900]   you're going to want to stand under the shower itself, right?
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.220]   And essentially have it hit your head,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.760]   the back of your neck and your upper back,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.140]   which is where most of your brown fat stores
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.960]   are concentrated.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.180]   It turns out that cold exposure
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.260]   to those regions of the body in particular
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.700]   are going to trigger the adaptation
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.220]   of increased brown fat stores,
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.380]   which involves increases in mitochondria in those fat.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.680]   Again, this is not the blubbery fat beneath the skin.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.380]   This is the fat that acts as kind of an oil in the furnace
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.320]   that is your thermogenic properties of your body
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.820]   to generate heat and burn off so-called white adipose tissue
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.000]   elsewhere in the body.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.740]   Now, anyone that understands the laws of physics
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.600]   and thermodynamics will be saying,
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.040]   wait, in order to get fat loss,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.240]   you need to have a caloric deficit.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.040]   The calories in, calories out still applies.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.920]   And yes, that's absolutely true.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.780]   We can only conclude on the basis of the results
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.540]   of this study that the people that lost body fat
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.440]   were indeed in a caloric deficit,
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.520]   presumably because all other factors
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.460]   were held more or less constant in this group of soldiers,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   presumably because the deliberate cold exposure itself
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.060]   elevated metabolism,
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.640]   thereby increasing the calories out component
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.820]   of the calories in, calories out equation,
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.260]   which of course governs the rules of weight loss
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.220]   and body fat loss as well.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.820]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.580]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.820]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.300]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.960]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.020]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.840]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.760]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.560]   and nothing you don't.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.700]   That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.560]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.400]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.240]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.900]   in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.200]   also called neurons.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.760]   In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.660]   all three electrolytes need to be present
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.120]   in the proper ratios.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.800]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.600]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.120]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.220]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram, of sodium,
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.740]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.780]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.920]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.700]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.960]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.480]   and after physical training as well,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.320]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.300]   if you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.880]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.180]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.340]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.120]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesus.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.140]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.820]   Now, nootropics is a word that I don't like.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.780]   I don't like it because it means smart drugs.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.500]   And as a neuroscientist,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.580]   we know that we have brain circuits for focus,
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.540]   brain circuits that enable creativity,
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.220]   brain circuits that allow task switching and on and on.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.220]   So there's really no such thing as a brain circuit
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.060]   for being smart.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.680]   Now, Thesus understands this
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.960]   and has designed custom nootropics
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.500]   that are designed to get your brain and body
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.920]   into the optimal state for the specific types of work
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.620]   that is physical or cognitive work that you want to do.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.260]   I've been using Thesus for more than a year now,
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.700]   and it's completely changed the way that I approach work.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.580]   I typically take the clarity formula
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.940]   prior to doing any kind of cognitive work,
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.260]   and I'll take their energy formula often before workouts.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.100]   If you'd like to try
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.840]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.100]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.900]   and take their brief three-minute quiz.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.420]   That quiz will allow them
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.560]   to send you four different trial formulas
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.820]   that you can use for a month,
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.140]   and then you can iterate with them
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.900]   to find the ideal nootropic formulas for you.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.300]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.020]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.180]   to get 10% off your first order.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.000]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.180]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.200]   Now, many people have heard of the ketogenic diet,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.740]   and indeed the ketogenic diet has been useful
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.940]   for many people out there.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.940]   However, most people out there, including myself,
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.660]   do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.140]   That is, I eat carbohydrates.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.180]   However, it's important to note
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.660]   that even if you are not on a ketogenic diet,
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.840]   you can benefit from increasing your blood ketones.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.820]   In fact, I'll use ketone IQ after lunch or in the afternoon
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.340]   with some coffee or sometimes first thing in the morning.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.660]   If I'm particularly hungry and I want to do exercise
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.940]   or I want to do cognitive work,
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.900]   but I want to delay my first meal,
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.120]   using ketone IQ allows me to curb my hunger
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.900]   and gives me a lot of focus and energy.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.480]   And that's because ketones are one of the brain's
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.660]   preferred fuels for cognitive work.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.660]   In fact, ketones have been shown to be associated
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.620]   with forebrain function,
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.380]   which is associated with context switching,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.680]   focus and formulations of strategies, et cetera,
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.980]   all the sorts of things that are important
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.680]   for doing deliberate focused work or physical performance.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.240]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,

[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.740]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.960]   with Momentus Supplements.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.280]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.500]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.140]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.700]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.080]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.260]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.360]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.580]   Let's talk about water.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.500]   And let's start off by answering the question,
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.940]   what is water?
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.820]   Water is of course H2O.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.540]   Most everybody knows that from an early age.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.420]   But what H2O means is that each molecule of water
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.500]   consists of two hydrogens and one oxygen.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.580]   Now the physical arrangement of those two hydrogens
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.220]   and one oxygen turns out to be really important
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   for how water functions in the body
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.120]   and frankly elsewhere in our world and life.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.460]   If you were to make a peace symbol,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.740]   that is to put up your index finger
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.020]   and your middle finger simultaneously.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.660]   In fact, I'm going to recommend you do that now,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.540]   unless you're using your hands for something else important,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.620]   in which case do it later.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.620]   Well, if you make that peace symbol
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.940]   and you look at your hand,
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.700]   you have a pretty good impression
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.260]   of what an individual water molecule consists of,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.380]   which is H2O, two hydrogens and an oxygen.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.620]   And with that peace symbol, the fingers,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.860]   or the tips of your fingers rather,
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.180]   are going to represent the hydrogens.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.580]   Your fingers, that is the length of each of those fingers,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.080]   is going to represent the electron bonds to the oxygen
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.000]   and the palm of your hand and the fingers that are down
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.340]   are going to represent the oxygen, okay?
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.080]   Now what's important about that visual impression
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.220]   or visual image of the individual water molecule
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.740]   is that it is polarized.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.500]   That is the hydrogens over on one side,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.140]   both of them are over on one side
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.440]   and the oxygen is over on another.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.180]   And what's really important about water molecules
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.260]   being polarized is that they can bind to one another
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.500]   by way of that polarization.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.660]   And this has to do with something that we all kind of learned
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.340]   in chemistry at one point, but many of us forgot.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.720]   Maybe we didn't even understand it the first time around,
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.380]   which is that positives and negatives attract.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.540]   So when you have individual water molecules,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.900]   they have the opportunity to interact
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.260]   and essentially bind to one another
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.860]   and they bind through what are called covalent bonds.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.340]   Covalent bonds are relatively weak bonds.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.920]   And so as a consequence, water can change its conformation.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.660]   However, covalent bonds are strong enough
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.360]   that water actually can maintain some structure
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.500]   and that structure will vary, of course,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.960]   depending on its temperature.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.120]   So what you need to know about water is that indeed,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.340]   it consists of lots of individual H2Os
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.660]   and those H2Os can arrange themselves in different ways
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.460]   and that temperature is a strong determinant
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.860]   of the arrangement of those water molecules.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.660]   That is they're bonding to one another.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.180]   And in fact, even their spacing between those bonds.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.960]   So again, even if you don't have any chemistry,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.500]   stay with me because you'll definitely understand this.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.400]   Water can exist in at least three forms
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.660]   and maybe four forms.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.940]   We know that it can be liquid, of course.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.600]   That's really normally what we think of
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.820]   when we think of water.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.220]   It can be gas, so we think of steam, right?
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.240]   So if you heat it up, it takes on a,
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.540]   not a semi-solid or a semi-liquid form,
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.420]   it takes on this property of steam or gas, okay?
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.060]   So when you see steam or when you breathe on a cold day
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.080]   through your mouth or through your nose
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.740]   and you see your air,
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.740]   those are water molecules that are condensing,
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.660]   that is bonding in certain ways
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.540]   based on differences in temperature
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.740]   between the inside of your body and the outside air.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.380]   And of course it can be a solid, it can be ice.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.700]   Now, ice is fascinating and important in understanding
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.860]   how water works.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.020]   And this will become relevant later
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.660]   when we think about how water works within the body as well,
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.900]   especially how different temperatures of water
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.940]   impact the health and behavior of our cells.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.360]   And the most important point to understand
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.660]   about water in its solid state
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.140]   is that unlike most substances,
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.660]   when water is in its solid state,
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.940]   it is actually less dense than when it's in its liquid state.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.260]   So just think about that.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.580]   Most substances, most metals, for instance,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.500]   when they are in a solid state,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.260]   they are more dense than when they are in a liquid state.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.240]   So for instance, if they're in a solid state,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.740]   they will sink in a container
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.920]   filled with their liquid form, not water.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.820]   Water is very interesting because as you cool water
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.680]   and water transitions from a liquid to a solid,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.920]   it still binds, that is it can form bonds
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.640]   between those different molecules of water,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.400]   but the spacing between those H2Os,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.360]   so again, those peace symbols with hands,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.240]   so if you had a bunch of those,
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.160]   if you had 1,000 hands all making peace symbols,
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.540]   they can bond to one another, but when it's cold,
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.720]   those bonds are actually made
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.240]   further apart from one another.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.480]   And as a consequence, ice, as we all know,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.700]   floats in water.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.900]   In other words, put very simply,
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.800]   water is unusual and special in that in its solid form,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.820]   ice, it is actually less dense
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.480]   than when it's in its liquid form,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.400]   and that's why ice floats in water.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.320]   Now, this is important, not just to our biology,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.880]   but to all of life, because if you think about it,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.720]   if it were not the case that water is less dense
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.940]   in its solid form, ice, than it is in its liquid form,
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.640]   the bottoms of our oceans would be covered
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.760]   with thick sheets of ice, and if that were the case,
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.560]   you can be absolutely sure that life would not exist
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.960]   on our planet the way that it does,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.520]   and there's a good chance
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.300]   that we would not exist as a species,
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.680]   because so much of what allows us to exist on this planet
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.360]   and the other animals to exist on this planet
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.760]   relies on photosynthesis pathways in plants
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.080]   that are dependent on the sun and interactions
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.760]   with the oceans and lakes and other bodies of water.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.040]   And of course, the ice caps are vitally important,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.200]   that is the presence of ice, especially at the poles,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.960]   but elsewhere in bodies of water as well,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.880]   so called icebergs are a critical part of the ecosystem
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.540]   that allows for everything from photosynthesis
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.940]   to the ability of certain animals to extract food
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.480]   from each other and from their local resources.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.260]   Now, there's a whole discussion to be had there,
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.400]   but the important point for now
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.520]   is that the physical properties of the bonds between water
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.960]   that are made and changed depending on temperature
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   turn out to be essential for us to be present
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.340]   on this planet at all, and for our cells to function
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.160]   in the ways that they do for sake of health
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.840]   and for sake of disease.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.220]   And we'll explore this later
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.920]   when we talk about the critical relationship
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.280]   between temperature, pH,
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.360]   which is the relationship between alkalinity,
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.120]   how basic, or acidity, how acid a given liquid,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.240]   or in this case, we're going to be talking about water is,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.200]   and the ways that our cells can or can't use water.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.740]   So I realize that this is fairly in-depth
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.820]   for those of you that don't have
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.360]   much of a background in chemistry.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.740]   I've tried to keep it really top contour,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.760]   but if you can make a peace symbol,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   or if you can just imagine a peace symbol in your mind
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.980]   and realize that that's a water molecule
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.860]   and that those water molecules combine to one another
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.760]   through bonds that are relatively strong,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.900]   but weak enough that they can be broken if they need to,
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.500]   and that the temperature that those water molecules
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.160]   are exposed to changes the distance between those bonds,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.900]   and that's what allows ice to float in water,
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.500]   then you are going to have no problem
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.580]   with the remainder of the discussion today.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.200]   In fact, you will also have the ability
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.760]   to understand things that you've observed many times over,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.860]   but perhaps have never thought about or really understood,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.160]   which are, for instance,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.840]   that water has a certain level of surface tension.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.440]   For instance, if you've ever been to the ocean
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.820]   and the waves are coming in,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.860]   what you'll notice is if you walk on the dry sand
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.400]   or gravel, pebbles, that is, of the ocean,
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   it's very easy, right?
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.380]   I mean, the pebbles move down or the sand moves down.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.140]   It depresses a little bit due to the weight of your body.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.380]   But as you get closer to the water,
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.300]   you're going to sink deeper
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.820]   because that sand is more saturated with water.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.220]   But at some point, you won't be able
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.980]   to actually walk on top of the water, right?
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.760]   It has been said that Jesus walked on water.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.140]   There's the so-called Jesus Christ lizard,
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.660]   so named because it can actually walk
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.260]   on the surface of water.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.360]   A leaf can float on the surface of water.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.180]   Under some conditions,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.540]   a coin can float on the surface of water.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.260]   If you make coffee in the morning,
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.580]   you can actually take a spoonful of that hot coffee
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.260]   and pour a little bit on the surface of your coffee,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.740]   and you'll notice that it will bead up
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.460]   and you'll get little round spheres of water.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.500]   Those are little water molecules bound to one another
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   that spin on top of the surface before they sink under.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.140]   That has everything to do with the bonding between water
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.120]   that's dependent on temperature,
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   but also as with the difficulty for essentially everybody
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.040]   to walk on water or for animals to walk on water,
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.700]   the surface tension of water allows certain things
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.440]   to float there or to stay at the surface.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   But there's a very thin layer of water molecules
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.380]   at the surface of water that are more dense
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.020]   than the water that resides at deeper depths.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.700]   And that's why most things, including us, sink in water.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.340]   We are more dense than water.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.020]   Now, I did mention earlier
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.140]   that there are three forms of water.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.040]   Those are the ones that we all are familiar with,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.780]   the solid, liquid, and gas forms of water.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.860]   However, there are data mainly
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.480]   from Gerald Pollack's laboratory
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.300]   at the University of Washington
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.060]   that have described the so-called fourth phase of water,
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.420]   which is structured water.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.580]   And we'll get into this a little bit later
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.380]   because structured water has really been a prominent topic
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.500]   in the, let's call it the water health aficionados.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.340]   It's a heavily debated topic as to whether
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.040]   or not structured water is somehow better for ourselves
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.540]   if it exists within our bodies.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.140]   We'll get into that in full detail later.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.460]   But the whole notion of structured water is
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.080]   that in the presence of certain solids or certain liquids,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.620]   the confirmation of water,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.260]   that is the water molecules, actually change somewhat.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.400]   This has been demonstrated.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.380]   Whether or not it has relevance
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.860]   to the biological function of our body is a different issue.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.020]   But we know that there is this fourth phase
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.800]   of water called structured water.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.040]   Structured water is a fairly complicated topic,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.020]   but we can make it very simple
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.960]   for the sake of today's discussion.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   I mentioned earlier that opposite poles attract,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.780]   that is, positives and negatives attract,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.580]   and typically things that are negatively charged
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.140]   when presented with another negative charge either repel
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.660]   or don't attract, things that are positively charged
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.500]   in the presence of another positive charge
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.420]   also tend to repel.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.220]   This is the basis of magnets either sticking to one another
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.860]   or repelling from one another.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.340]   There's also the idea that human beings
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.260]   who are opposites attract,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.620]   but that's a different episode
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.660]   that we need to do in the future.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.240]   The point here is that structured water
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.440]   is a unique condition in which the local environment
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.140]   that these water molecules happen to be in
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.540]   allows positive charges between different water molecules
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.740]   to attract one another.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.980]   So again, whereas normally it's positive and negatives
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.240]   that attract, in the configuration
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.960]   that we call structured water,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.340]   positives and positives attract
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.720]   and form bonds that are stronger than the typical bonds
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.580]   that would be formed between water molecules.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.960]   And just as a kind of prelude to our discussion
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.980]   about structured water
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.860]   as it may or may not relate to health later,
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.620]   there are a number of people that believe
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.420]   that within the body,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.840]   because of the presence of certain liquids and solids,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.100]   that the water within our cells
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.020]   and in particular within the interactions
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.040]   with so-called organelles.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.700]   Organelles are things like mitochondria,
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.060]   the Golgi apparatus, they have fancy names.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.600]   These are the things within cells
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.860]   that allow cells to do everything from make proteins
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.940]   to traffic proteins out to the surface of cells,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.680]   things like neurotransmitters and receptors and so on.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.240]   A lot of people who are interested in structured water
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.940]   as it relates to biological function
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.060]   have hypothesized or like to debate rather
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.620]   whether or not in the body water is not just present
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.180]   in its liquid form or gaseous form.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.940]   We know it's not present in its solid form
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.320]   unless you gulp down some ice cubes, for instance.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.800]   But there is a cohort of people out there,
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.460]   including some fairly accomplished scientists
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.840]   that believe that within the body,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.280]   the organelles of our cells act as a substrate
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.340]   for water to exist in this fourth form,
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.020]   this structured water form.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.620]   And that's led to this whole niche industry
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.660]   of people who are proponents
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.580]   of consuming so-called structured water.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.140]   Again, we'll get to that a little bit later.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.700]   So now you know what individual water molecules consist of.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.640]   When you hear H2O,
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.300]   hopefully you'll get that visual image in your mind
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.860]   of an individual water molecule being the peace symbol
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.500]   and a bunch of those binding to one another
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.460]   through these relatively weak bonds,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.580]   but strong enough that certain things can take place
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.860]   like surface tension.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.060]   Keep in mind that surface tension of water may relate
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.320]   to either standard bonds between water or this fourth phase.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.520]   And that's heavily debated still,
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.980]   but we certainly know that, for instance,
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.700]   if you were to take a piece of wax paper or glass
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.660]   and you were to pour some water on it,
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.440]   you would notice that the water would bead up
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.380]   or kind of aggregate at particular locations.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.280]   When you see that beading up
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.180]   or the aggregation of water molecules
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.420]   on a particular surface, you're seeing two things.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.380]   This is actually kind of fun.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.360]   The next time you see it, you'll know that the aggregation,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.040]   the beading up of water with itself,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.660]   so individual water molecules or many water molecules
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.960]   kind of aggregating at one location
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.500]   and making a bead of water, that's due to these bonds,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.740]   these covalent bonds occurring between water molecules.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.200]   But also you'll notice that on a vertical pane of glass,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.160]   say in rain or on your windshield,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.220]   that the water will look almost like it's sticking
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.060]   to the glass.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.260]   And that's because there are actually bonds
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.580]   between the water molecules that have beaded up themselves
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.460]   and the glass.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.860]   So water can not just bind to itself,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.020]   it can also bind to certain surfaces.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.460]   And the fact that perhaps if you drive your car,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.140]   if you were to tap the window,
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.860]   or if a big enough bead of water formed on a window
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.820]   that it would start to drip down,
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.740]   and that's because those bonds with the surface are strong,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.560]   but they're not so strong that it stick at that location.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.140]   Quite different than water that is in its solid form,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.820]   ice, that can actually really adhere.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.780]   If you've ever had to scrape ice off a windshield,
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.000]   so for those of you who live in cold regions,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.840]   you're familiar with this,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.420]   have to scrape ice off a windshield,
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.180]   you realize that the bonds between water in its solid form
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.500]   and different surfaces is quite a bit stronger
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.180]   than the bonds between different water molecules
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.540]   with each other,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.660]   or the bonds between water and different surfaces
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.500]   when they are warmer.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.120]   So I do realize that for a lot of people listening,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.900]   that's going to be a pretty deep dive into the chemistry
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.660]   and physical properties of water.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.780]   But all you really need to know is that these water
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.340]   molecules are incredibly versatile and can bind
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.560]   to each other and can bind to different surfaces
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.660]   and can allow things to float or to sink
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.660]   or even to move across surfaces of water
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   based on the three, perhaps four different states
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.220]   that water can be in.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.460]   And that versatility that you observe in the natural world
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.380]   on window panes and rain and clouds and hail
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.140]   and ice and snow and scraping ice off your windshield
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.860]   in the cold of winter and perspiration and so on,
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.000]   all of that is fine and good,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.500]   but realize that almost all of those same sorts
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.000]   of properties of water become extremely relevant
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.160]   when thinking about how your body actually utilizes water.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.180]   And the key thing here is that temperature
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.400]   and the so-called alkalinity or acidity,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.540]   that is the pH of water,
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.640]   turn out to be very important determinants
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.260]   of how water is used by the cells of your body.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.900]   In fact, as I'll describe in a moment,
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   we have entire sets of biological mechanisms
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.020]   solely devoted to trying to get water into our cells
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.040]   in very specific ways, including at specific rates
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.060]   and to use water in different ways,
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.040]   because as you've probably heard before,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.560]   we are mostly water.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.940]   What's kind of interesting to me
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.660]   and what I found researching this episode
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.160]   is that the percentages of our cells and bodies
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.960]   that are purported to be water is a pretty broad range.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.600]   Some people will say we're 55% water.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.020]   Other people will say we're 70% water.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.880]   Some people say we're 95% water.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.080]   The exact percentage doesn't matter so much
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.500]   and really just boils down to whether or not
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   the person that's stating that percentage
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.340]   is talking about how much water is present
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.380]   in our cells and body at a given moment
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.220]   versus how much water was involved in the process
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.940]   of creating the sorts of proteins
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.500]   and other things of our body that are required
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   to have hair cells, skin cells, brain cells, et cetera.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.020]   So if you really want a number out there,
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.260]   I can't give you a single number.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.380]   If you want to be accurate, it's going to have to be a range.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.060]   And basically we are anywhere from 70% to 90% water
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.580]   depending on how you define being water.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.300]   That is whether or not you're talking about
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.860]   water being present in cells in its liquid form
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.860]   or maybe in this fourth structure water form
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.060]   if you're of the mind that that exists within us
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.900]   and whether or not you're talking about
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.920]   water that was used to create a given protein
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.900]   like a receptor or neurotransmitter
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.640]   or whether or not you're talking about the water
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.060]   just being water as H2O.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.500]   So again, it's very easy to go down that rabbit hole
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.940]   and this is part of the reason why
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.480]   there's such a wide discrepancy of assertions
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.620]   as to how much of us is water, but let's be direct.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.300]   Most of our body is water
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.080]   and there isn't a single other molecule in the universe
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   that we can look to and say that it has as important a role
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.140]   in our health and biology and frankly,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.340]   our presence of life on earth at all than water.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.860]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.780]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.220]   Athletic Greens now called AG1
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.600]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.500]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.180]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.400]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.980]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.060]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   once or usually twice a day
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.980]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.660]   that I need for gut health.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.820]   Our gut is very important.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.300]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.060]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.460]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.100]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.140]   and those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.800]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.380]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.780]   vitamins and minerals that make sure
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.740]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.620]   and it tastes great.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.060]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.460]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.420]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.740]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.320]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.740]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.420]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.800]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.820]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.260]   Okay, so now at a minimum,
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.660]   everyone out there should understand
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.580]   that water has a particular structure.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.340]   So when you hear H2O, you can kind of imagine that structure
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.560]   and that the water molecules can change their conformation.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.740]   That is, they can bind to other water molecules
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.340]   and it turns out they can bind to other things
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.020]   and actually change the conformation of other things.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:01.140]   A good example of that is something we're all familiar with
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.860]   which is water's ability to dissolve certain substances
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.920]   like sugar or salt.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.180]   And that is because salt molecules or sugar molecules
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.080]   are what we call hydrophilic, they like water.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.960]   And when we say they like water,
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.320]   it just means that the chemical structure of salt, sodium
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.160]   or the chemical structure of say sucrose like table sugar
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.660]   can actually interact with the hydrogens
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.660]   and oxygens of water and can change those salt molecules
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:37.160]   or sugar molecules, turning them from solid into liquid,
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.500]   essentially creating what are called solutes
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.740]   which is basically the dissolving of solids
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.260]   into a liquid solutions.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.260]   In fact, water is one of the best solvents on the planet.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.980]   In fact, water is better at dissolving many solids
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.660]   than is acid, right?
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.960]   That's how incredible water is.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.800]   And there are a number of reasons
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.360]   related to the chemistry of water that can explain that.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.560]   But as we transition from talking about the physics
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.540]   and chemistry of water to how water actually behaves
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.700]   within our body and contributes to our health
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.920]   or to disease, depending on the case,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.620]   it's important to understand that molecules
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.540]   such as sugar and salt can be hydrophilic
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.020]   or as we know, oil and water don't mix.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.180]   That's because oils, lipids are so-called hydrophobic.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.020]   What's hydrophobic?
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.480]   We'll just think, ah, phobic.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.140]   Certain molecules such as lipids
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.180]   don't dissolve well in water.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.680]   And we all intuitively understand that
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.180]   if you take some olive oil, for instance,
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.380]   and you put it into a little glass of water,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.300]   it'll likely float or bead up or form a little spherical
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.380]   or amoeba-like shapes within the water.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.760]   And that's because oil lipids are hydrophobic.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.260]   So different substances out there
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.340]   are either going to be more hydrophilic,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.140]   that is they are going to have a greater propensity
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.020]   to interact with water and bind with the different aspects
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.060]   of the water molecules or hydrophobic
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.940]   to have less of a propensity to interact with
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.380]   and bind with water molecules.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.540]   And I'm sort of been alluding to this numerous times
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.100]   throughout this podcast already,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.820]   the temperature of water and the pH,
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.660]   that is the alkalinity or acidity of water
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.620]   will have a strong impact on whether or not
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.540]   a hydrophilic or hydrophobic substance
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.260]   will have a greater or lesser tendency
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.700]   to interact with water.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.900]   You all know this intuitively as well.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.380]   If you've ever tried to dissolve, say,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.580]   a big tablespoon of sugar in very cold water,
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.700]   you'll notice that the grains don't dissolve as quickly
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.220]   as when you take that big tablespoon of sugar
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.440]   and put it into a warm or hot cup of water.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.800]   And that's because the temperature of water
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.100]   actually changes how well that sugar molecule
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.400]   is able to change its conformation
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   and interact with the water molecules.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.900]   Likewise, if you want to get something
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.000]   that's really hydrophilic into an aqueous,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.300]   that is a water containing solution,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.980]   the temperature is also going to strongly impact that.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.860]   Now, there are a near infinite number of examples
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.580]   of how temperature and pH impact the tendency
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.260]   of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.720]   to dissolve in water or not.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.200]   We're not going to go into all those details,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.640]   but as we migrate from our discussion
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.060]   about the physics and chemistry of water
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.620]   into how water behaves within our body,
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.900]   which is what we're going to do now,
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.140]   and then as we continue into the third part
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.980]   of our discussion, which is why and how certain types
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.160]   of water that some of you are familiar with,
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.180]   like different pH water, distilled water,
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.460]   reverse osmosis water,
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.900]   why those different types of water are thought to,
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.180]   and in some cases do in fact change the ways
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.520]   that our cells function for better or for worse,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.580]   all of that will come together and make sense for you.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.780]   Okay, so all the cells of your body, every cell,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.340]   even your bones, that is the osteoblasts
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.660]   and the other cells within your bones,
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.280]   your bone marrow, your red blood cells,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.820]   your white blood cells, your neurons, your nerve cells,
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.460]   your liver cells, your kidney cells,
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.580]   all of them require water.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.880]   In order to get the proper amount of water into those cells,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.500]   there are basically two ways
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.740]   that water can access those cells.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.500]   Now, if we zoom out for a second and ask ourselves,
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.600]   how does water actually get into the body?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.440]   Most of us just think,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.320]   oh, well, we drink that water into our body.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.020]   Of course, that's the main way.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.220]   We can also breathe water molecules into our body
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.200]   through humid air.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.960]   When you hydrate your cells,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.260]   that is when you're bringing water into your cells,
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.520]   that water needs to move from your gut
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.640]   and into the bloodstream
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.900]   and eventually into the individual cells,
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.620]   whatever cell type that may be.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.660]   And there are basically two ways
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.140]   that water can access those cells.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.360]   The first way has been known about for a very long time,
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.160]   and that is so-called diffusion.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.660]   Now, the outside of most cells
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.620]   is made up of fatty stuff, lipid.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.900]   So for instance, neurons, nerve cells have a lipid bilayer.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.740]   It's two layers of fat.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.740]   And you already know that fat, lipid, is very hydrophobic.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.320]   Now, that turns out to be not a problem,
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.960]   but a solution for how water
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.380]   can get across that lipid barrier.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.740]   Why?
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.580]   It is the fact that water can change its conformation
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.380]   and lipids can change their conformation just enough
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.120]   so that the bonds between water
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   and the bonds between those hydrophobic lipids can interact,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.000]   allowing the water molecule
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.740]   to basically pass through the lipid
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.140]   because it can bond very weakly,
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.160]   or in some cases, not at all,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.780]   but very weakly to those lipids
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.080]   and then be pushed through to the other side.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.500]   Really incredible if you think about it.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.100]   If there was too much of a hydrophobic relationship
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.840]   between the lipid and the water,
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.400]   the water would come up to the surface
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.420]   of that fatty outside of our cells
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.940]   and then would be repelled away from it
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.480]   or would just stay there right at the surface.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   And that would be no good
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.980]   because we actually need that water
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.080]   to diffuse across the cell membranes,
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.820]   where actually it's a double cell membrane,
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.880]   as I mentioned before, two layers.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.920]   So water and lipids of cells can interact
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.800]   with just enough affinity
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.600]   that the water molecule can diffuse
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.220]   across those cell membrane barriers.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.060]   But, and this is an important but,
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.820]   the diffusion of water molecules
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.700]   across those lipid barriers on the outsides of cells
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.840]   is a fairly slow process
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.380]   compared to the other way that water accesses cells.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.900]   And this other way that water accesses cells
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.440]   is really something that was just discovered
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.620]   about 10 years ago.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.380]   So this is a fairly recent discovery,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.420]   but it turns out to be a fundamental discovery,
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.660]   which is the presence of what are called aquaporin channels.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.740]   Aquaporin channels are basically portals
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.300]   through the membrane that allow water molecules
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.700]   to move very quickly across cell membranes
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.740]   at a rate of about 1 million H2Os,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.580]   1 million water molecules per second.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.680]   And the way that water molecules move across
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.540]   the cell membrane through those aquaporin channels
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.380]   is very interesting.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.780]   The inside of those channels,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.780]   and the way you think of these is they're literally tubes
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.720]   stuck through the membranes of cells.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.540]   The insides of those channels are very hydrophobic,
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.660]   allowing those water molecules to just jot really quickly,
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.740]   almost as if in your mind,
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.100]   you can just imagine as if it was lubricated for the water,
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.620]   although it's not really lubricated.
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.380]   The water molecules can move through in single file
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.880]   [whooshing]
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.660]   a million per second.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.240]   Now, why would you need two ways for water
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.940]   to get across cell membranes?
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.460]   One fairly slow through basic diffusion.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.920]   And again, diffusion folks is the movement of things
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.140]   from a gradient of higher concentration
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.620]   to lower concentration.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.300]   We just think about this as things tend to run downhill
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.700]   from higher concentration to lower concentration.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.100]   They try and create equilibrium across space.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.580]   So, you know, if you had a bunch of marbles
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.940]   on one side of a box,
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.060]   just imagine that these were water molecules.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.980]   Because of the charges between those hydrogens and oxygens,
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.960]   there's a tendency for those marbles to spread out
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.780]   and essentially take on a fairly even conformation.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.620]   That's basically just diffusion across a space.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.020]   Water molecules will also move from higher concentration
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.020]   to lower concentration across cell membranes.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.940]   And then you have these portals,
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.940]   these tubes or these channels as they're called,
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.700]   these aquaporin channels where water molecules
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.420]   can move very quickly.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:20.060]   Now, the reason why biology seems to have created
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.240]   these aquaporin channels,
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.600]   and again, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.640]   but the most logical explanation is that
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.660]   we have many tissues within our body
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.640]   that often need water very quickly
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.040]   or need to release water very quickly.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.580]   Let's think about a couple of these,
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.880]   and then let's look at what the actual distribution
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.920]   of aquaporin channels is throughout the body.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.040]   What is an area of your body that on occasion
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.080]   will need to move water very quickly out of it?
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.320]   You can use your imagination here,
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.080]   but I'll just tell you that for instance,
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.660]   your tear glands or tear ducts
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.780]   need to release tears very quickly.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.580]   So you need to take water that's stored in your body.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.920]   If there's an emotional experience,
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.340]   or if you look at a very bright light, for instance,
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.960]   or God forbid, if you get some sort of irritants in your eye,
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.260]   you're going to start to tear up.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.160]   And those tears are the release of fluid
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.840]   from those tear ducts.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.860]   And so it's going to be the very rapid release
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.120]   of water from those tear ducts
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.820]   through so-called aquaporin channels.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.180]   And in fact, aquaporin channels are heavily expressed.
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.180]   There are many of them in the cells
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.020]   of the so-called lacrimal glands that release tears.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:35.020]   In addition, we need to absorb water from the gut.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.400]   And the gut has a lining, endothelial lining,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.280]   and other cell lining, mucosal lining,
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.200]   and water needs often to move very quickly
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.520]   from our stomach into the rest of the body.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.240]   And one way that is accomplished
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.760]   is through aquaporin channels
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.200]   that are expressed all along your gut.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.020]   So the discovery of these aquaporin channels
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.920]   is really highly significant
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.880]   in terms of understanding the different ways
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.780]   that water can interact with and get into
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.600]   the cells of your body.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.460]   Now, there are aquaporin channels,
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.260]   not just in the lacrimal glands that allow for tearing
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.220]   or within the gut, but in many tissues within your body.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.040]   And they even have different distributions
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.420]   within those tissues.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.540]   In fact, as one looks at the expression
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.040]   of the different aquaporin channels,
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.620]   'cause it turns out there are different forms of them,
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.740]   across all the cells and tissues of the body,
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.620]   there's really no single tissue within the body
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.760]   except perhaps the bones of your body.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.040]   And perhaps the ligaments to some extent
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.220]   that don't have these aquaporin channels.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.060]   Some of you out there
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.540]   may have heard of the so-called fascia.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.020]   Fascia and sheath muscles,
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.080]   are unique kind of connective tissue
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.780]   that gives some pliability and yet some rigidity
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.200]   that allow for a lot of the physical abilities
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.540]   of your musculoskeletal system.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.440]   It's incredible tissue.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.400]   We'll do an entire episode about fascia at some point.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.440]   Fascinating, fascinating tissue.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.140]   Fascia even contain aquaporin channels.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.240]   So the role of aquaporin channels in fascia
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.580]   probably relates to our specific needs
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   to be able to use specific muscle groups
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.960]   in particular ways at particular times.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.260]   In other words, if you're sleeping,
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.560]   you're lying down or sitting,
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.740]   you're not using your musculoskeletal system
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.860]   as much as if you're running
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.580]   or performing some repetitive behavior.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.060]   It turns out that the aquaporin channels
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.460]   in certain tissues like the fascia can be used
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.140]   when we transition from low mobility states
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.180]   to high mobility states,
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.380]   allowing more perfusion or access of water
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.320]   into particular cells of the body when we need it.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.100]   So just fascinating, fascinating channels,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.340]   these aquaporin channels.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.160]   And again, only discovered fairly recently,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.560]   so we're still learning new things
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.940]   about our biology all the time.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:40.420]   Now, and a very important feature of the aquaporin channel
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.140]   is that the movement of water molecules
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.200]   across the cell membrane through those aquaporin channels
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.180]   is strongly dependent on the temperature of water
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.660]   and the pH of water.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.000]   This becomes especially important in our description
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.580]   and our deep dive into so-called alkaline water
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.900]   or higher pH water a little bit later.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.380]   But I'll just give you a little teaser for now,
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.660]   because I'm sure that a number of people
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.900]   are wondering about this.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.380]   If you go into the store or even a convenience store,
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.220]   you will see pH water.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.300]   Now, every water has a pH, right?
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.060]   Lower numbers mean more acidic,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.640]   higher numbers mean more alkaline or more basic.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.180]   You'll see pH water that is 7.4.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.540]   You'll see 7.8, you'll see 9.8.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.120]   You'll see a huge range of these things.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.960]   And there are many, many different claims
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.740]   about how the pH of water is important
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.860]   for regulating the pH of the body.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.180]   Here's the real story.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.560]   The pH of your body, that is the pH of the cells
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.260]   at different locations in your body,
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.320]   is strongly, strongly homeostatically regulated.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   What do I mean by that?
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.100]   It means it doesn't change that much,
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.380]   which means that you have
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.700]   very specific biological mechanisms that ensure
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.000]   the pH is maintained, for instance,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.340]   in the skin cells of your skin,
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.260]   in the retinal cells of your eye, in your brain cells.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.640]   Now, it is true that across the body,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.220]   different cells and tissues have fairly widely varying pH.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.260]   Now, it has been said that the pH of bodily tissues
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.620]   is generally between 7.2 and 7.4.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.700]   However, if you were to look at the pH of your gut,
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.060]   and keep in mind that your gut is not just your stomach,
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.580]   your gut is the entire pathway ranging from your throat
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.900]   all the way down to where you excrete things
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.460]   out of your body.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.960]   That entire pathway has different pH levels
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.140]   depending on where you are
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.060]   along the gut and intestinal pathway.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.040]   And in fact, having much lower, that is more acidic pH
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.840]   at certain locations along your gut pathway,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.540]   is what allows those gut microbiota,
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.900]   those little microorganisms of which you have trillions
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.540]   that are important for regulating everything
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.940]   from neurotransmitter production to hormone production
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.120]   that allow them to flourish and do well.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:01.820]   That said, except under conditions of hemorrhage
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.680]   or changes in blood volume that are of a dangerous level
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.840]   that can lead to seizure or even death,
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.660]   the pH of the rest of the cells of your body
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.780]   and also those gut cells doesn't change that much
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.460]   on a moment-to-moment basis.
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.120]   So if somebody tells you that you should drink alkaline water
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.960]   or alkalized water, as it's sometimes called,
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.860]   in order to keep your body more alkaline and less acidic,
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.800]   there is essentially no basis for that
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:34.900]   at a macroscopic level or even at a local level.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:39.500]   Now, what that does not mean is that the pH of the water
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.260]   that you drink is not important.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.940]   In fact, if the pH of the water that you drink is too low,
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.900]   that is, if the water that you consume is too acidic,
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.520]   it will not move as quickly from your gut
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.180]   into the other regions of your body
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.980]   and therefore the other cells of your body
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.780]   that require that water will not be able
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.760]   to access it as readily.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.280]   You've probably experienced this
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.100]   if you've consumed certain water
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.380]   and it feels like it's sloshing around in your stomach
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.060]   or it feels like it's just somehow staying there
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.380]   or you feel its presence more, not just as volume,
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.080]   but it's almost as if you can feel the little waves of water
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.220]   along the inside of your gut.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.000]   Now, sometimes that can relate to temperature,
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.580]   but oftentimes that can relate to the pH of that water.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.040]   And it turns out it is true that water that is more alkaline,
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   that is, pHs of 7.4 or higher can move more readily
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.740]   across the aquaporin channel.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.840]   And in terms of absorption of water
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.380]   from the endothelial lining and the other cell type lining
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.160]   of your gut into the rest of your body,
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.140]   it is true that higher pH water,
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.460]   provided that pH isn't too high,
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.760]   is going to be absorbed more quickly,
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.900]   which partially explains why some people have an affinity
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.340]   for this higher pH water.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.160]   Now, this is not to say that you need to consume
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.340]   high pH water in order to hydrate your body properly.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.740]   I want to be very clear about that.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.940]   However, if you are interested
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:08.180]   in what the value of elevated pH water is,
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:11.860]   it largely has to do with this accelerated absorption.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.380]   And as we'll talk about a little bit later,
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.460]   there is also growing evidence
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.820]   that it can adjust the function of certain cells
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.020]   that are within your immune system
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.880]   and thereby reduce certain inflammatory responses.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.640]   So I realize, as I'm saying this,
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.980]   some people out there are probably thinking,
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:30.100]   "Oh no, this guy's like a pH water proponent.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.400]   He's saying we have to drink alkaline water
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.220]   or buy very fancy water."
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.260]   Now, I want to be clear, that is not what I'm saying.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.700]   And I'm also not saying that you need
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.220]   to purchase very expensive water
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.460]   in order to derive the maximum benefits
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.500]   from the water that you drink.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.420]   It turns out there are a few things that you can do
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.780]   by way of temperature and by way of filtering water
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.020]   and a few other tricks that I'll tell you
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.820]   a little bit later that will allow you
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.620]   to increase the absorption rate of water in the gut,
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.120]   which turns out to be a very interesting,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.860]   but also potentially important thing to do
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.660]   for not just reducing inflammation,
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.540]   but also making sure that you're getting proper hydration
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.240]   of different cell types in your body,
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.040]   including rapid hydration of your brain cells,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.500]   which, as we'll also talk about in a few moments,
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.860]   can greatly enhance cognitive function.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.620]   Okay, so we've talked about how water can get into cells.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.340]   There are two ways, diffusion and movement
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.100]   through these aquaporin channels.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.000]   We've earmarked the discussion that the temperature
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.020]   and the pH of water, that is the conformation of water.
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.300]   And here, I really want to embed this in people's minds
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.620]   that when we talk about temperature of water
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.800]   and pH of water, we're really talking about the arrangement
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.740]   of those H2Os, those water molecules.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.200]   So keep that in mind.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.900]   We've covered how water can get into cells
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.180]   through those two different ways, diffusion
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.660]   and through the aquaporin channels.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.240]   What we haven't talked about is what happens to water
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.700]   once it's in cells.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.120]   And this is very simple to explain.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.740]   Once water is inside of cells,
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.180]   it's going to be incorporated
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.020]   into the different proteins and organelles.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.700]   Again, organelles are things like mitochondria,
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.780]   the nucleus of the cells,
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.920]   which is contained to the DNA and so forth,
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.300]   in different ways, depending on which proteins are there
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.700]   and how hydrophilic or hydrophobic those proteins are,
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.400]   or in some case, aren't.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:16.060]   That's an entire landscape of protein
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.300]   to water-specific interactions,
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.740]   none of which we need to go into in any specific detail now.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.060]   But the one thing that we do need to realize
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:25.900]   and keep in mind as we go forward
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.500]   is that many of the biological processes in our body
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.060]   that involve the movement of molecules such as water
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.700]   and interactions with proteins are going to involve
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.360]   the bonding or lack of bonding
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.740]   between water molecules and proteins.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.540]   And anytime we're talking about bonding
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.820]   of one thing to the next at the level of chemistry
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.040]   or biology for that matter,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.380]   'cause they're really the same thing,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.780]   we're talking about whether or not
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.900]   there are electrons present
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.180]   or whether or not there are charges that are opposite
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.180]   or the same and on and on.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.580]   If you've ever heard of so-called reactive oxygen species,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.640]   what are ROSs or reactive oxygen species,
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.820]   or so-called free radicals or antioxidants?
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.580]   All of that is really just describing the presence
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:18.180]   or absence of charges that are bound or unbound.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.420]   So for instance, if you hear about free radicals,
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.340]   sounds pretty wild, right?
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.940]   Free radicals, what are free radicals?
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.540]   Free radicals can damage cells.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.540]   They don't always damage cells,
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.120]   but they can damage cells
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.360]   because they are essentially free electrons.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.640]   They are a charge that's sitting out there,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.320]   not bound to anything,
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:41.140]   and therefore can interact with the molecular structure
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.440]   of certain proteins and change those structures
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.140]   by binding to them or interfering
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.800]   with the normal binding processes of those proteins
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.960]   to water or to other things.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.160]   And in that way, cause damage to those proteins
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.860]   and potentially damage to cells.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.200]   Now, fortunately, our cells have ways
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.440]   to deal with those free radicals,
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.140]   and those are called antioxidants.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.760]   Antioxidants are molecules
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.440]   that can arrive in different forms.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.520]   Sometimes we think of antioxidants as vitamins,
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.020]   but they are also present in other things as well,
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:15.960]   that essentially bind up those free radicals
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.640]   or repair the bonds between cells
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.180]   so that the proteins are no longer undergoing these,
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.900]   let's just call them bad confirmations
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.840]   that damage the functioning of our cells.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.880]   So there are many different theories of aging.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.700]   There are many different theories of disease,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:35.700]   but there is not a single disease either of brain or body
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:39.220]   that doesn't in some way involve the generation
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.640]   of what are called reactive oxygen species,
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.700]   these free radicals and the damaging of cells
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.320]   at the level of their individual organelles and so forth,
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.620]   nor is there a single disease of brain or body
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.640]   that has not been shown to benefit
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.520]   from having some antioxidant interference
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.440]   get in the way of that oxidative process.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   So I realize today is pretty thick with nomenclature.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.580]   For those of you that haven't already realized it,
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.980]   what you're learning here is organic chemistry.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.920]   So you can feel pretty good about the fact
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.940]   that if you can understand the water molecule
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.060]   and understand a little bit about what free electron is,
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.600]   which is basically a charge that's out there
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.900]   that can potentially do damage,
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.640]   and the interactions of things like reactive oxygen species
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.600]   and the ability of stable bonds to buffer against
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.960]   or repair certain damage to cells,
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.240]   as we're describing it here,
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.000]   well, then what you're essentially thinking about
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.980]   and what we're talking about is organic chemistry.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:35.520]   Now, since this is a discussion about chemistry
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.600]   as a service to try and understand
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.840]   the biological effects of water,
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.120]   keep in mind that water itself, believe it or not,
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.280]   can act as an antioxidant
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.560]   provided that it's bonding to things in the proper way,
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.280]   which requires that it get into cells
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.160]   in the proper amounts and rates,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   which requires that the temperature and pH of that water
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.160]   be correct, and provided that there's enough water there
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.600]   and that that water isn't bound to other things,
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.360]   it's not containing solids that are damaging
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.780]   and potentially that it's carrying some of the good things,
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.480]   such as sodium or that there's potassium present,
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.820]   again, the so-called electrolytes
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.160]   that allow cells to function well, okay?
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.120]   So that's a bit of a trench of information
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.700]   and I don't want people to get overwhelmed or confused.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.440]   What I'm trying to do here is paint a picture
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.180]   of the biology of water,
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.000]   understanding that when you ingest water, drinking it down,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.060]   or when you breathe water vapors in the steam room
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.440]   or on a humid day, that water is entering your system,
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.160]   it's accessing your cells through these two mechanisms,
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.400]   diffusion across cell membranes,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.940]   or movement through aquaporin channels,
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.880]   and then once inside those cells,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.940]   it's able to interact with and change the conformation
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.080]   of different proteins and accelerate or slow down
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.820]   different cellular reactions,
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.700]   everything from normal metabolism to blood pressure
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:57.820]   to damaged cells, depending on a number of different features
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.480]   of that water, as well as what the cells happen to be doing
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   at any given moment.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.440]   So with that in mind, I'd like to turn our attention
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.000]   to how water, depending on its temperature, its pH,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.160]   how much we drink or how little we drink,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.560]   when we drink that water, et cetera,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.080]   how that can impact the health, disease, and repair
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.760]   of different cells, tissues, and organs of our body.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.360]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.180]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.480]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.140]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.720]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.280]   to help you better understand your body
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.160]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.440]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.420]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.760]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.880]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.620]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.740]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.360]   is that most of the time, it does not come back
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.960]   with any information about what to do
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.200]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.080]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.520]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.960]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.120]   becomes very straightforward
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.060]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.100]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.840]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.980]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.000]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.740]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.240]   of Apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB,
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.400]   and their ultimate plan.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.040]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.800]   and therefore, there's extreme value
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.820]   to knowing your ApoB levels.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.200]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.940]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.280]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.640]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.760]   Let's talk about how much water,
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.840]   or more generally speaking, how much fluid each
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.120]   and all of us should drink each day,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.360]   and how much fluid to drink
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.640]   depending on our specific activities and environment.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.880]   Now, this is perhaps the most commonly asked question
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.240]   when the topic of water comes up.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.880]   How much water do I need to drink?
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.780]   The other thing that comes up is a question,
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.520]   which is, can't we just follow our natural thirst?
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.300]   That is, can't we just pay attention to when we're thirsty
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.600]   and then drink fluids?
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.140]   And then that leads to the other question,
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.160]   which is, does the color of our urine provide any indication
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.080]   as to whether or not we are under-hydrated,
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.800]   over-hydrated, or hydrating correctly?
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.720]   So let me answer each of these things one at a time.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.320]   And in the backdrop, I want to highlight the fact
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.400]   that there are many, many, if not dozens,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.660]   hundreds of studies pointing to the fact
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:32.400]   that when we are dehydrated,
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.000]   our brain doesn't function as well
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.200]   and our body doesn't function as well.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.180]   So what I'm attempting to do in that statement
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.860]   is throw a net around the enormous number of studies
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.520]   that have shown that even a slight state of dehydration,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.000]   even 2% dehydration can lead to a significant
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.740]   and meaningful impact that is a negative impact
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.320]   on our ability to, for instance,
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.400]   carry out endurance type behaviors.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   So our ability to run on a treadmill
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.280]   and stop at the point where we feel that we can't continue
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.140]   is going to be negatively impacted.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.880]   That is, we will be able to perform less work
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.520]   for less period of time
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   when we are even slightly dehydrated.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.580]   Likewise, our strength is reduced
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.120]   by even slight dehydration.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.680]   Likewise, our cognitive performance,
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.200]   including memory, focus, creative thinking,
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.000]   flexible thinking of different kinds
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.720]   are all significantly impaired
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.040]   when we are in states of dehydration.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.820]   Now that raises an additional question
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.720]   that deserves attention,
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.220]   which is how do we actually measure dehydration?
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.060]   Now you hear different things.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.120]   Like if you pinch the skin on the top of your hand
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.280]   and it takes more than three seconds
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.140]   to lay down again flat, then you're dehydrated.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.980]   You hear that.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.540]   You hear, okay, if you are to press on your fingernail
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.860]   and see a change in the color of the tissue
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.840]   just below your fingernail, which indeed does happen,
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.960]   and it does not go back to its original color
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.460]   within one to three seconds, then you're dehydrated.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.300]   You hear things like this.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.440]   If your ankles are swollen when you're wearing socks,
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.280]   you take off the socks
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.400]   and you can see the imprint of the socks on your lower limbs,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.240]   that means you're dehydrated.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.600]   You hear this kind of stuff
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.680]   and you should probably be wondering, is any of that true?
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.860]   To some extent, it is true,
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.520]   although it can vary quite a bit by how old you are,
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.040]   whether or not the skin on the top of your hand
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.560]   tends to be looser or not,
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.860]   depending on whether or not you're leaner or not.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.700]   So in other words,
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.640]   those are not absolutely objective measures of dehydration.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.120]   Now it is true that if normally
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.880]   you can pinch the skin on the top of your hand
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.880]   and it returns to its normal flattened position
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.540]   within about one to two or three seconds,
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.520]   and it does not do that within five or more seconds,
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.360]   there's a decent probability
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.480]   that you're a little bit dehydrated,
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.100]   that you need to ingest some fluid,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.320]   or that if you press down on your nail
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.760]   and you see the depression causes a transition
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.720]   from kind of a pink color to a white color,
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.880]   and then you release,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.100]   and it doesn't go back to its original pinkish color
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.080]   within a few seconds,
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.080]   well, then there's a chance that you're dehydrated.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.880]   But again, these are not perfect measures of dehydration.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.080]   You may be surprised to learn,
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.200]   and I was surprised to learn,
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   that most of the basis for these statements
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.980]   like even a 2% dehydration state
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.680]   can lead to significant reductions
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.560]   in cognitive or physical performance
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.080]   are based on not direct measures of hydration,
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.480]   but rather on measures of reductions in water intake,
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.260]   which is a different thing, right?
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.880]   It's saying that ordinarily
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.480]   a person of a given body weight
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.320]   needs X amount of fluid per day.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.340]   And when they get even just 2% less
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.680]   than that amount of fluid,
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.900]   then their cognitive and/or physical performance is impaired,
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:46.200]   rather than focusing on dehydration of tissues.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.720]   Now, that might seem like a subtle distinction,
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.340]   but it's actually a meaningful distinction
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.280]   when you think about it.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.520]   However, it's a meaningful distinction
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.240]   that we can leverage toward understanding
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.680]   how much water or fluid we need to drink each day.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.520]   Now, there, we can really point to some solid numbers
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.760]   that, believe it or not,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.720]   are fairly independent of body weight.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.400]   Now, I say independent of body weight,
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.540]   I'm referring to the amount of fluid
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:13.160]   that most healthy adults need at rest.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.160]   What do I mean by at rest?
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.880]   I mean when not exercising
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.600]   and when not in extremely hot environments.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.160]   So I'm leaving aside you desert ultramarathoners
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.560]   or people that are doing any kind of movement
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   or living in environments that are very, very hot.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.220]   Here, I'm mainly referring to people
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.140]   that live most of their daily life in indoor environments.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.700]   Could be air conditioned or not air conditioned,
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.900]   heated or not heated.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.120]   What we're trying to arrive at here
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.540]   are some numbers that can work across the board
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:44.500]   because, of course, there are an infinite number
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.400]   of different conditions
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.460]   that each and all of you are existing in.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.400]   So I'm not going to attempt to give you a body weight
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.780]   by activity, by environment, by humidity formula calculation.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.160]   In fact, no such calculation exists.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   However, there are formulas
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.600]   that can put you into very stable frameworks.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.420]   That is levels of water intake for periods of rest
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.740]   when you're not exercising
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.560]   and for when you are exercising
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.820]   that will ensure that you are hydrating
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.980]   with the one exception being if you are exercising
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.320]   or if you are living in very, very hot conditions
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.640]   and you're not heat adapted to those conditions.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.720]   So what are those numbers?
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.100]   In other words, what is the answer to the question
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.020]   of how much fluid do we need each day?
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.440]   And here I'm referring to fluid.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.700]   I'm not distinguishing between water,
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.020]   caffeinated beverages, soda, tea, and so on.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.520]   I'll discuss that in a moment.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:42.600]   We can reasonably say that for every hour that you are awake
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.580]   in the first 10 hours of your day, this is important,
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.780]   in the first 10 hours of your day,
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:53.780]   you should consume on average eight ounces of fluid.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.460]   Now, for those of you that are using the metric system,
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:00.900]   not ounces, eight ounces of fluid is approximately
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.420]   236 milliliters of water.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.700]   And for those of you that exist in the metric system
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.820]   and aren't used to thinking about ounces and vice versa,
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.060]   just thinking about a typical can of soda
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.860]   in the United States, it's 12 ounces.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.360]   In Europe, sometimes the cans of soda
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.600]   are a little bit smaller.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.460]   That's a whole discussion unto itself.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.020]   But eight ounces of fluid, that is 236,
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.620]   let's just say 240 milliliters
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.300]   'cause we don't need to be too precise here,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.300]   of fluid on average every hour
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.280]   for the first 10 hours of your day,
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.180]   which translates to an average of 80 ounces of fluid
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.220]   for the first 10 hours of your day,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:43.820]   or 2,360 milliliters of water.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.780]   In other words, approximately two liters of water
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.900]   plus a little bit more for the first 10 hours of your day.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.780]   Now, I want to be very clear that this does not mean
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.280]   that you need to ingest eight ounces
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.600]   or 236 milliliters of fluid on the hour every hour
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.780]   for the first 10 hours of your day.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.180]   I'm certainly not saying that.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.580]   And in fact, most people are going to find
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.500]   that they're going to ingest water in boluses,
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   that is they're going to have perhaps 16 ounces of water,
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.200]   500 milliliters of water at one portion of the day,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.620]   and then maybe a couple hours of later
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.540]   that they'll drink some more water or some more coffee
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.660]   or soda or some other beverage in another portion of the day.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.940]   I do think, however, it's important for most of us
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.360]   to take a step back and ask ourselves
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.500]   whether or not independent of any other activity
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.900]   or environmental conditions,
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.320]   whether or not we are in fact ingesting 80 ounces
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.020]   or basically 2.4 liters of water
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.620]   for that 10 hours of the day
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.220]   that spans from the time we wake up until 10 hours later.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.040]   Now, why am I setting this 10 hour framework?
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.020]   The reason I'm setting this 10 hour framework
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.620]   is that it turns out that your fluid requirements,
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.460]   even just at rest, are vastly different
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:03.020]   in the time from when you wake up until about 10 hours later
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.660]   as compared to the later evening and nighttime.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.740]   And here I'm referring to people
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.220]   that are not doing night shifts,
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.300]   but if you are requesting a number
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.700]   of how much fluid to drink,
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.000]   independent of our needs for fluid for exercise,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.880]   that's going to be eight ounces of fluid
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   or 240 milliliters of fluid on average for every hour
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.120]   from the time when we wake up until 10 hours later.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.800]   That's the simple formulation that should basically ensure
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.860]   that you're getting sufficient baseline hydration
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.760]   for the cells and tissues of your body.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.620]   Now, if you are engaging in exercise,
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.060]   whether or not it's endurance exercise
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.420]   or whether or not it's resistance training exercise,
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.300]   you are going to need additional fluids
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.060]   in order to maximize the effects of that exercise
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.140]   and to avoid dehydration.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.400]   And there too, we have some excellent numbers
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   that we can look to,
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.820]   excellent because they arrive from research.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.140]   And this is largely peeled from the episode
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.440]   that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.380]   professor of kinesiology at Cal State Fullerton.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.660]   We did a six episode series all about exercise,
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.280]   everything from strength training, hypertrophy, endurance,
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.700]   nutrition, supplementation, recovery,
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.300]   everything related to exercise.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.060]   You can find all of that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.880]   And one of the components of those episodes
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.720]   that was discussed,
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.140]   but that some of you may have not heard
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.580]   is that there is a simple formula
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.760]   for how much fluid to ingest on average.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.820]   Keep in mind, this is on average when you're exercising.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:29.020]   And I refer to this as the so-called Galpin equation.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.900]   The Galpin equation states
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.980]   that you should take your body weight in pounds,
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.100]   divide that by 30,
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.700]   and that will give you the number of ounces of fluid
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:43.700]   to ingest every 15 to 20 minutes on average while exercising.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.420]   Your body weight in pounds divided by 30
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.840]   equals the number of ounces of fluid to consume on average
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.160]   every 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.020]   When I say on average, what I mean is,
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.460]   it is not the case that you need to stop
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.440]   every 15 or 20 minutes and consume that volume of fluid.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.660]   You could sip it from moment to moment.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.220]   You could wait half an hour or an hour
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.700]   and then consume a larger bolus of fluid, a larger amount.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.060]   Although it is recommended for performance sake
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.940]   that you sip or consume beverages
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.400]   fairly consistently throughout your training,
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.180]   one's ability to do that is going to depend
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.000]   on a number of things like gastric emptying time,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.960]   whether or not the particular exercise you're doing,
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.860]   whether or not it's running or jumping
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.940]   is compatible with ingesting fluid on a regular basis
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.980]   or whether or not you need to do it
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.380]   at different intervals than every 15, 20 minutes,
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.900]   maybe it's every five minutes, maybe it's every half hour,
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.020]   you have to adjust for you.
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.580]   But if you were to take the hour of exercise
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.620]   or the half hour of exercise
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.580]   or the three hours of exercise
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.020]   and ask how much fluid to ingest,
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.560]   it's going to be that Galpin equation
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.900]   of body weight in pounds divided by 30
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.540]   equals the number of ounces for every 15 or 20 minutes.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.080]   And of course, I can already hear screaming from the back,
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.140]   what about for those of us who follow the metric system?
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.160]   And there, there's a simple translation
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.340]   of the Galpin equation,
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:06.900]   which is that you need approximately two milliliters of water
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.140]   per kilogram of body weight every 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:13.620]   Again, the Galpin equation converted into the metric system
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.540]   is going to be two milliliters of water
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:19.620]   per kilogram of body weight every 15 to 20 minutes on average.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:20.900]   I'm sure a number of you are asking
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.480]   whether or not hydration prior to exercise
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.140]   is also important, it absolutely is.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.220]   And if you follow the numbers that I talked about before,
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.100]   approximately eight ounces or 240 milliliters
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:37.000]   of fluid intake per hour in the first 10 hours of waking,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.860]   that should establish a good baseline of hydration
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.380]   heading into exercise,
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.780]   which then prompts the next question I often get,
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.180]   which is, is the amount of water that needs to be consumed
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.540]   according to the Galpin equation during exercise
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.480]   on top of or separate from that?
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.120]   That is, does it replace the amount of fluid
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.520]   that one needs at a basic level,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.460]   that eight ounces or 240 milliliters?
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.220]   And there, the answer sort of goes both ways.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.220]   I think if you're going to exercise,
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:08.520]   then obviously follow the Galpin equation in some way.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.980]   Again, you don't need to be ultra specific about this.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.780]   These are ballpark figures that will ensure hydration.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.380]   So we've set them a little bit higher,
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.200]   perhaps than needed to ensure more hydration
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.760]   rather than less.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.060]   But basically the short answer is,
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:23.680]   if you're exercising for about an hour,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.640]   most people are exercising for an hour or two,
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.580]   probably not more than that.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.160]   Most of my workouts are,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.700]   certainly the resistance training workouts
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.080]   last about an hour.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.480]   Well, then you can replace the eight ounces
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.420]   or the 240 milliliters of water
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.660]   that's required at baseline with what you consume
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.300]   according to the Galpin equation
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.180]   during that bout of exercise.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.620]   A common question is if you are exercising
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.620]   in a heated environment, indoor or outdoor,
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.840]   or you are somebody who tends to sweat a lot.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.680]   And by the way,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.700]   we can all get better at sweating by sweating more.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.100]   Sweat is an adaptation.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.420]   So if you sit in the sauna more,
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.860]   you're going to get better at sweating.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:58.540]   If you exercise more, especially if you wear more layers,
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.020]   or if you do it in hotter temperatures
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.100]   or more humid temperatures,
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.380]   you're going to get better at sweating over time.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.660]   And sweating is an adaptation that helps cool your body.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.180]   If you are sweating a lot or you're in heat,
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.520]   how much fluid should you ingest?
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.640]   In general, I think it's safe to say
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.020]   that you may want to increase the values
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.540]   on the Galpin equation by about 50 to 100%.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:22.140]   So either increase by 50% or double those numbers
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.500]   if you're in a very hot environment
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.620]   or sweating an awful lot.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.900]   If you are sitting in the sauna,
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.200]   I highly recommend consuming at least eight ounces
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.100]   and probably more like 16 ounces of fluid.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.180]   So that translates again to about 240 or about 480.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.460]   Let's just round up 500 milliliters of fluid
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.460]   for every 20 to 30 minutes that you are in a hot sauna.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.500]   And then of course people ask, well, how hot?
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.840]   And it, okay, that starts getting really detailed
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.380]   and we can't distinguish between dry saunas and wet saunas.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.020]   And again, too many variables,
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.740]   but I would double your fluid intake
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.380]   for that hot environment exercise
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.180]   or for that hot environment sauna sit.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.720]   Also, if you are feeling dehydrated, okay,
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.420]   what does feeling dehydrated mean?
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.120]   That actually has a definition
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.300]   that we can get into a little bit later,
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.980]   but what we're really talking about here
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:13.400]   is if you are feeling as if your throat is dry,
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.140]   you are quote unquote parched or you're very thirsty.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.700]   Well, then there's absolutely no problem
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.400]   with ingesting more fluids,
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.780]   so 16 ounces of fluid or 500 milliliters of fluid per hour
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.980]   while you're feeling parched.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.900]   My read of the literature is that thirst
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.300]   is a reasonable guide for when we tend to be dehydrated.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.320]   However, it is the case that our thirst
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.360]   doesn't really keep up with our body's level of dehydration.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.600]   And we know that based on some really nice studies
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.000]   that have explored the amount of fluid intake
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.780]   compared to the amount of urination,
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.900]   compared to the amount of physical output,
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.600]   compared to the environment that one happens to be in.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.820]   These are sort of older studies in the realm of physiology,
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.560]   but here's the basic rule of thumb
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.020]   that's going to work for most people.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.300]   If you are feeling parched, consume fluids.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.360]   Ideally, you consume fluids that don't contain caffeine
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.500]   or other diuretics, diuretics being substances
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.420]   that cause the release,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.820]   the urination of fluid from the body.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.180]   And/or if you are consuming caffeine either prior to
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.220]   or after bouts of exercise or even just at work,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:20.220]   or you work in a air conditioned or otherwise dry,
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.200]   cool or hot environment,
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.340]   that you try and include some sodium
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.980]   and ideally sodium, potassium, magnesium,
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:28.100]   the electrolytes in that beverage.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.380]   So it could be a little pinch of sea salt with some lemon
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.940]   to adjust the taste a little bit.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.020]   It could be an electrolyte drink of element
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:34.860]   or some other sort.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.580]   There are a lot of different types out there.
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:38.620]   For most people drinking pure water,
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.980]   and I realize that many people do
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.120]   just like the taste of pure water,
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.740]   chances are you're going to have enough electrolytes
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.040]   unless you're sweating quite a bit
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.760]   or you're exercising quite a lot.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.820]   And under conditions where you're consuming
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:52.340]   very few carbohydrates, you're going to excrete more fluid.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.540]   If you are ingesting caffeine,
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.860]   whether or not it's from tea or coffee,
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:00.060]   I highly recommend increasing your non-caffeine fluid intake
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.140]   about two to one for every volume of caffeine.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.400]   So in other words,
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.720]   if you have a six ounces or eight ounces of coffee,
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.500]   you're going to want 12 to 16 ounces of fluid,
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.040]   ideally fluid with electrolytes or a little pinch of salt
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.960]   in order to offset that dehydration.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.100]   Hopefully those will provide good rules of thumb
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.180]   for what people want to do
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.540]   when they're just moving about their day.
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.220]   Again, underscored by the fact
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.140]   that even slight levels of dehydration
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:27.060]   can really impair our cognitive and physical performance
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.360]   largely by creating fatigue,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.180]   but more often than not by creating brain fog.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.940]   I get so many questions about brain fog.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940]   Why do I have brain fog?
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.960]   Why do I have brain fog?
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.500]   There is a vast literature showing that quality hydration,
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.960]   meaning hydration that matches the demands of humidity
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.360]   and output as described in the equations
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.180]   that we went over a little bit before,
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.860]   really can enhance clarity of focus and overall energy.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.060]   And we'll talk about why that is,
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.260]   but I'll just allude to it a little bit here.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.020]   The reason why ingesting sufficient fluids
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.260]   can enhance our ability to focus
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.580]   and in fact can reduce brain fog
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.960]   and can increase physical vigor and output
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.780]   is not mysterious to us.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.220]   We know that there are two mechanisms
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.380]   by which fluid intake triggers elevated levels of alertness.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.120]   And it all has to do with the so-called sympathetic arm
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.660]   of the autonomic nervous system, which is a real mouthful,
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.900]   but basically the sympathetic arm
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.180]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.620]   as many of you heard me talk about before,
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:25.400]   is the aspect of your nervous system
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.240]   that makes you more alert.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.060]   It has nothing to do with emotional sympathy.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.300]   It has to do with a bunch of neurons
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.500]   in the middle of your spinal cord
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.060]   called the sympathetic chain ganglia
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.640]   and some other related neural networks in your body,
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.300]   as well as regions of your brain,
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.620]   like the locus coeruleus that release things
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.860]   like epinephrine and norepinephrine and make you more alert.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.980]   And in a kind of magnificent arrangement,
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.100]   or I think magnificent arrangement,
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.220]   when we have fluid in our gut
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.940]   and when our cells are well hydrated,
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.660]   and believe it or not,
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.580]   when our bladder contains fluid within it,
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.700]   there is an elevation in activity
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.840]   of the sympathetic nervous system by way of two pathways.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.040]   One is mechanical.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.640]   In fact, we have so-called stretch receptors
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   in our bladder and in our gut.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.220]   These stretch receptors have fancy names
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:14.020]   like TRP, trip channels as they're called, or piezo,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.900]   which are these stretch sensing channels.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.840]   This is the beautiful work of many laboratories,
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.120]   but in particular, David Julius and Ardham Petapuchen.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.200]   David Julius is at UC San Francisco.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.080]   Ardham is at the Scripps Institute.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.440]   They've discovered a bunch of channels in cells
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.580]   that sends things from cold
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.940]   to different mechanical pressure,
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.240]   including expansion of tissues, so-called mechanosensation.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.380]   And basically what it all boils down to
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.980]   is that when our bladder has some fluid in it,
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.840]   when our stomach has some fluid in it,
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.060]   and when our cells are sufficiently hydrated,
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.260]   they send information about the mechanical presence
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.540]   of that distension.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.820]   And here I'm not talking about being like overly full
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.580]   or full chock-a-block full of fluid
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.840]   or your bladder feeling really, really full.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.180]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.780]   But when we are sufficiently hydrated,
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.460]   there's a mechanical signature of that,
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.860]   which is the expansion of our tissues
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.340]   'cause it has more fluid in it.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.660]   And there are chemical signals as well,
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.140]   which is the movement of water
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.760]   across those aquaporin channels is actually understood
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.000]   at a biological level by our cells.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.740]   And sends information to the areas of the brain
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.260]   that are associated with so-called sympathetic arousal
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.460]   and makes us more alert.
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.340]   This is actually what wakes us up
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.940]   in the middle of the night.
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:31.020]   If we have consumed too much fluid prior to sleep
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.300]   and we need to urinate, we wake up.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:36.060]   This is a mechanism that is not adequately developed
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.540]   in babies and young children.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:41.420]   This is why babies, young children often will wet their bed.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.860]   And believe it or not, in both humans and in dogs,
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.740]   our ability to control urination voluntarily
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.980]   is something that we actually learn.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.540]   Babies just pee in their diaper.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:53.220]   Dogs just pee on the floor until they're housebroken
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.800]   or until a child learns to hold onto their urine
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.280]   until they go to the bathroom,
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.840]   in the bathroom or the particularly appropriate location,
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.860]   outdoors or otherwise.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.300]   The point is that hydration of the body
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.060]   is signaled to the brain.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.740]   When we have enough fluid in the tissues of our body,
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.060]   when we consumed enough fluid,
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.100]   even if it hasn't already arrived to the cells
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.480]   and tissues of our body,
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.420]   that is signaled to the brain in the form of alertness.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.920]   And that alertness is what translates
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.440]   to the enhanced cognitive abilities that we have
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.740]   when we are well hydrated.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.140]   It's also what translates to our enhanced physical abilities
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.760]   when we are challenged with physical tasks.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.140]   So when you look out on the landscape of all these studies
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.260]   that have shown impairments in physical
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.740]   or cognitive performance
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.780]   under conditions of even slight dehydration,
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.500]   that all makes sense because our cells need fluid
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.060]   and we need water, but it also prompts the question of,
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.600]   well, does being well hydrated
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.340]   actually make our brain and body function better
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.300]   in the context of physical and cognitive performance?
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.500]   And indeed the answer is yes.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.520]   Now, earlier we were talking about these equations
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.940]   that you can apply.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.380]   And here again, I really want to emphasize
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.120]   that these equations were not meant to be followed
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.820]   down to the decimal point.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:07.340]   They were really meant and are meant as crude
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:10.440]   but sufficient guides for you to make sure
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.140]   that you're getting enough hydration,
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:15.160]   depending on your levels of activity and at rest.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.900]   If you recall, when we talked about those equations,
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.620]   I said you need about eight ounces or 240 milliliters
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.640]   of fluid per hour for the first 10 hours of your day
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.540]   after waking.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.120]   Now, why did I say for the first 10 hours?
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.700]   Well, it turns out that the filtration of fluids
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.460]   from your body, which is accomplished, of course,
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.740]   by your kidneys and by way of your bladder
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:40.860]   and the excretion of fluid out urethra, so-called urination,
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:44.340]   is strongly, strongly circadian dependent,
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.940]   meaning the cells of your kidney
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.660]   and the cells even of your gut,
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.980]   in fact, all the cells of your body,
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.940]   but especially the cells of your kidney,
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:54.820]   which filter the fluid that comes into your body
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.460]   and that makes certain hormones like vasopressin,
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.780]   which is anti-diuretic hormone,
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.980]   all of that functioning of the kidney
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.940]   is under strong regulation
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.180]   by so-called circadian clock genes.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:07.820]   Circadian clock genes are genes that are expressed
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.180]   in every cell, but that in certain cells of the body,
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.900]   very strongly impact whether or not that organ,
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.540]   in this case, the kidney, is going to be activated,
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.300]   meaning functioning, at a very high level
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.660]   or at a reduced level.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.340]   And we can make all of this very simple
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:26.320]   by simply stating what's contained in this beautiful review
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.020]   that I'll provide a link to if you want to learn more
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.420]   called circadian rhythms in the kidney.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.340]   And basically what is known
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.220]   is that for the first 10 hours after waking,
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.840]   your kidney is filtering fluid within your body
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.420]   at a very rapid rate.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.660]   There are a number of different cell types that do that,
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.840]   but they are basically taking that fluid,
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.460]   pulling out any contaminants,
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.860]   using hormones such as anti-diuretic hormone, vasopressin,
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.240]   to adjust whether or not you're going to hold on to fluid
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.500]   or release more fluid from your body in the form of urine,
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.980]   depending on the salt concentration,
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:00.180]   depending on how much fluid you need, your work output,
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.080]   the conditions you're in, all of that.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.220]   However, at about 10 hours after waking,
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.560]   your kidney really starts to reduce
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.080]   its overall level of functioning.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.380]   Now that doesn't mean that your kidney cannot filter fluid
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.380]   11 or 12 or 16 hours after waking,
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.880]   but it becomes far less efficient at doing so.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.040]   And thank goodness it does
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.440]   because you do not want your kidney filtering fluid
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.080]   at the same rate at midnight,
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.880]   assuming you wake up at say seven or eight or 9 a.m.,
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.660]   that it was filtering fluid at 10 a.m.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:37.640]   In fact, we can say that if you want to reduce
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.180]   your nighttime waking in order to urinate,
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.920]   which is a common, common question and concern
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.760]   that many people have,
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.400]   how can I avoid waking up in the middle of the night
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.240]   to urinate?
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.460]   And there I say, it's perfectly normal to wake up once,
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.380]   maybe twice each night to urinate.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.920]   But if you want to reduce the number of times
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.780]   that you wake up in order to urinate across the night,
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.420]   maybe even make that number zero times,
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.460]   you will greatly benefit by doing three things.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:05.620]   First of all, make sure that you're hydrating sufficiently
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.260]   during the daytime per the equations
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.700]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.960]   That will ensure that you are not excessively thirsty
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.240]   in the evening and therefore consuming a lot more fluid.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.420]   Second, and related to that first point,
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.620]   is that you do want to reduce your fluid intake at night,
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:27.340]   provided you hydrated sufficiently throughout the day.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.060]   And believe it or not,
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:32.460]   the rate at which fluid moves from your gut
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.460]   and into the cells and tissues of your body,
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.180]   and then from your bladder into urine,
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:40.540]   is determined not just by the volume of fluid you ingest,
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.700]   but also the rate at which you ingest that fluid.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.380]   And you might be thinking, that's crazy.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.900]   That makes no sense at all, right?
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.680]   If I drink a ton of fluid slowly,
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.540]   doesn't it still mean that I'm going to urinate a ton?
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.780]   Yes and no.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.860]   It also stands to reason that you might ask,
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.500]   if I ingest very little fluid, but I do it very fast,
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.460]   is it going to be the case
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.260]   that I'm going to urinate it out very quickly?
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.660]   Well, yes and no.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:07.620]   The point is that the fluid filtration systems of your body
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.300]   that range from the gut to the bladder
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.900]   and include the kidney of course,
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.380]   depend not just on the volume,
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.580]   but on the rate of fluid that you ingest.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:19.700]   Because of those mechanosensors that we talked about earlier,
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.180]   if you gulp down a bunch of fluids,
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:24.340]   you are going to excrete those fluids more quickly
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:28.340]   than if you sip them slowly, excuse me, sip them slowly.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:29.680]   So here's what I recommend.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.900]   Throughout the day when you're trying
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:35.780]   to get your adequate yield of water or other beverages,
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.580]   feel free to gulp that fluid or sip it.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.380]   I'm a gulper, not a sipper,
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.240]   but many of you are going to be sippers, not gulpers.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.600]   Consume fluid at the rate that feels right to you,
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.260]   but feel comfortable gulping that fluid.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.220]   However, in the evening,
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.700]   if you are somebody who has challenges
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.020]   with waking up excessively in the middle of the night,
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.360]   reduce your fluid intake,
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.820]   provided you've hydrated properly throughout the day.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.980]   And I suggest consuming no more than five,
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.280]   maybe eight ounces of fluid
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.640]   between the time of 10 hours after waking
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.980]   and when you go to sleep.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.220]   Again, if you're very thirsty or you're under hydrated
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:14.080]   or it's very hot, feel free to ingest more fluid, please.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.180]   But most people will find
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.640]   that if they reduce their fluid intake
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.220]   to about five ounces or less of fluid
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.940]   in that later part of the day,
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.300]   after 10 hours of having woken up and before sleep,
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:28.580]   and they sip those beverages as opposed to gulping them,
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.100]   that they will have fewer bouts
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.280]   of waking up in the middle of the night
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.420]   to go to the restroom and ideally zero.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.140]   Let's talk about tap water.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.380]   And here I have to take a deep breath,
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.900]   not a deep gulp, but a deep breath
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.260]   because in researching tap water
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:48.220]   and what's contained in tap water in different regions,
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:50.580]   not just in the US, but around the world,
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.860]   I confess the picture is a pretty scary one.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.060]   I want to be clear, I'm not somebody
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:58.500]   who naturally orients towards fear or conspiracy theories.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.780]   However, in researching tap water for this episode,
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.700]   by way of looking at the peer-reviewed research,
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.740]   meta-analyses, reviews, specific research articles
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.540]   where specific hypotheses were tested,
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:14.940]   and in talking with experts in toxicology and so on,
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.020]   it's a pretty grim picture, frankly,
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:21.700]   when one looks at what's contained in most tap water
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.860]   and whether or not the compounds
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.200]   that are contained in tap water
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.540]   are present in sufficient concentrations
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.660]   to negatively impact our health.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:34.300]   And the bad news is that much, if not all tap water,
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.680]   believe it or not, much if not all tap water
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.300]   contains things that are bad for the biology of our cells.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.640]   There is a silver lining, however,
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.260]   and the silver lining is that very simple steps
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.780]   that are very inexpensive can be used
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:51.140]   to adjust that tap water to make it not just safe to drink,
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.020]   but that makes it perfectly fine to drink.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:55.540]   So that's the good news, and we'll get to that in a moment.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.020]   If you are somebody who is interested
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.900]   in whether or not tap water
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.780]   contains things like endocrine disruptors,
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.820]   hormone disruptors that can negatively impact
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.340]   reproductive health in males or females or both,
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.540]   there's a wonderful review,
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:10.080]   wonderful because it's so thorough,
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.300]   although the news isn't great,
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.340]   it's very thorough, which is great,
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.260]   which is entitled "Endocrine Disruptors in Water
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.880]   "and Their Effects on the Reproductive System."
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:20.500]   This is a review from 2020 that analyzes water
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.540]   from a bunch of different sources within the world
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:28.300]   and essentially focuses on a few key components.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.960]   First of all, it focuses on the concentration of minerals,
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.000]   that is magnesium and calcium within water.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.060]   Many people don't realize this, but so-called hard water,
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:36.940]   sounds terrible, right?
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:40.280]   But hard water is water that contains magnesium and calcium,
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.660]   which turns out to be a good thing.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:45.200]   Some water contains more magnesium and calcium.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.860]   Other water contains less.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:49.360]   They looked at the presence of magnesium and calcium
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.500]   because that is going to impact the pH of water.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.120]   In general, the higher concentrations of magnesium
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.300]   and calcium in water, the higher the pH,
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.460]   that is the more alkaline that water is,
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:02.100]   and the lower levels of magnesium and calcium,
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.260]   the more acidic or lower pH that water tends to be.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.260]   The other thing that this review addresses
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.260]   is the concentration of so-called DBPs,
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:16.120]   dog, bulldog, porcupines, DBPs,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.780]   which are disinfection byproducts contained in water.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.740]   So obviously local governments, the government,
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.760]   wants your drinking water to be clean.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.120]   They don't want contaminants in it.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   They don't want sewage in that water.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.460]   They don't want chemical contaminants
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.400]   that are going to make people immediately sick.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.800]   So they treat water, water treatment plants,
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.560]   treat water with disinfection products,
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.000]   and those disinfection products
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.600]   create things called disinfection byproducts.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.160]   And the presence of those DBPs
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   or disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact the pH
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.920]   of water by way of changing the concentrations
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.460]   of magnesium and calcium.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:54.680]   Put differently, I do believe that governments
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.800]   are trying to provide people with clean water,
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.800]   but in doing so, oftentimes we'll introduce things
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.320]   to that water that are not good for us.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.240]   Now it's very clear that DBPs can cause endocrine disruption
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.400]   in ways that are not good for reproductive health.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.560]   I did a very long, in fact, four and a half hour episode
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.360]   on fertility and vitality.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.880]   That was male and female fertility, by the way,
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.480]   and vitality that, again, you can find at hubermanlab.com
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.000]   that talks about all the biological processes involved
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.240]   in the generation of healthy eggs and sperm
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.780]   and creating healthy embryos,
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:29.000]   implantation of embryos and so forth.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.380]   It's very clear that DBPs have been shown
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.800]   to disrupt ovarian function, spermatogenesis,
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.320]   and fertility outcomes, even at concentrations of DBPs
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.200]   that are present in drinking water
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.080]   that comes from the tap.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.160]   Now, does that mean that you shouldn't drink tap water?
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.320]   Well, the answer to that is a, it depends.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.520]   What does it depend on?
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.640]   Well, it depends on several things.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.320]   First of all, I highly recommend that everybody go online
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.000]   and put in your zip code and ask for a water analysis
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.360]   of water that comes out of the tap in that zip code.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:04.980]   This is something that is readily available online,
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.960]   at least to my knowledge, and unfortunately,
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.660]   there's no specific one site that I can send everyone to
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.960]   to get an in-depth analysis of the drinking water
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.560]   that comes out of your tap.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:19.300]   However, I highly recommend that you go online
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:23.260]   and put in your zip code or municipal area code
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.380]   and figure out whether or not your water contains
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.200]   X amount of DBPs or Y amount of DBPs.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.000]   Now, of course, you're going to get a bunch of values back
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.540]   and unless you're a toxicologist,
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.540]   probably not going to know what those values mean,
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.820]   but what you're really looking for is whether or not
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.520]   there are high, low, or moderate levels of fluoride
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.480]   in that drinking water.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.520]   Why do I say that?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.040]   Well, there are studies that show that the concentration
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.320]   of fluoride in drinking water is of particular concern
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.400]   for the thyroid hormone system of the body.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.240]   Now, thyroid hormone has a lot of different roles
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.460]   in brain and body, and thyroid hormone is very important
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:05.780]   for everything from metabolism to levels of energy,
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.300]   when thyroid levels are disrupted
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.340]   or if thyroid receptors are disrupted,
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.780]   it can lead to depression.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.520]   When thyroid hormones are optimized,
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.700]   it can lead to optimal mood if there is such a thing,
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.120]   but in other words, it helps keep your mood elevated.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.300]   It relates to everything from sleep to reproduction.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.180]   Thyroid hormone is involved in many, many things,
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.040]   including bone health and tissue health generally.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.760]   So essentially every biological process in your body
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.760]   is impacted by thyroid hormone.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.160]   And there's a study that I'd like to highlight,
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.740]   which was published in 2018,
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.020]   and the title of the study is "Impact of Drinking Water
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.000]   Fluoride on Human Thyroid Hormones."
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.400]   This was a case control study,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.100]   so this is not an extensive analysis of many individuals.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.380]   However, what it shows is that fluoride
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.120]   negatively impacts thyroid stimulating hormone
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.640]   and so-called T3 levels.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.220]   So you have thyroid hormone T3 and T4,
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:57.140]   even in the standard concentrations that are present of,
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.060]   and here's an important number,
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:01.420]   0.5 milligrams per liter, okay?
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.180]   So if you can get ahold of the fluoride concentrations
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.940]   in your tap water and find out whether or not
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.700]   the concentrations are at, below,
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.500]   or exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter,
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.340]   what you will find is that even just 0.5 milligrams
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.060]   per liter of water can disrupt thyroid function.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.900]   And this is going to be a particular concern
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.700]   for people to have familial,
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.540]   so genetically related thyroid issues,
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.380]   or that are concerned with keeping
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.420]   your thyroid hormone levels healthy,
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:32.780]   which I think is everybody.
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.140]   So I am telling you that you should try
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.880]   and get ahold of some data about the water
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.340]   that comes out of your tap if you intend
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.660]   on drinking tap water, and probably even if you don't,
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:40.900]   just know what's in your drinking water.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.340]   Your local government should provide that information
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.340]   and/or it should be readily available online.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:48.200]   And in particular, I think it's worthwhile
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.500]   to address how much fluoride is present
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.140]   in your drinking water.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:55.220]   Again, I don't want to create a lot of scare.
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.260]   I'm not trying to trigger fear here.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:00.860]   I do think, however, by way of reading this review,
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.660]   by way of reading the paper that I just referred
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.060]   to a moment ago, again, links to these are going
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.200]   to be provided in the show note captions,
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.120]   that there is extensive evidence that elevated levels
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.860]   of fluoride in drinking water are simply not good for us.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.060]   Now, that could open a whole discussion
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.820]   of why fluoride is in our drinking water
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:20.060]   in the first place at all, but leaving that aside,
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.620]   it seems to me that most everybody should know
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:24.900]   how much fluoride is in their drinking water.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.660]   And ideally, everybody, yes, everybody,
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:30.660]   is filtering their drinking water.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.520]   Now, that raises the question
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.560]   of how best to filter drinking water.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.620]   And that brings an answer of,
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.580]   it depends on a couple of things.
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.900]   First of all, how healthy or unhealthy
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.600]   do you know yourself to be?
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.780]   So if you're somebody who has no health issues,
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.780]   you have plenty of vigor, you're sleeping well at night,
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.660]   you have no autoimmune disease,
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.940]   you're not aware of any health concern, minor or major,
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:53.500]   well then perhaps you're somebody
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.100]   that doesn't want to filter your water.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:59.580]   I would argue that why wouldn't you employ some very low
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.380]   or even zero-cost approach to filtering your water?
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.740]   There are going to be other individuals
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.980]   who are suffering particular ailments of brain or body,
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.800]   or both, that absolutely should be filtering
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.460]   their drinking water if they're getting
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.260]   their drinking water from their tap,
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.520]   because it is pretty well established now
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.300]   that tap water contains a lot
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.100]   of these disinfectant byproducts,
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.340]   as well as in most cases, exceeding the threshold of fluoride
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.060]   that we know to be healthy for us.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.180]   How should you filter your tap water?
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.260]   Well, you have everything ranging
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.460]   from the so-called Brita-type filters,
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.980]   so these are going to be carbon-type filters
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.060]   or other filters that you essentially put over a container
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.780]   or a compartment where you can pour the water over it
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.440]   and it goes into the compartment below.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.860]   Will those work?
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.820]   Are they sufficient to filter out
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.820]   the disinfectant byproducts?
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.380]   The general answer is yes,
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.580]   provided you change the filters often enough.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.360]   However, it is not thought, unfortunately not thought,
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.020]   that they filter out sufficient fluoride.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.940]   So what I highly recommend is, depending on your budget,
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:04.860]   that you go online and you search for at-home water filters
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.520]   that can filter out fluoride.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:07.660]   There are a number of straightforward
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:09.660]   and inexpensive tools to do that.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.160]   And here, I don't have any relationship
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.080]   to any of the water filters
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.460]   or things that I'm going to mention now.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.420]   I want to be very clear about that.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.140]   There's no brand code or affiliation here.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.500]   I'm simply trying to direct you to resources
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.980]   that will allow you to filter your tap water
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.220]   for it to be more safe for you to consume
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:28.080]   in a way that meets your budget with the understanding
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.940]   that people have very different disposable incomes.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.380]   So the range of costs here is going to be pretty tremendous.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   I just want to get that out of the way first.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.460]   There are water filters that you can use repeatedly.
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.100]   So these are what I'll refer to as pitcher filters
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.260]   that are less than $100.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.360]   Now, keep in mind that that's a one-time purchase
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.700]   except for the replacement of the filters,
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.940]   which fortunately doesn't have to be done too often.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:52.220]   So there are different filters.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.060]   I'll provide a link to one that I found
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:56.780]   that is at least by my read of the lowest possible cost.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.360]   So this is the so-called clearly filtered water pitcher
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.960]   with affinity filtration.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.020]   So this is a filter that can adequately remove fluoride,
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:07.340]   lead, BPAs, glyphosate, hormones,
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.840]   and some of the other harmful things
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.620]   that are contained in most tap water.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.680]   Again, I do realize that for some people,
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.840]   even an 80 US dollar cost is going to be prohibitive,
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.460]   but do realize that what you're doing here
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.180]   is you're purchasing a unit
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:23.700]   that can be used repeatedly over and over.
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.380]   The reason why it's lower cost
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.420]   than some of the different filtration approaches
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.380]   that I'll talk about in a moment
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:31.700]   are that you can't really put all the drinking water
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.260]   that you would use say for an entire week
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.340]   or for an entire month in one pitcher.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:37.900]   You're going to have to repeatedly pour water
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:41.500]   into the pitcher in order to filter it.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.740]   Now, as I mentioned before,
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:45.140]   the range on water filter costs for filters
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.780]   that can adequately remove fluoride
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.740]   and all the other things that you want
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:49.780]   out of your tap water is immense.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.360]   In fact, you can find whole house water filters
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.100]   that are $2,000 or more.
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.140]   Again, these are going to be filters
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.260]   that are going to be in your garage
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.940]   or in a laundry room that are going to basically pull
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:03.420]   from the piping system of your house
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:06.240]   and deliver purified water.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.400]   Technically it's not purified,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.200]   but that's removing these contaminants and fluoride
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.420]   from all the sinks in your house
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:12.340]   so you can effectively drink
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:14.060]   from any or all things in your house.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.580]   That's what explains the higher cost.
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.100]   I think most people are probably not going
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:19.340]   to have the disposable income
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.940]   or have the opportunity to include
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.000]   one of these whole house filters.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.120]   Although if you do have the means
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.620]   and it's important to you, you could do that.
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.660]   And then there are going to be
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:29.140]   what I would call intermediate systems.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:34.140]   So systems that cost somewhere between 200 and $500.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:36.100]   Probably one of the more common ones
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.540]   or popular ones is a so-called Berkey filter system.
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:40.860]   These are filter systems that again,
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.260]   remove the things that you want removed from your tap water
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.780]   and they can do it at higher volumes
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:47.380]   and they're typically countertop units.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.800]   They don't require any plug-in typically,
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.460]   or they only require brief plug-in and electricity.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.580]   And they're going to filter out many, many liters
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:56.700]   or tens of liters of water
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.280]   so that you can always have access
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.060]   to that clean filtered water at any time or day or night
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:03.160]   without having to pour over into the pitcher.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.660]   So I mentioned these different options because again,
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.000]   I realized that people have different levels
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.600]   of disposable income.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:13.600]   As far as I know, there's no tablet or simple mechanism
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.300]   that can be purchased as a transportable pill
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.780]   that you can just simply throw in water
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:20.920]   and remove the contaminants.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.420]   If anyone is aware of one that can adequately remove fluoride
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.340]   and other contaminants,
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.980]   please put in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:29.520]   That'd be the best place
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.300]   so that I and everyone else can see it.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:32.140]   But hopefully the mention
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.140]   of the different filtration systems that I mentioned
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:37.900]   will give you some choices that I would hope would fall
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.540]   within the range that one could potentially afford.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:43.020]   An important note about filtration.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.620]   Just as in our body,
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:48.120]   there are mechanisms to signal mechanical changes
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.420]   and chemical changes that occur in our gut,
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.720]   in our brain, et cetera, elsewhere.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.580]   And in general, both mechanical and chemical changes
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.640]   are signaled across the body to invoke different changes,
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.980]   whether or not those are a response of the immune system
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:03.580]   or to make us more alert or more asleep, et cetera.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.180]   So too filtration capitalizes
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.440]   on mechanical and chemical filtration.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.900]   What I mean by that is when you run a fluid,
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:14.740]   water or any other fluid through a filter,
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.700]   those filters are doing two things.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.300]   They are physically constraining
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:23.300]   which molecules can go through by creating portals, pores,
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.740]   that allow certain size molecules to go through
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.680]   and not others.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.260]   And almost always they contain
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.540]   certain chemicals themselves, right?
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.280]   Those filters have been treated with certain chemicals
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.700]   that neutralize certain other chemicals, okay?
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.940]   So you may be wondering how when you filter water,
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.420]   magnesium and calcium could get through,
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.540]   but fluoride doesn't.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:44.640]   And that's because these filters
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.700]   have been very cleverly designed
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:49.060]   in order to neutralize fluoride
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:53.520]   or to prevent large molecules such as sediment and dirt,
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.460]   which is kind of easy to imagine being filtered,
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:59.560]   but also to allow certain small molecules like calcium,
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:02.040]   which is smallish or magnesium, which is smallish,
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.400]   to still pass through into our drinking water.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.800]   And this is wonderful because what it means
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.880]   is that by filtering our water using any of the methods
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.160]   that we talked about before,
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.840]   you're still going to get whatever magnesium and calcium
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.720]   was present in that water while still adequately removing
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.420]   the fluoride and other disinfectant byproducts.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.460]   Now, what if you can't afford any of those options?
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.740]   Okay, well, here you have an interesting zero cost option.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:26.400]   It's not as good as the other ones of filtering that water,
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.100]   but it is an option.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.680]   And I do think it's important to give options
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.700]   to people who don't have any disposable income
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.960]   for the purpose of filtering their water,
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.660]   which is to draw a gallon or five gallons
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.560]   or maybe even more tap water out of the tap
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.520]   and put it into some container, some vessel.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.840]   So it could be one gallon, five gallon,
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.160]   10 gallon container.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.720]   And then to let that tap water sit for some period of time
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.320]   to allow some of the sediment to drop to the bottom.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.760]   Now you might say, well, there's no sediment.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.900]   There's nothing contained in that tap water
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.360]   and isn't fluoride diluted in the water?
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.780]   And indeed the answer to that is yes.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.080]   However, there is some evidence that letting tap water sit
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.560]   out at room temperature and outside the pipes
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.060]   that deliver that water can help remove some,
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.320]   not all of the contaminants in that water.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.860]   If, however, you are filtering the water
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.960]   using any of the methods that I talked about
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.000]   a few moments ago, you do not need to do this, okay?
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.920]   I realize there's a whole world out there
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.000]   of people who insist on putting their water in the sun
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.960]   or only keeping it in certain containers
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.300]   and putting it out for a few days before they ingest it.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.680]   That to me seems a bit extreme.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.240]   If you want to do that, be my guest,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.680]   but I don't think most people need to do that.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.560]   However, I do believe that for people
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:38.080]   who have zero disposable income to devote
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.360]   to paying for any kind of filtration system
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.620]   for their tap water, they're taking that tap water
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:45.460]   and putting it into some container at room temperature
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:47.940]   and keeping it at room temperature for a half day
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:52.940]   or a day or more, and then pouring off the top two thirds
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.280]   of that water into another container
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.300]   and consuming the water from that second container
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:01.000]   is going to remove some, not all of the contaminants
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.620]   that one would need to be concerned about.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.380]   And here I should mention something that I neglected
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.680]   to mention a few moments ago.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.360]   If you were going to do this zero cost option
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.860]   and let the water sit out for a bit,
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.520]   you would want that water to sit uncapped.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.460]   Sorry, I should have mentioned that before, uncapped.
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:17.800]   Of course, trying to keep things
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.960]   from falling into that water.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.720]   In fact, you could even put a little bit of cloth above it.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.340]   So you don't want things falling into that water,
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:26.920]   but you want certain things to be able to evaporate off.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:29.120]   And you also want some of the sediment to drop down.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.260]   And the reason why this process of letting water sit out
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:36.620]   would work at all is because many of the contaminants
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.200]   contained within water are not present
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.240]   because of the source of that water
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.920]   or even the treatment of that water,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.960]   but rather because of the pipes that that water arrives
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.160]   to your glass or the pot that you have from.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:50.300]   Okay, and here again,
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.620]   there's an infinite number of variables.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.960]   So some people are living in buildings
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960]   for which the pipes are very, very old,
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.600]   but very, very clean, believe it or not.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.400]   Some people are living in newer buildings and structures
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.600]   that have new pipes,
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.160]   but for which the seals between those pipes
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.960]   contain things that are not good for you to consume.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.360]   So by letting water sit out for a while,
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.420]   you're able to remove some of the contaminants
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.640]   present within the pipes of your home and the building,
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.320]   and even the pipes that lead to your home or apartment.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.120]   Now, some people get really obsessed
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.200]   with this whole tap water thing,
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.160]   and really want to find out all the details about the pipes
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:28.360]   and what sorts of hard metals and how much magnesium
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.440]   and how much calcium are present in their water.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.200]   There are ways that you can test your drinking water
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.240]   for those sorts of things.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.000]   Most people I realize, including myself,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.120]   are simply not going to do that.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.900]   If you want to know what I do,
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.020]   I tend to drink water that is filtered
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:43.080]   through one of these lower cost filters,
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.280]   or if I'm going to be consuming a lot of fluid,
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.520]   I will drink certain kinds of fluid
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.360]   that later I'll tell you I've been doing an experiment
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.600]   for sake of this episode,
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.680]   looking at so-called molecular hydrogen water,
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.680]   which sounds very fancy and esoteric
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.660]   and almost a little wacky,
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.500]   but it turns out it has largely to do
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:00.880]   with the amount of magnesium and calcium
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.200]   and the pH of that water.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.180]   So if you are somebody who has a very low budget
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.960]   or simply just wants to spend a very small amount of money
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.680]   and try and still drink tap water,
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.000]   there is absolutely a way to do that safely,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.500]   but it does require a few of these steps.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.120]   So on the topic of magnesium and calcium,
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:18.560]   this relates, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.280]   to the "hardness of water."
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.760]   So what of the hardness of water?
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.260]   Is it better to have more magnesium
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.960]   and calcium in your water or less?
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:30.420]   Some people don't like the taste of hard water.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:32.200]   They prefer the taste of water
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.520]   that has less magnesium and calcium.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.920]   However, there I would encourage you
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:39.280]   to take a step back and consider some of the literature.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.640]   In fact, I'll mention a paper
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.880]   in particular now published in 2019,
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.220]   which describes the, quote,
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.920]   "Regulations for calcium, magnesium,
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.220]   "or hardness in drinking water
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.320]   "in the European Union member states."
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.800]   Turns out in Europe, they do very detailed water analysis,
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.920]   and that's present in a number
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:56.760]   of really high-quality scientific publications.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.020]   This was a paper published
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.680]   in "Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,"
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:03.120]   and they cite a number of different references
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:04.700]   in the introduction that, for instance,
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.780]   and here I'm quoting, "Statistically significant
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:10.020]   "inverse association between magnesium
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:11.800]   "and cardiovascular mortality."
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:13.780]   Now, again, that's an association.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:17.120]   This is not causal, but higher magnesium in water,
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.920]   lower cardiovascular mortality.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.540]   They go on to say, "The highest exposure category,"
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.160]   which are people consuming drinking water
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.560]   with magnesium contents of 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter,
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.320]   again, when you get your water analysis,
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.420]   you can compare against some of these values,
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:35.880]   "was significantly associated with decreased likelihood
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.240]   "of cardiovascular mortality by 25%
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.720]   "compared with people consuming magnesium content
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:46.280]   "of 2.5 to 8.2 milligrams per liter."
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:48.320]   Okay, so what this basically shows,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   and by the way, the reference to that,
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.640]   I'll also provide a link to in the show note caption.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.800]   What this basically states is that
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.280]   higher magnesium-containing water,
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.600]   and it turns out higher magnesium
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   and calcium-containing water, so-called harder water,
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.120]   may not taste as good to you,
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.740]   but turns out to be better for you.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.820]   Now, whether or not it can prevent you
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.240]   from getting cardiovascular disease, I don't know.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:11.020]   In fact, I would probably just state no.
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.640]   It probably won't prevent you from cardiovascular disease.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.020]   You still need to do all the other things
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.360]   that are important for avoiding cardiovascular disease
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.760]   and cerebrovascular disease.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.220]   For that and what to do
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.860]   in order to avoid cardiovascular disease,
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.020]   I strongly encourage you to listen to the episode
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.440]   with Dr. Peter Attia that's coming out in a few weeks
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:31.000]   that gets deep into that topic and the actionable items
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.500]   for avoiding cardiovascular disease.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:36.640]   But basically, as this study quotes,
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.800]   there is a growing consensus among epidemiologists
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.280]   and epidemiological evidence,
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   along with clinical and nutritional evidence,
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.000]   that's strong enough to suggest
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.640]   that new guidance should be issued
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.820]   in terms of how these different sources of tap water
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.720]   should enhance, not deplete,
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.600]   the amount of magnesium and calcium in that water.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.680]   Now, this ought to raise a very important question
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:58.760]   in all of your minds, which is,
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.380]   why is it that magnesium and calcium concentrations
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.480]   are relevant to cardiovascular disease?
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.120]   Is it something about what magnesium does in cells
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.400]   or what calcium does in cells?
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.560]   Are we all magnesium and calcium deficient?
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.560]   Well, it turns out that's not the case.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:16.560]   The major effect by which magnesium and calcium in water
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:19.760]   are likely to impact things like blood pressure,
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.800]   cardiovascular disease,
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.740]   and other aspects of cellular function
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:26.120]   turn out to be somewhat cryptic,
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.220]   but we can make that cryptic aspect very clear
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:32.740]   by saying that when we have more magnesium in particular,
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:36.760]   but also calcium present in our water, so-called hard water,
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.520]   you increase the amount of hydrogen in that water,
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.560]   it becomes what we call hydrogen rich,
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.480]   and the pH of that water is increased.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.760]   Now, again, this does not mean
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:49.920]   that we are trying to change the pH of the cells of our body
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.240]   in any kind of meaningful way.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.460]   In fact, we don't want to do that.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.700]   We want the pH of the cells of our body
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:57.460]   to stay in particular ranges, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.480]   but having more magnesium and more calcium in our water,
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.240]   that is increasing the hardness of our water,
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.740]   changes the pH of that water,
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:08.120]   and it turns out that the elevated pH of water,
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:11.520]   that is pH of water that tends to be
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.040]   somewhere between high sevens, so we could say 7.9
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.160]   up to even nine or 9.2,
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:22.500]   is going to be more readily absorbed
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:25.240]   and is going to more favorably impact
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.600]   the function of our cells than lower pH water.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:29.840]   Again, I want to restate this
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.440]   because I'm a little bit concerned
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.000]   that maybe a clip of this is going to be taken
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.780]   and sent elsewhere, and someone will get the impression
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:39.800]   that I'm saying that we actually want to drink high pH water
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.640]   that we all need to buy expensive high pH water.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.580]   Turns out that's not the case.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:47.720]   If you're consuming tap water from a location
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.280]   where levels of a magnesium
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:51.440]   are sufficiently high in that tap water,
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.180]   again, where the level of magnesium
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:57.340]   is 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter of water,
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.620]   that is if the water coming out of your tap is hard enough,
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.540]   well then chances are you don't need
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.340]   to enhance the pH of that water
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:06.000]   or change its magnesium concentration.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.860]   If however, the water that you're drinking from the tap,
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:11.320]   filtered or not, I would hope filtered,
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:17.560]   contains less than 8.3 milligrams per liter of magnesium,
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.900]   well then chances are the pH of that water
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.460]   is going to be low enough
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:26.060]   that it's not going to be lending itself
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:28.760]   to some of the favorable health components
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.420]   that higher pH water can.
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:33.500]   Notice I did not say that lower pH,
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.940]   AKA more acidic water is bad for you.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.100]   I didn't say that.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.700]   I said that higher pH water can be good for you.
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:43.140]   So let's talk about how and why higher pH water
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.980]   can be good for you and some of the best
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:47.300]   and in fact very inexpensive sources
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:49.560]   of higher pH magnesium enhanced
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:53.440]   or simply tap water that contains sufficient magnesium
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.300]   can be used and accessed.
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.520]   Many of you are probably wondering
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.340]   whether or not you can simply boil your tap water
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:03.100]   and thereby decontaminate the tap water.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.460]   There I want to caution you.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.980]   It turns out that some of the contaminants present in water
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:09.780]   are actually made worse by heating water.
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:12.100]   And again, I don't want to open up
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:14.660]   a whole catalog of different fears.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.460]   I like all of you I presume use water to cook,
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:20.140]   pasta, rice, because I'm an omnivore.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:21.560]   I do consume those things.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.400]   I confess if I make yerba mate or any kind of tea or coffee,
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.520]   I tend to use a higher quality water source than tap water
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.440]   even if that top water is filtered
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:33.660]   because I like the taste far more
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:35.740]   if I use a really good source of water.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.640]   And again, because I'm not consuming those beverages
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.980]   in enormous volumes,
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:42.180]   that becomes a relatively inexpensive endeavor.
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:46.340]   But I would caution people against using boiling
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.580]   or heating of water as the only method
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.460]   to decontaminate their tap water
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:53.580]   and instead to also rely on some of the filtration systems
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:55.000]   that I talked about before.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.980]   And as long as we're talking about the temperature of water,
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:01.220]   there is sort of an ongoing debate online.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.100]   It's not a huge debate,
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.740]   but a number of people engaged in this debate
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:06.220]   as to whether or not drinking really cold water
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:10.280]   or room temperature water is better for you or worse for you.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.620]   This is a tough one to resolve.
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:15.960]   It turns out that if water is very, very cold,
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.320]   that is if you drink it and you can feel that cold water
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:21.460]   making its way down to your gut
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.500]   and you can actually feel it as cold within your gut,
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.120]   and that's sort of a back of the envelope,
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.880]   or I should say direct within the gut measure
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.080]   of cold versus body temperature water,
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.540]   that it is going to be slower to absorb.
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:37.220]   That is, you're going to feel it sloshing around
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.200]   in your stomach for a bit longer
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.580]   than if you were to consume water that is slightly warmer.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:45.820]   Now, that is not to say that you should ingest warm water
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:47.480]   or room temperature water.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.580]   However, many people find that when they drink
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.740]   very cold water or ice water,
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:56.800]   that indeed it can alter the kind of sensation
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:58.060]   of the lining of their stomach
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.800]   in ways that at least to them
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.720]   feel like it's altering their digestion.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:02.560]   And that makes sense.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.380]   The cells that line the gut are very temperature sensitive.
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:08.440]   You want this, so for a number of reasons,
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.060]   including not consuming food that is excessively hot or cold
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:13.740]   or damaging your gut.
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:17.360]   But in general, most people know the temperature of fluid
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.460]   that they want to ingest,
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.940]   and ingest that temperature of fluid.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:22.100]   So most people, for instance, on a cold day
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.060]   want a warm or hot fluid.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.500]   Does that mean that you're not going to absorb
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:26.380]   that warm or hot fluid?
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.580]   No, of course it doesn't.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:29.960]   You're going to absorb that fluid one way or the other.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.420]   So drink fluids at the temperatures
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.280]   that are to your liking in that moment.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.860]   In other words, what you desire in that moment.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.460]   And don't worry so much about trying to avoid cold beverages
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.020]   or trying to make sure that you're always consuming
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.020]   room temperature water as opposed to cold water.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.580]   So now with your understanding of hard water,
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:46.740]   soft water, magnesium,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.340]   the relationship between magnesium, calcium,
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:49.260]   and the pH of water.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:50.860]   And remember our earlier conversation
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:54.460]   where we talked about how higher pH water
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:56.700]   is actually going to move out of the gut
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.160]   and into the body a bit more readily
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.780]   and across those aquaporin channels more readily
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.140]   than lower pH, more acidic water.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.560]   Well, that raises the question of whether or not
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.980]   all these different forms of water that are out there,
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:10.460]   reverse osmosis water, distilled water,
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.780]   double distilled water.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:15.660]   Deuterium depleted water, alkaline water,
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:16.880]   as it's often called.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.920]   Whether or not any or all of that
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.900]   has meaningful health outcomes.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:24.580]   Here we can address some of those items pretty quickly.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:29.140]   For instance, distilled water and double distilled water
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:31.360]   is essentially distilled of,
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.800]   that is it has magnesium and calcium removed from it.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.740]   So my recommendation would be to not drink distilled water.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:41.540]   There may be specific circumstances
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:44.780]   where somebody has very high levels of blood magnesium
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:46.940]   or calcium or calcium stores within the body
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:49.740]   that would necessitate them drinking only distilled water.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:52.820]   But that seems like a very isolated kind of niche case.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:55.060]   So in general, consuming distilled water
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:57.620]   is just simply not necessary.
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:00.020]   Now, in terms of reverse osmosis water,
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.500]   what is reverse osmosis water?
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.540]   Reverse osmosis water is water
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.020]   that has been passed repeatedly
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:08.360]   through a series of filters
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:10.740]   that are designed to remove the kinds of contaminants
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:11.820]   we were talking about earlier.
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:13.540]   So some of the basic contaminants
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.740]   like disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:19.640]   and some other large and small molecules
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.940]   that leaves the water
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.580]   ideally still containing magnesium and calcium.
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:25.780]   Although there's some evidence that reverse osmosis water
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.700]   can deprive water of some of the magnesium and calcium.
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:32.080]   So if you are going to use reverse osmosis filters
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.300]   and drink reverse osmosis water,
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.860]   you want to make sure that you're still getting
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:38.340]   the magnesium concentrations present in that water
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:40.100]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:41.580]   But in general,
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.780]   reverse osmosis water is considered safe,
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.500]   but, and for many people,
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.180]   this is going to be an important but,
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:49.180]   but very expensive to access.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.840]   The reverse osmosis filters
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.620]   require a lot of changing of the filters,
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:54.680]   purchasing reverse osmosis water
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:57.020]   in its stable form within containers,
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:58:58.540]   these are typically glass containers,
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:01.120]   is going to be pretty expensive
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.980]   and prohibitive for most people.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.860]   That said, there are a number of people out there
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:08.160]   that really like the taste of reverse osmosis water.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.060]   They report it as feeling more smooth.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:13.620]   They think of reverse osmosis water as quote unquote,
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.180]   giving them energy.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.200]   To be quite honest,
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.840]   there's no direct studies of the subjective sensation
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.040]   of water in the mouth and in the gut
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.880]   and its relative health effects.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:28.640]   Again, the smoothness of water as one drinks it
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:31.020]   and goes down the gut,
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.200]   really has no direct relationship to the quote unquote,
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.140]   hardness or softness of water.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:37.520]   I know that's going to shock a number of you.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.360]   You probably think,
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.780]   well, hard water is going to be hard to drink.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:41.180]   And it turns out that's not the case.
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:44.000]   In fact, many people find that with elevated levels
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.480]   of magnesium and calcium and water,
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:48.760]   it actually tastes smoother or softer in their mouth.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.460]   So hard water tastes smooth or soft.
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.680]   I know it's all very counterintuitive,
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:55.880]   but I think it's important to point this out
[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:58.180]   because a number of times you'll hear
[01:59:58.180 --> 01:59:59.900]   or read about filtering water
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:01.540]   so that it tastes smoother and better.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:03.060]   And oftentimes that's happening
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:05.780]   because the quote unquote, hardness of water,
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.700]   that is the concentrations of magnesium and calcium
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.340]   are actually increasing.
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.720]   So if you're somebody who's curious
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.020]   about reverse osmosis water and you can afford the filters
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:17.040]   or the reverse osmosis water already pre-filtered,
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:18.500]   please be my guest, drink it.
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:20.600]   I'm certainly not trying to prevent anyone from drinking it,
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:23.200]   but there's no peer reviewed evidence that I am aware of
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.400]   that conclusively shows that drinking reverse osmosis water
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.520]   is far better for us than drinking other types of water
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.100]   provided the other types of water
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:33.140]   are adequately filtered of fluoride
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:34.940]   and the sorts of disinfectant byproducts
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:36.200]   that we talked about earlier.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.620]   So what about hydrogen water?
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:40.340]   You may have heard of this or hydrogen enriched water
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:43.280]   or electrolyzed reduced water
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.160]   as a way to access hydrogen enriched water.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.540]   All this might sound pretty crazy to some of you.
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:52.220]   Now, fortunately for sake of today's discussion,
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:55.020]   we can take a number of the different categories
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:58.940]   of let's call it unique categories of water
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:01.500]   that have been described, including deuterium depleted water.
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.900]   And by the way, deuterium is something that relates
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:07.020]   to the presence of hydrogen ions in water.
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:11.340]   And put very simply, water that is extracted from sources
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:13.000]   that are closer to sea level
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.420]   tend to have more deuterium in them
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:17.900]   than water that is extracted from sources
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:18.980]   further from sea level.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:20.460]   So up in the mountains, for instance,
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.580]   and from springs further away from oceans.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.620]   As you get closer to sea level,
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:28.300]   the sources of water separate from sea water
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:29.500]   tend to have more deuterium,
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:34.500]   which relates to the enrichment or lack of hydrogen
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:37.340]   within that water or free hydrogen within that water.
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:40.620]   I warned you, this was all going to sound pretty niche
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:42.180]   and that we were going to get a little bit into the chemistry
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:44.340]   but now I'm going to make it all very simple for you.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:47.380]   At least for the non-efficinado.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:51.180]   Electrolyzed reduced water,
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.560]   which is a method of using electricity
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:57.740]   to alter the confirmation of the water molecules
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.320]   and their rates of movement as well,
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:03.420]   as well as so-called hydrogen rich water
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:08.420]   or hydrogen enriched water or deuterium depleted water,
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:12.960]   all have the property of having higher levels of pH
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.260]   than other forms of water,
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.740]   such as distilled water, reverse osmosis water,
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:20.500]   and generally higher pH than the kind of water
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:21.580]   that comes out of your tap,
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:24.700]   unless you live in a region where your tap water
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:27.820]   has very high levels of magnesium in it,
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:30.060]   which does occur in certain regions of the world
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:31.380]   but is not that common.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.860]   More typically, the water that comes out of your tap
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:37.080]   does not have enough magnesium,
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.980]   meaning not as much magnesium in it as you would like.
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:44.000]   And this I believe explains in a fairly straightforward way
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.580]   why there is such an appeal of these pH enhanced
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.140]   or alkaline waters or electrolyzed reduced water
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.320]   or deuterium depleted water.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.300]   There are a couple of reasons,
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.460]   but first of all,
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.540]   anytime someone is consuming a specialized form of water,
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.340]   chances are it's going to be filtered
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:03.220]   of the disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:04.860]   and the other things that you really don't want in water.
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:06.660]   So already the water is going to be cleaner
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:08.340]   than would be coming out of the tap.
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.300]   So that's going to indirectly explain
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:13.420]   a number of the so-called health benefits,
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:15.240]   both subjective and perhaps even objective
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:16.120]   as we'll talk about,
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:19.000]   that can result from consuming these other,
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.660]   let's say more esoteric forms of water,
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:25.140]   at least not of simple tap water.
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:30.000]   However, if you look at hydrogen or hydrogen enriched water,
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.900]   you really need to take a step back and ask, what is that?
[02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.420]   What are we really talking about?
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:35.940]   Because it turns out that you can create
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:37.380]   hydrogen enriched water
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:41.160]   by putting tablets of magnesium itself,
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.700]   small amounts of magnesium, dissolving those in water.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:45.940]   It will give off a kind of gaseous solution.
[02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:47.220]   You'll see a bunch of bubbling in there.
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.360]   You certainly want to dilute that tablet
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.140]   and then consume the water.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:54.580]   And yes, it's true what you've heard about and read
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:55.820]   from these commercial sources.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.520]   You do want to consume that water
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:00.180]   within about five to 15 minutes
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:03.060]   after that tablet completes dissolving.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:04.340]   Now, why would you do this?
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:08.020]   And I should say that I have now started doing this,
[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:09.980]   not because I necessarily think
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:13.340]   that it's so necessary or so beneficial.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:14.620]   I'll talk about my experience in a moment.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:17.060]   I did it in anticipation of this episode
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:19.800]   because I was researching water and hydrogen enriched water
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:21.100]   and all these alkaline waters.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.060]   And what became very clear to me
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:26.040]   based on reading a fantastic two-part review,
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.900]   it's a very extensive review entitled,
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:30.140]   or at least the first part is entitled
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.180]   Electrolyzed Reduced Water.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.500]   Molecular hydrogen is the exclusive agent responsible
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.720]   for the therapeutic effects.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.340]   And then there's a second part to this review.
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.380]   This is how extensive is entitled
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:42.340]   Electrolyzed Reduced Water.
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.700]   Number two, safety concerns and effectiveness
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.460]   as a source of hydrogen water.
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:49.500]   What this review, which we've linked to in the show notes,
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:52.100]   points to is that all of the health benefits
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.460]   of these different forms of water
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:55.380]   that you hear about out there,
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:58.660]   deuterium depleted, hydrogen enriched, et cetera,
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:01.860]   all seem to boil down, no pun intended,
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:03.780]   no boiling included, I should say,
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:08.520]   to the elevation in hydrogen that translates into,
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.420]   and here's the really meaningful change,
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:12.840]   the elevation in pH that occurs
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.060]   when you hydrogen enrich water.
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:18.560]   Now, there are not a lot of clinical studies
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:20.140]   looking at hydrogen enriched water,
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:23.180]   but there are starting to be more than a few.
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:26.000]   And one that I'd like to point out and that we'll link to
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.400]   was published fairly recently,
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.380]   which is entitled hydrogen-rich water
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:33.460]   reduces inflammatory responses and prevents apoptosis.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:36.180]   Apotosis is a naturally occurring cell death
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:38.220]   during development and is generally used
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:40.220]   to describe cell death of the body.
[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:41.920]   Sometimes this can be good cell death, by the way,
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.120]   removing cells that need to be removed.
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:46.220]   Again, the title of the paper is hydrogen-rich water
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:49.000]   reduces inflammatory responses and prevents apoptosis
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.120]   of peripheral blood cells in healthy adults,
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.180]   a randomized double-blind control trial.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:57.220]   Now, this paper looked at the effects
[02:05:57.220 --> 02:06:02.220]   of drinking 1.5 liters per day of hydrogen enriched water
[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:04.580]   for a period of four weeks.
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:09.240]   They did find significant positive benefits
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:12.560]   of reduced inflammation, and they found these changes
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:15.520]   by way of analyzing things like interleukin-6
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.840]   and some of the other interleukins,
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:18.600]   which are markers of inflammation.
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:20.800]   They controlled very nicely for the fact
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:23.220]   that people were still consuming other forms of water
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:24.500]   and liquid and coffee, et cetera,
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.380]   although they made sure that they weren't consuming
[02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:28.240]   too much coffee and soda
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.960]   in addition to this hydrogen enriched water.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.000]   But what this paper shows is that indeed,
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.700]   increasing the free hydrogen in water
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:40.720]   can improve certain health metrics in these cells.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.600]   And this is in keeping with some of the subjective reports
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:47.200]   that people have stated out there
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:48.600]   and that I myself experienced.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.400]   I have to say that by drinking hydrogen rich water,
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.400]   which I'll tell you how to do fairly inexpensively
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:57.460]   in a moment, you do get the subjective experience
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:01.960]   of having more energy, of feeling better, quote unquote.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.940]   Now, keep in mind, of course, the placebo effect
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:06.260]   is a very real and powerful effect,
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:07.760]   so it could just be placebo.
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.220]   Although in this paper, they did, of course,
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.020]   include a placebo group, so people didn't know
[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:13.080]   if they were getting hydrogen rich water
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.080]   or non-hydrogen rich water.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.960]   I should also mention that the improvements
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:20.400]   in health metrics that they observed in this study
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:25.120]   were only observed for individuals older than 30 years old.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.680]   Why that is, I don't know.
[02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:28.320]   The conclusions these authors came to
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:31.960]   in terms of how these individuals older than 30
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.280]   achieved lower levels, or I should say,
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:38.120]   reduced levels of inflammation and improved markers
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:40.440]   of other aspects of biological function
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.640]   is that the hydrogen water improved
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:48.460]   the biological antioxidant potential of certain cell types.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.280]   And again, the cell types that they mainly focused on
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:53.340]   were these peripheral blood cells in this particular study.
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.480]   Now, how could this be?
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.300]   Why would this be?
[02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:57.280]   Well, this goes back to our earlier discussion
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:00.640]   about reduction in reactive oxygen species,
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:04.120]   so-called ROSs, and reductions in free radicals
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:05.520]   that can damage cells.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:08.320]   So if all of this is sounding very convoluted,
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:09.800]   I can understand why.
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:11.980]   However, what I like about this study
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.720]   and the two reviews that I mentioned a moment ago
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.960]   is that these studies don't really say
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.200]   that hydrogen rich water is what's essential.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.100]   What these studies really point to
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:25.340]   is that the changes in pH of water
[02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:29.340]   that enhancing the hydrogen in water can create
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:34.180]   is what leads to the enhanced either absorption
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:38.360]   and/or ability of cells to utilize that higher pH water,
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:42.680]   again, not by changing the pH of the body or of cells,
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.800]   but simply because higher pH water,
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:50.440]   or we could perhaps more accurately state less acidic water,
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:53.820]   that is harder water that contains more magnesium and calcium
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:57.300]   seems to be more readily used by the cells of the body,
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.960]   and therefore, it's very likely that the individuals
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:02.720]   in this study were achieving higher
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:05.440]   or more efficient levels of hydration.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.680]   Okay, so if any of this is confusing,
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.240]   let me be very clear.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:11.800]   I do not believe that we all need
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.920]   to drink deuterium depleted water,
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.280]   or that we all need to drink electrolyzed reduced water,
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.820]   nor do I necessarily believe
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:22.680]   that we all need to drink hydrogen rich water.
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:24.460]   However, it's very clear to me
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:28.540]   that all these different forms of water are better absorbed
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:32.200]   and therefore lead to better and more efficient hydration,
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.560]   and therefore can reduce inflammation, blood pressure,
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:38.200]   and improve a number of other health metrics
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.440]   because of the elevated pH
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.540]   that all of these different purification
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.980]   or water treatment methods achieve,
[02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:46.440]   and that elevated pH, again,
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.920]   is not changing the pH of the cells and tissues
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.820]   and organs of your body.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.280]   You actually don't want that.
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.760]   Rather, that elevated pH is simply making the water
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:57.400]   less acidic than it would be otherwise.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.680]   So the simple takeaway is this.
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.520]   If your tap water contains sufficient magnesium
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.240]   per the values that we talked about earlier,
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.640]   I don't think you need to hydrogen enrich your water.
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:11.620]   I do, however, suggest that you at least analyze your water
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:15.640]   or look at some of the professional analysis of water
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:17.240]   that you can achieve online
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.960]   and filter out disinfectant byproducts and fluorides,
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:24.920]   et cetera, from that magnesium,
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.800]   or I should say sufficiently magnesium containing water.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.760]   Put simply, if your tap water has enough magnesium,
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.000]   filter it, but drink it, and I think you're doing just fine.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.720]   If, however, the levels of magnesium in your tap water
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:41.240]   are not above that value that we talked about earlier,
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.400]   in that case, I do think,
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.440]   and I can completely understand why,
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.780]   enriching the amount of hydrogen in that water
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:52.940]   can make that water not only more palatable, right,
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:55.880]   give you the sensation that it's softer or smoother
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:00.160]   or more enjoyable to drink than more acidic water would be,
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.520]   but also that that water is going to be far more effective
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:06.040]   in being absorbed and hydrating the cells
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:06.920]   and tissues of your body,
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.280]   which turns out to be very important for an enormous range,
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:13.760]   perhaps every biological function within your brain and body.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:17.000]   So how can you hydrogen enrich your water?
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000]   That actually can be done fairly inexpensively.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.720]   I've been doing that, as I mentioned earlier,
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:24.460]   as part of an experiment in preparation for this episode,
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:26.720]   because it turns out that the water that comes out of my tap
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.400]   has very little magnesium in it
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.600]   and very little calcium as well.
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.840]   The way to create hydrogen rich water
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:36.840]   is you can simply purchase molecular hydrogen tablets,
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:39.680]   which in reality are just magnesium tablets
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.020]   that dissolve in water and create a free hydrogen
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:45.640]   that can interact with the other water molecules.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.480]   Now, the chemistry behind it has been substantiated
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.540]   and I'll provide a link in the show note captions
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:54.000]   to a paper that gets into some fairly extensive detail
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000]   about the way that having an additional hydrogen
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.240]   in your water can adjust the flow of electrons
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.240]   and the adjustment of free radicals.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.880]   But keep in mind, again, this is all through increases
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.520]   in the pH of your water.
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.980]   And please keep in mind that you can't simply take any other
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.960]   or any old magnesium tablet or capsule
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.320]   and put it into water.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:17.080]   The configuration of the magnesium in these capsules
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:21.120]   and tablets is such that it allows a rapid dissolving
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:24.640]   of the tablet and the activation of the free hydrogen
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.620]   that can interact with the water molecules.
[02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:28.860]   Again, there are only a few scientific studies
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:31.520]   exploring the real biological effects
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.560]   of these activated hydrogen waters.
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.380]   The dissolvable tablets are the far less expensive way to go
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.920]   than purchasing pre-packaged and sealed hydrogen water.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:45.060]   In fact, I don't recommend those brands
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:47.800]   because they are quite expensive
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:50.520]   and it's not clear how stable the activated
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:53.500]   or free hydrogen is in those waters.
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:55.820]   In any case, this is certainly not something
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.500]   that everyone needs to do.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:00.400]   I mention it because I have had a good experience
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:01.240]   with it myself.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.680]   I also will mention again that I have no business
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:06.300]   or affiliation to any of these products.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:07.580]   I'll provide a link to a few of them
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:09.280]   in the show note captions for those of you
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:10.240]   that want to experiment.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.640]   And indeed, that's why I'm telling you this.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.280]   For those of you that want to experiment
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.440]   with raising the pH of your water
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.160]   without having to purchase what is ordinarily
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:20.840]   quite expensive higher pH water,
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:23.800]   you can do this with these dissolvable magnesium tablets.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:26.260]   My experience with them has been quite good.
[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:29.820]   In fact, I plan to continue to use them once or twice a day.
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.000]   This is not the sort of thing that you need to do
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.660]   in all the water that you drink.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:36.080]   I want to repeat, even if you go down this path
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.640]   and you find that you really like
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:40.260]   the activated hydrogen tablet approach,
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:42.220]   it is not the case that you want to put these
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:43.520]   in all of your water.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.080]   And you certainly don't want to put them
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.300]   in carbonated waters of any kind.
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:49.580]   That will lead to a lot of gastric discomfort,
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.280]   nor do you want to put them into hot liquids of any kind.
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:54.340]   So again, this is the sort of thing that you do once
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:57.100]   or twice, maybe three times a day.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:58.540]   And you can find out for yourself
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:01.200]   and sort of measure subjectively whether or not
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.920]   you like the experience and whether or not
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.840]   you quote unquote feel better.
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:06.000]   Now, earlier in the episode,
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.280]   we were discussing structured water
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.520]   or this fourth phase of water.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.320]   I know a number of people out there are curious
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:15.160]   as to whether or not ingesting structured water
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:17.320]   is somehow better for us
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:20.640]   than ingesting non-structured water.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.460]   All I can say about this is that
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:24.760]   it is a very controversial thing
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.440]   to suggest that structured water
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.040]   is somehow more biologically effective
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:32.300]   or better for us than non-structured water.
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:33.640]   There are a number of different ways
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:36.280]   that one can create structured water.
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.040]   They involve some pretty extensive
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.960]   and expensive at-home systems,
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:43.060]   ranging anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:45.400]   to a couple of thousand dollars or more.
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.600]   To be quite direct,
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:49.780]   when one goes into the peer-reviewed scientific literature,
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:53.000]   one will not find that is there is essentially
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.860]   no real evidence that ingesting structured water
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:01.400]   leads to any specific desired biological outcomes.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.000]   As I say that, I'm sure there are people out there
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.480]   who have still had tremendous experiences
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:08.040]   ingesting structured water,
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.740]   whether or not that's due to a placebo effect
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.960]   or a real effect of ingesting structured water,
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:13.340]   isn't it clear?
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:15.200]   Just to give you a sense of what my stance is
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.760]   on things like structured water,
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.880]   I think that they are interesting and intriguing,
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.260]   but as a scientist,
[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:23.800]   in the absence of any quality peer-reviewed data at present,
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:25.680]   I can't really suggest that people go out
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.820]   and start ingesting structured water,
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:30.720]   nor that they adhere to the claims
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:33.060]   that structured water is going to be really,
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:35.280]   really good for them compared to other forms of water.
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:38.240]   That said, I do think that there's an interesting
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:40.520]   and open space for further exploration
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.820]   of the biological effects of structured water,
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:45.760]   given the fact that structured water does exist,
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:47.440]   I don't think anyone debates that,
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:49.760]   and the fact that the different structures of water
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:52.220]   in this fourth phase of water, as we're calling it,
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:54.360]   has been shown to interface with solids
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.580]   and other aspects of liquids,
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:00.520]   and can do so within organelles of cells,
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.320]   so different components of cells
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.660]   that control different functions, including mitochondria.
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:06.360]   I think there's a potential there,
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.000]   whether or not there's a promise there
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.600]   is another question entirely.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:13.200]   So I don't want to shut the door on structured water.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.600]   I think this is an open question
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:17.020]   that I hope there will be more data
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:20.280]   to answer those questions in the not too distant future.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.120]   And meanwhile, if any of you are aware
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:25.560]   of good clinical studies exploring the biological effects
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.600]   of structured water in either animal models or humans,
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.240]   please put those references in the comments on YouTube,
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:34.680]   because I'm very curious as to how this area
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:36.880]   of biological effects of structured water
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:39.320]   is evolving and continues to evolve.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:40.920]   So today we discussed water,
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.960]   and admittedly, we went into a lot of detail
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:47.220]   about the physics and chemistry of water in its various forms
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:48.980]   and we talked about hydration,
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:50.320]   because I think that's the main reason
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.100]   why many of you are interested in or concerned about water.
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.040]   We also talked about contaminants in tap water,
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:59.800]   which unfortunately do exist and are very prominent
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.800]   in essentially all regions of the world.
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:03.600]   So please do get some information
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.180]   about what's coming out of your tap.
[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:07.780]   I also want to throw in one other piece of information
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.640]   that's really critical that I learned about
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:10.780]   when researching this episode,
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:14.380]   which is the quality of water that comes out of your tap
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:16.880]   is not just dictated by the source that it comes from
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:19.220]   external to your home or apartment,
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.000]   your pipes are also important,
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.540]   and that filter or that little mesh
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:28.060]   that sits at the faucet head is also very important.
[02:17:28.060 --> 02:17:29.620]   Most people don't pay attention to that,
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.820]   but it turns out that a lot of debris and contaminants
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:36.740]   can be derived from that little filter
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:39.820]   that most people just simply aren't cleaning often enough.
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:43.460]   So here, I'm not trying to tell you that the metal
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:46.780]   or the plastic that that filter is made of is a problem.
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:50.000]   More often than not, contaminants are showing up in water
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.940]   because people aren't cleaning those filters often enough.
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:55.120]   And in fact, prior to researching this episode,
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.940]   I didn't ever think to clean that filter.
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:17:59.420]   I looked underneath my faucet
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.700]   and while that filter didn't look
[02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:03.920]   particularly filled with debris,
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:05.100]   I did find that when I took it off
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:06.400]   and I looked at the other side,
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.900]   there was quite a lot of debris.
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.580]   So if you are going to consume tap water,
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:11.460]   you definitely want to consider the source,
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:13.400]   the pipes in your building or your apartment,
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.660]   the ones that lead right up to your glass or jug
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:18.780]   that you would put that water into,
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:21.420]   and also that mesh that that water passes through
[02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:23.980]   as it goes into that glass or jug.
[02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:26.620]   We also talked about how much water to drink.
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.980]   I hope that we finally resolve that question
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:31.060]   for those of you that have been wondering about that.
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:33.380]   The Galpin equation is a wonderful approach
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:36.660]   to how much water to consume during exercise.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:38.900]   And by providing these other formulas
[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:42.920]   of about eight ounces or 240 milliliters of water per hour
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:47.260]   for the 10 hours from waking until post-waking on average,
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:48.100]   remember it's averages,
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:50.340]   you don't have to consume them every hour on the hour
[02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:52.340]   and no need to be neurotic.
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.620]   Hopefully you can achieve better levels of hydration
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:57.920]   which we know can lead to reductions in blood pressure,
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.420]   improvements in appetite, mood, and focus.
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.540]   And I really think that it's the improvements
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:06.900]   in cognitive focus and physical ability,
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.500]   both endurance, strength, and other forms of kind of
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:10.660]   readiness in the body,
[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:12.480]   readiness to perform work in the body
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.700]   that really are best supported by the hydration literature.
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.520]   And then of course,
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:18.060]   we went through the different forms of water
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.540]   that you hear about out there and addressed
[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:22.700]   which ones are going to be beneficial or not,
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:24.160]   and perhaps more importantly,
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.700]   why any of them would be beneficial.
[02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:29.780]   Thinking about that from the perspective of biologists
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:31.380]   and the chemistry of water.
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:33.660]   And I do hope that by arriving at this point
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:36.500]   in the episode now that you have a much better understanding
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:38.620]   of the chemistry and physics of water
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:42.140]   and the way that water can powerfully impact your biology.

[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:12.380]   mentioned at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:14.780]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.640]   On various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.820]   we discuss supplements.
[02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:20.060]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:21.980]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:25.220]   for things like improving sleep, supporting hormones,
[02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:26.780]   improving focus, and so on.
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:28.620]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:29.700]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.060]   We've done that for several reasons.
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.860]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:34.300]   are the very highest quality
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:36.780]   and are used with various sports teams
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:38.540]   and various studies through the Department of Defense
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:39.480]   and so on.
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:41.660]   And Momentous Supplements tend to be
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.820]   in single ingredient formulations.
[02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:46.180]   Single ingredient formulations are absolutely essential
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:48.320]   if you are going to develop the most cost-effective
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.140]   and biologically effective supplement regimen for you,
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:54.300]   because simply put, they allow you to adjust the dosage
[02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:56.540]   of individual ingredients, to alternate days
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:57.740]   that you take different ingredients,
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:59.860]   to cycle them, and so forth.
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:01.600]   In addition, Momentous Supplements
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:03.340]   are available internationally,
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:05.320]   which many other supplements are not.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:06.820]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:07.980]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:10.380]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:12.920]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:14.820]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:18.060]   it's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
[02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:19.520]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:20.980]   And at all of those places,
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:22.620]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.180]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:25.300]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.560]   but much of which is distinct from the content covered
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:28.660]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:31.500]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.620]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:34.780]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast neural network newsletter,
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:37.980]   it's a monthly newsletter that includes free toolkits,
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:39.680]   things like toolkit for sleep,
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:42.860]   how to enhance the quality and duration of your sleep,
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:44.940]   toolkit for focus, toolkit for neuroplasticity,
[02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:47.100]   toolkit for deliberate cold exposure, heat exposure,
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:48.980]   and summaries of podcast episodes.
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:50.280]   All of those toolkits can be found
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:53.180]   by going to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:55.500]   scroll down to newsletter, and simply give us your email.
[02:21:55.500 --> 02:21:57.420]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:21:57.420 --> 02:21:58.840]   And again, the newsletters and toolkits
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.980]   are completely zero cost.
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:02.660]   And you will also find some PDF examples
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:03.680]   of previous toolkits.
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.600]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com.
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.900]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:08.900]   all about the science,
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:11.700]   including the chemistry, physics, and biology of water,
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:14.200]   and how your body utilizes water.
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.360]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.120]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.700]   [upbeat music]
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:23.280]   (upbeat music)
