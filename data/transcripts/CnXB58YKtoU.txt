[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Every year I anticipate John Piper's message at the Passion Conference in early January.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.280]   And this year in Atlanta he preached on Revelation chapter 13 in a message titled "The Beast,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   the Book, and the Beauty of the Lamb."
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.840]   It is worth listening to the entire message.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.680]   But here's a clip from Revelation 13, 8 where Pastor John explains that the slaying of the
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.360]   Lamb of God was planned before the universe existed.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360]   Mind-boggling.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.840]   Here's John Piper to explain.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.320]   In verse 8 we have now arrived at our first point on the journey and our roadmap, namely
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.440]   in eternity past, and we see it in the phrase "before the foundation of the world."
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.680]   Are you with me?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.960]   We are now before the foundation of the world.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.080]   So let's read it again.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.840]   What happened there?
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.240]   All who dwell on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.860]   the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.680]   There is a book before the foundation of the world, and the book has a name.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.040]   And the name of the book is the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:44.000]   Which means that in the mind of the author of this book, the Lamb is slain.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.060]   It is as good as done, and the author of this book is God.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.260]   The slaying of the Lamb of God was the plan of God before the universe.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.260]   You with me?
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.380]   Is that in the verse?
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.500]   The slaying of the Lamb of God was the plan before the universe existed.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.760]   The slaying of the Lamb of God was the plan before history existed.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.480]   The slaying of the Lamb of God was the plan before sin existed.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.700]   If Satan, together with Adam and Eve, thought when he brought sin into the world that he
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.240]   was wrecking God's plan, he's a fool.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.200]   He didn't wreck it, he set it up.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:57.520]   Because it was the plan that there be a slain Lamb before the foundation of the world.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.960]   Now we're going to go back to verse 8, there's lots more there, but we're taking our first
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:11.480]   tour first, and now we're going to go to the end of history, into eternity future.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.440]   We're going to go to chapter 5, verses 9 and 10, and see what they're singing about there.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.080]   It's all over now, history's over.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.800]   This little footnote called passion is over.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.440]   And now we're going to listen to the song of heaven.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   And they sang a new song, "Worthy are you to take the scroll."
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Now why?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   Why would they say he's worthy?
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   "Worthy are you to take the scroll, because you were slain."
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.760]   That's why we're going to sing.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.640]   That's what we're going to say about the worth of the Lamb forever.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.280]   You were slain and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and tongue
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.400]   and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.560]   will reign on the earth.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   That's what we're going to sing.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.520]   We're going to sing bloody songs forever.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.320]   Because the center of everything, it is the central song of the universe, is the slain
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   Lamb.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.080]   It is the plan from eternity.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.280]   It is the song for eternity.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   Chapter 5, verse 12, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.240]   and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing because he was slain."
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.460]   Or chapter 17, verse 10, "Great multitudes without number saying, 'Salvation belongs
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.840]   to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.'"
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.280]   So the slain Lamb is the song of the universe forever.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.320]   That's what Revelation shows us in all of his strangeness.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.480]   So in eternity past, the plan.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.000]   A Lamb will be slain.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.320]   In eternity future, a song.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.640]   He was slain and he is infinitely worthy because of it.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   Amen.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   I love that clip.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.080]   And you'll want to listen to the full message for yourself.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   It's titled, "The Beast, the Book, and the Beauty of the Lamb" on Revelation chapter
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.680]   13, verses 1 to 10, preached on January 3rd at Passion 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.160]   The message, audio, and video can be found online at DesiringGod.org, of course.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.640]   Well, when it comes to giving 10% of my income to a church, my tithe, can I split the money
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.160]   and give, say, 5% to my church and 5% to a non-profit Christian ministry?
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.480]   That is the question on the table tomorrow for Pastor John.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.120]   I'll see you then.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   [END]
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   "The Beast, the Book, and the Beauty of the Lamb"
