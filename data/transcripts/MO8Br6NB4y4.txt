[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   I know a lot of really wealthy people who are miserable because they work all
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.760]   the time or their, their job takes them away from their family, or they work
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.920]   on a job that is kind of soul sucking and not happy to them.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960]   So there has to be some sort of balance between looking at this number in my
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.160]   portfolio and the, the number is the only thing that matters and this, these are
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.760]   the goalposts versus having a more balanced life, there's things that happen
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.360]   in your life that can change how you view that saving stuff and obviously
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.960]   everyone's different.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.280]   Some people have a problem spending too much money.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   Some people save too much.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.040]   Some people are in the middle.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   I've tried to bring my financial life more in balance to think of a wealthy
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.120]   life, more as enjoying some of it now, while still making sure future
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.840]   me is going to be sad.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.720]   We've had clients in our wealth management firm who plan their whole
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   life and they get to the point where it's retirement time and they dropped
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   out of a deadly disease, right, right.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.680]   As they're about to finally enjoy their money.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.320]   having those kind of experiences has shaped and changed me.
