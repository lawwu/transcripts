[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   How did our Bible pages get so cluttered?
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.200]   If you open your Bible at a random page, you'll find verse and chapter numbers have been added, of course.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.100]   And often the text has been scrunched into a two-column layout, like no other book we read,
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.200]   and often with a bunch of tiny cross-references printed down the middle of those two columns.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   Section headings have been added, and so too have been book introductions and often study notes,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.400]   colorful images, call-out boxes on the pages, and a concordance and maps and other things in the back.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.200]   Our Bibles are loaded with extra clutter.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.500]   The history of how our Bibles got so jammed with notes and markings is a long one,
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.100]   and Bible readers are beginning to ask what the clutter is doing to the psychology of our Bible reading.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.800]   And should we be preserving space in our lives to read the Bible without all of these markings?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.300]   I connected with Glenn Powell, the executive director of the Biblica Institute for Bible Reading,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.800]   a think tank dedicated to studying trends in Bible reading and design.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   Glenn is also the author of the new book, "Saving the Bible from Ourselves, Learning to Read and Live the Bible Well."
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   We recently sat down and recorded this weekend conversation,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.300]   and to start I asked him about the history of verse and chapter numbers that we see.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.800]   Who added those to our Bible?
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   Sure, it's actually a little piece of a bigger story with the Bible.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   It's actually pretty hard to find Bible manuscripts that are perfectly clean with no markings on them at all.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   It's often said that the very first manuscripts were just a series of letters
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.800]   with not even spaces between words and punctuation, that sort of thing,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   which is basically true.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   However, very early on, people started saying, "Look, we need to have these things with helps."
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   The early manuscripts were read out loud, so oftentimes the very first things that appear
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.300]   are breathing marks, little spaces between words, page numbers, those sorts of things.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.800]   And I think what happened over time is we just started inserting more things into the text,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   all with the interest of providing help, of course.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.300]   There were practical reasons for these things.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.800]   But by the time you get to the end of the history of the Bible in our time,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   these helps, these additions, have pretty much overwhelmed the text.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   So, chapter numbers, surprisingly to many people when I speak about this,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.300]   came rather late in the game.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.800]   The chapter system that we know in our Bibles today came from Stephen Langdon,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   who was an English church leader in the early 1200s.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   So to think about the fact that the Bible existed without these chapter numbers
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   for over a thousand years is startling to many people.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   And I think just the realization, I think one big light that comes on for people
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   is to know that the Bible itself has a history as a book,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   and that it developed over time in its format,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   and that the Bible doesn't have to be what we see today.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   And in fact, it always hasn't been what we see today.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   And they're interested to know that verses and chapters have separate histories, really.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   The chapter numbers were inserted--Langdon was actually working on Bible commentaries,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   and so it's very helpful to find the Bible in sections that are easier to find specific pieces.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   So the chapter numbers came in for that reason.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Also, many times, some of the various chapter number systems--
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   there were more than one at various points in the Bible's history--
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   were included so that people could find passages for public reading of Scripture.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   So it's these practical uses that really developed the form,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   the changing form that we see in the Bible.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   Verses came 300 years later in the 1500s,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   and it's interesting, the gentleman who started the verse number system,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   the man that we know, Robert Estienne, a French printer,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   was actually working on a Bible concordance.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   So verses, of course, are more precise than chapters,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   and so he needed something closer to smaller pieces of the Bible than chapter numbers.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   So he inserted verse numbers into a Greek New Testament
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   and added numbers to the Hebrew breathing marks that already existed in the Old Testament,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   and voila, you get the modern chapter and verse Bible for the very first time in the 16th century,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   which is, again, surprisingly late in the Bible's history.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   And again, it's fascinating, I think, to realize that both innovations were added to the text
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   in the search of better reference help, commentaries and concordances,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   and that's what led to the introduction of chapters and verses.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   The history of oral Bible reading is a rich and incredible story of its own,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   but it'll have to wait for another podcast episode.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   I want to talk about the implications of this reference style in a moment.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   When we open our Bibles, we also see a two-column style.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   Where did that originate, and how does that style influence our engagement with the Bible?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   Well, when you think about the scroll, right, opening horizontally, columns had to exist.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   Those lines can't go on forever.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   So, you know, the scrolls certainly had columns.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   It was a question of how long is the length of a column.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   And then when you switch to the codex form of the book, what we would know as a book form,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   first on animal skins and later on paper, it became just a practical matter
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   of being able to fit as much material onto a page as possible.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   And so it was really that practical desire, I think, that drove this.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   Because the Bible's a big book.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   It's hard to fit it into a single volume without putting two columns on the page,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   which really maximizes the use of space with your words.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   The problem I have with double-column Bibles, or even worse, this terrible thing I saw a few years ago,
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   which is a three-column Bible, which was almost impossible to read.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   It squeezes the Bible down into a few hundred pages, but what can you do with it?
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   So the two-column was a page-saving, space-saving device,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   but it really is very hard on things like poetry.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   So Hebrew parallelism, that the lines are always meant to work together,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   they're talking to each other and so forth, this becomes almost impossible to see in a two-column Bible
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   because you can't fit a whole line of the Hebrew text across a column, so you end up indenting.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   Then you have multiple levels of indents, and the page becomes indecipherable.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   You can't really see what's going on with the Hebrew poetry,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   so therefore you don't really read it as poetry, you're just reading words.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   Yeah, that's really key. The Bible is a huge book.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   I mean, that's just reality, and then it's packaged with a lot of added references and other notes and materials.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   How did the rise of concordances change how Christians read the Bible?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   Well, and again, I tell you, it's the desire to make good use of the Bible.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   So concordances are very helpful things, and now, of course, we can do all this electronically.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   It's so fast and so easy to look things up, which is great in many ways.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   The problem is concordance drives you to use the Bible in a particular way,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   and when we back-design or back-format the Bible to fit our desire for something like a concordance,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   then we're changing what the Bible is in its regular presentation.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   So it would be one thing if we said, "Well, we need reference Bibles for when we're using the Bible to reference things."
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   Like when I want to do a word study and I look up words,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   finding the verse number is much faster than scanning a chapter for that word.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   However, when we change the form to fit that particular need,
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   what we've done without really thinking about it is we've hurt reading.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   So when we changed the Bible into a chapter and verse Bible,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   plus added all these other modern additives, cross-references, section headings, footnotes,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   all the other stuff that we put in Bibles, we've really made it hard for people to just flat-out read the Bible.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   And one of the things I contend in my book is we should be reading first and studying second,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   and actually doing our study in the context of having read whole books,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   because that's really what authors intended.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   Their central unit is not a verse, is not a chapter, it's a book.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   Those are the central units the Bible is built on, and I think we should read holistically first,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   and then do our study in the context of that reading.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   And I think the modern Bible reverses those things.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   It does. Yeah, it does. And verses and chapters are two fairly recent phenomena,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   even more recent than newer data smog, as you call it.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   I'm thinking of those tiny cross-reference texts that are listed in Bible margins.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   When you have a column of references to point you to related texts as you read, what's your fear?
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   What does this phenomenon do to our Bible reading?
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   Yeah, it's interesting. I didn't really do the research to know when that originated.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   I should probably track that down. That would be a fascinating piece of this history,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   of the development of the format of the Bible.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   But I know how they function. They function, again, helpfully in the right ways,
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   but the problem is they tend to take over.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   And what it does, again, is I say it prevents long-form, in-depth, kind of lose-yourself-in-the-text reading.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   I don't know if you ever knew the book The Shallows by Nicholas Carr,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   what the Internet is doing to our brains.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   And I think he has a fascinating chapter in there about how, in electronic media,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   when we have these built-in distractions, hyperlinks, ads running down the side of the page,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   a million things on a page to look at and click on,
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   those distractions become actually addictive to our brain.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   And in fact, there are studies that show that actually starts to rewire our brains,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   so that our brains prefer the distractions and like to keep clicking on new things
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   rather than stick with a long piece of text, reading it, absorbing it, understanding it in a deeper way.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   And I think, you know, cross-references down the middle column of a Bible,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   they're kind of an early version of a built-in distraction system.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   They tell us that if we jump around the Bible, looking at this verse and that verse,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   not necessarily stopping to take the time to read each of those references in its own context.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   What kind of book am I looking at? Is this poetry? Is it a letter? Is it a narrative?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   And what's the context of what's happening in that book?
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   I think the danger of a cross-reference system is that it becomes a kind of an out-of-context distraction system
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   that tells us this is serious study of the Bible,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   when actually it can easily become a superficial kind of study of the Bible,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   unless I stop to do the due diligence of making sure every reference that I'm looking up is read in its own context,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   which of course is a time commitment. It's a commitment to read the Bible a particular way.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   The danger is, I think I'm really getting significant Bible study, topical study, these sorts of things,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   but there's a clear danger. And again, I'd say the first and the primary and the most natural thing to do with the Bible
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   is to read individual books at length in their own terms.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   So understanding the kind of literature it is, who was the author, who were they writing to, what was the issue, those kinds of things.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   One of my first Bibles was a Thompson's chain reference Bible.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   You would pick a topic and then bounce from Genesis to Revelation verse by verse thematically.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   I'm having flashbacks of that right now, but you're exactly right.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   Biblical cross references are like a pre-digital hypertext, really.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   You ask this question in the book, I think it's so important, I want you to address it now.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   You say this, "Which of the following is the Bible most like?
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   A. Bartlett's familiar quotations, B. The Reader's Digest Guide to Home Repairs,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   or C. The collected papers of the American Anti-Slavery Society." Great question.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   These are illustrations, of course, not exact representations.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   So what is more close to the right answer and what do the other two options imply?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   Right. We want to believe, and many times we're presented with a Bible that's either A or B.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   That is, it's either a collection of familiar quotations, so we see the usual suspects,
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Philippians 4.10, Jeremiah 29.11, Joshua 1.9, all these verses that get regularly shared as the most encouraging, most uplifting collection.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   It presents the idea, and social media I think has just made this problem kind of even stronger, it's heightened it,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   that the Bible just is a collection of these little gems, these precious one-liners,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   that just do amazing work to encourage us and strengthen us and so forth.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   So there's that, and the problem is that answer says, well, the Bible is meant to be used in a way that
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   you can look past all those verses that don't fit this model and find the good ones.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   Now, we never really stop to ask, why are these good ones buried in all this other text,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   and what do we need that text for? If we're not using it for our daily encouragement,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   I don't really need the other text. And so it narrows the Bible down into these really tremendous bite-sized pieces that we love,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   but it ignores the rest of the text. So it misrepresents what the Bible actually is,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   and has just become the way that we're familiar with using the Bible.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   The second answer, B, the Reader's Digest Guide to Home Repairs, again,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   says that the book was designed to be a kind of a self-help book. That what I do is I think of a topic,
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   marriage, for instance, and I look up all the verses, all the passages that are about marriage,
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   and I think that by adding them together, I can get the Bible's teaching about marriage.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   Problem is that that kind of work isn't contextualized. It doesn't say, well, the marriage of the patriarchs
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   was set in a certain cultural setting, and it operated a certain way in ways that we don't do,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   things that we don't do anymore, ways that we don't operate, and had assumptions that we don't work with anymore.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   So you can't just look up the marriage of, say, Jacob, and say that's a model or something for what God's intention is for marriage in every respect.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   It isn't. And through the story of the Bible, God's teaching about marriage moves forward into more light, I would say,
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   which is this key point that I really learned from Gerhardus Voss, who was a professor of biblical theology at Princeton
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   back in the day, and really did tremendous work on helping us read the Bible well as a revelation that gets more clear
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   as it moves toward Christ and towards God's ultimate intentions for human flourishing.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   So really, we need to end up with C, the collected papers of the American Anti-Slavery Society.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   That is, the Bible is a collection of different kinds of writings, each of which exists in its own context,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   its own literary form, and they have to be taken as this kind of a collection.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   It's true that the collection of the Bible comes together to tell this amazing, redemptive, restorative narrative of what Jesus the Messiah has done,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   but the books themselves are the core units. The Bible is the collection of those things.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   It's not a collection of verses. It's not a collection of little how-to passages.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   Again, it's a matter of receiving the Bible on its own terms, receiving the Bible in the form that God actually chose to give it to us.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   That, I think, is something that our modern format tempts us to move away from.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   Yeah, it certainly does, and the market seems to push these "scripture McNuggets," a phrase you use in your book,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   these isolated verses applied to a situation of life, not a horrible habit in itself,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   but certainly not a sufficient method for understanding the sweep of those books.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   You write this, quote, "In an atmosphere where consumer choice is the bottom line,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   the pressure is overwhelming on Bible providers to shape the Bible to these market-driven expectations.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   The core proposal is that these and similar tools will help you quickly find the small pieces of the Bible that seem to speak directly and meaningfully
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   to you individually, without having to bother with who these words were first written to and what they might have meant then."
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Where do you see this, and what types of things illustrate this market trend in your mind?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   Yeah, it's interesting. My own experience, nearly three decades in Bible publishing, in a non-profit setting, yes,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   but we also know what it's like to have market pressure.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   Donors, and when I was selling Bibles in a non-profit atmosphere, there were still demands that I felt as the publisher to make the Bible a certain kind of thing.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   We always would introduce helps into our Bibles.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   This introductory material, the front and the back of New Testament, Gospels of John, Bibles,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   our material is mostly used for low-cost outreach and evangelism, but I felt that pressure.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   When we met with a partner, and we're producing a specialty New Testament, one of these niche products for a certain kind of target audience,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   you know, think of the whole list of the kind of Bibles that you see these days.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   When I met with that partner and they said, "Yeah, here are the verses that we found that are most helpful for this audience."
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   And I would say, "Well, I think the whole Scripture is helpful for this audience."
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   And we would have these discussions, and I would feel the pressure to say, "Yeah, but these people aren't readers.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   They're not big readers. So this audience, we can't expect them. It'd be great if they would read more of the Bible,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   but we can help them find these little Bible vitamins that especially speak to this situation that they're in."
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   So this desire to kind of adapt the Bible to an audience in a market sense so that people will buy a product.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   And I think, and that's a really dangerous thing because the Bible is what it is.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   And it has words of correction and teaching besides just encouragement and promises.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   And so the danger with a market-driven Bible is that the pressure is to turn the Bible into a very happy thing all the time.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   And it's hard to sell people correction, for instance, you know, depth.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   These are things that people don't necessarily want to buy. They want to be encouraged.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   Life is hard. We understand that. But the Bible has to be respected kind of for what it is.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   And so there's been a real change, I think, in how people think about the Bible with the increasing commodification of the Bible.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   Making the Bible into a commodity that has to be bought and sold will necessarily put pressure on the Bible to be a certain kind of thing.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   And we need to be really aware of that as the Church.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   The Church should be the prime caretakers of the Bible, not something like a business, in my opinion.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Because business has a goal. It's not that they're bad people. It's that businesses have to sell things.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   And there's pressure to form things in certain ways when something has to be sold.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   Whereas the Church is free to say, "This is the Word of God. This is what it proclaims. This is what it teaches."
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   We have to conform ourselves to it, not it to our consumer desires.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   Yeah, we must think of how the market demands influence our Bible design and how we engage the text as a key point.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   In your book, I sense another caution, an implicit pushback as I read it. And I think it's healthy.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   You seem to say that for a lot of us, when we say that we have confidence in God's Word,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   what we're really saying is that we have a certain amount of confidence in an edition of a study Bible that puts enough guide rails around the text
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   to protect a reader from messing up on interpretation. Is that right? Do I sense that right?
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   Yes, there is. And I think that's right. I mean, I live and work among evangelicals.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   I have for three decades now in the Bible ministry in particular, Bible publishing, Bible work.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   And it's clear that the group of evangelicals that I interact with, they have a high view of Scripture in their minds.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   And I'm not doubting the sincerity, but I think the danger is that the Scripture that we have a high view of is so often,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   I think this is a danger in particular for Protestants, because we see ourselves as the Bible people.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   We're the people who kind of brought renewal and reformation to the church in the name of the Scripture.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   This is what the Scriptures actually say. But over time, any group, I would say, can build up kind of its own tradition.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   And then it's a danger for every single one of us that at some point we quit letting the text be the text.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   And we think of our notes and our guardrails as the thing that is really where the authority is.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Once back when the Christian Booksellers Association were having their annual summer gatherings of booksellers and authors,
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   those big events that would happen annually, I heard a presentation by someone doing research on Bible use.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   Saying that with the average study Bible, what was actually happening more often than people were reading the text
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   and going to the notes for explanation on the text, people were starting to jump straight to the notes
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   and not reading the text and just reading the study notes. And again, I think this is a fascinating thing.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   And again, it's a huge point in my book, is the relationship of form and content.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   Because study Bibles put the design emphasis on the call-outs, the notes, they're usually,
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   if there's going to be color on that page, it's going to be around the call-out material, not in the Bible text.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   The Bible text doesn't really receive significant design attention. So our eyes are even drawn to the notes first.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   And I think for many people, the notes then replace the text as the real source of authority.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   And I think that's the danger. So the danger with even the group that thinks of itself as having the highest view of Scripture
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   is that at some point we will say, "I'm so comfortable in my positions, I don't really have to delve into the text
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   and put things back on the table and just see what the Scriptures actually say again."
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   Anybody who spends time with the Bible is in danger, I think, of saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know this. I've read this.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   I got this one down. It's all figured out." We need to make sure we're always ready to listen to the text first
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   and put our material, which is not inspired, our thinking, which is not inspired like the original text was,
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   and say, "Hey, a real high view of Scripture says, 'Let the text be the text and always seek to let it speak to me.'"
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   Even on things where I think I might have my mind settled, you know, and it's true, you can't question everything at once.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   We have to have places where we stand, but we need to always be willing to say, "What does the Word of God say?"
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   not, "What have I always said that the Word of God says?"
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   Yeah, I think that's a wise and helpful pushback for lovers of study Bibles like me.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   So we have this TMI Bible, this Too Much Information Bible, as you call it, which is cluttered with all these things.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   When we talk about the market, we talk about "the market." How much of this is really tied to reader impatience?
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   The time commitment you mentioned earlier, we want the point fast, we want the application now.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   Therefore, our Bibles come super technical looking as a reference document.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   Right, and much of the material in my book is tied to this, what I call a modernistic paradigm.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   Information, and information at our fingertips, is a huge value in the modern world.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   We want to be able to access information. The electronic revolution has just heightened that again, so it's now on hyperdrive, this thing.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   I expect to be able to look things up. I mean, if you're presenting a talk these days, you know that there are people in the room, you know,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   who will check what you're saying immediately as you're talking to Google it, "Is this really what it says?"
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   So this expectation of instant access to information is a big deal in our culture.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   And so this idea that the Bible should be broken down into that kind of information, again, helpful in many ways.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   I love my electronic Bibles. I use it, and it's great. When I have YouVersion on my phone, my pastor's preaching,
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   I can look things up, check things, I'm doing all that. So that's great.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   But the danger is, when am I just taking that stuff away, all that information gathering, information accessing,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   overloading my brain with multiple distractions, when am I simply living deeply in the text?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   When am I reading it, just absorbing it, reading at length, so I'm getting the flow of an argument over time?
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   In one of Paul's letters, I'm seeing, you know, there are deep things in the narratives of the Old Testament,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   things that we don't pick up because we're always reading small.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   And so if we would spend time with narratives and see very intentional, like repeated phrases in stories about Samuel and Kings,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   those things are crafted very intentionally, and I fear it's just lost on modern readers
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   who have this bias toward easy, quick access to information, not dwelling in the text at a deep and slow way.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   I think the Christian church in a world that is not going to slow down anytime soon, we have to be somewhat countercultural,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   as we are in other areas. Morally, we kind of realize there's a need to be countercultural. I hope we do.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   But we need to be countercultural in ways that we live within our book.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   Even if the rest of the culture doesn't do that anymore, that needs to be something that we form Christian people into being dwellers in the book,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   not just people who access information superficially.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   That's so good. Amen. But we must end. This has been helpful, Glenn. Thank you.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I'll end by asking you about some really interesting trends. In opposition to all of this, in recent years,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   there are some really good options for readers who want a clean Bible.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   Bibliotheca went viral as one example. The ESV Reader's Bible is my choice.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   And the NIV Books of the Bible functions similarly.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   I remember when the ESV Reader's Bible launched last year, I used it to read the book of Ezekiel in one setting,
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   and it was like nothing I've ever experienced before.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Waves of powerful metaphors and images and no temptation to stop and parse every phrase,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   just to let those metaphors wash over me. How do you explain to people the experience of reading a decluttered Bible?
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   It's very interesting you bring up this question. I've had people push back when I'm giving presentations on this topic,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   saying, "Yes, my Bible is busy." As you say, there's a lot of stuff going on on that page.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   But of course, I can read right past that, and it doesn't really hinder my reading at all.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   And then I hand them one of these new Reader's Editions, which I think I've become the biggest purchaser of these Bibles
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   because I hand them out to everyone saying, "Yeah, you have a Bible, but you have a modern reference of Bible.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   You need a Reader's Edition because that's what we are doing with the Bible these days,
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   and this is the thing that we have to recover."
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   Then they read it, and they say, "Wow, that really is a different experience. It changes.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   I don't get to a chapter number, no stop signs. I keep reading.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   I read in the natural sections when the story takes a break. Maybe that's where I take a break or it changes.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   But I don't have these artificial markers telling me that this is an intentional unit,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   and this is meant to be taken just on its own out of the context of this bigger writing."
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   So I'm really excited to see Bible publishers embracing this new kind of reading.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   And I hope that all of them will do that with all of the translations that we have available to us these days,
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   because it's just good for the Bible. It's good for the church that people have a form of the Bible
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   that lets them see the Bible in something closer to its original form,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   rather than the reference book format that everybody has at this point in time.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   So I hope they do well for these publishers. I'm glad to see these things taking off.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   The Bibliotheca thing was amazing. To think that many people who wanted to get a four-multi-volume Bible
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   in this clean format, in a well-crafted book.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   This is the things we need to start bringing back to our Bibles. Instead of having such utilitarian Bibles,
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   I think books that are actually crafted to honor the Scriptures as the gift from God that they are,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   that will invite people into reading. I mean, it's hard enough to get people to read these days,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   but give them a difficult format? What chances do we have of getting people to read Bibles that are hard to read?
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   And so this new category, I hope it grows. I hope it becomes normal, becomes the new normal,
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   so that one day soon, anybody who has a Bible will say, "Yeah, I have a reader's Bible,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   and maybe I have a reference Bible too, or maybe that's just what I have as a setting on my electronic Bible."
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   So sometimes I need to reference the Bible. But my main thing with the Bible is to be always reading it.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   I'm reading it holistically. I'm feasting on the Bible. I'm not snacking on the Bible anymore.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   That was Glenn Powell, the Executive Director of the Biblica Institute for Bible Reading,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   a think tank dedicated to studying trends in Bible reading and design.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   He's also the author of the new book, "Saving the Bible from Ourselves, Learning to Read and Live the Bible Well."
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   Also be sure to check out the simplified Bible projects I mentioned in this podcast if you don't own one.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   Bibliotheca went viral as one example, but the ESV Reader's Bible is my choice.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   The one-volume edition is the one I use, and the six-volume set is coming out in the fall.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   It looks very appealing. I can't wait to see that.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   And of course, the NIV Books of the Bible project is in the mix too as another option.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   Well, thank you for listening to this weekend conversation.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   We return on Monday, and I put John Piper back on the hot seat,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   answering your tough Bible theology and ethics questions.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening, and have a great weekend.
