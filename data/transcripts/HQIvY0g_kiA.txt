[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   You can go to India, have people pushing paper straws on you, and yet the streets are still
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.120]   totally covered in trash. The pushing the paper straws probably actually distracts people from
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.800]   the much more serious problem of horrible trash. Again, I don't know enough about India to speak
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.280]   with any confidence here, but if you go and learn radical feminism in Western universities,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.440]   come back to India and start complaining about how we need to have more female CEOs
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   in a country where you have millions of female infanticides per year, I think it probably is
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.160]   like the paper straws problem, where you are so focused on a trivial problem that maybe is not
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.680]   even a problem at all. At the same time, that anger blinds you to an actual really serious
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200]   problem that's going on.
