[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   If you think about who are the strategic leaders of World War II, they're the conscripts of
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040]   World War I.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.320]   Think about people slightly younger than you, maybe your age as well.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.120]   If they survive to come off that front, then they come back and they want to start families.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   It's the Great Depression.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.420]   It's terribly difficult.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.560]   And then when they get to the age where they're going to be strategic leaders, they have the
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.220]   horror of sending their own children in.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.900]   And so they thought deeply about what had gone wrong in World War I.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.740]   This is in the West, particularly Britain and the United States.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.800]   And their answer was institution building on a massive scale and integrating.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.840]   It is all elements of national power.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.300]   This is when you've had the National Security Act passed in the United States, setting up
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.620]   all kinds of organizations, et cetera, National Security Council, among other things.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.080]   And then you're setting up the United Nations, NATO, all manner of things that that's a lot
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.940]   of it is coming off of World War I, the horrific war, and then doing a better job in World
