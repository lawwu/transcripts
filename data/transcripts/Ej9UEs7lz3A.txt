[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Most people assume that they don't own a company
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.620]   so they can't have a business card.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.760]   Business cards are pretty lucrative.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.120]   Like there are a lot of great cards with great earning
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.840]   and really great welcome bonuses
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320]   and even welcome bonuses with really low annual fees
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.620]   or no annual fees.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.360]   And the qualification for a business card
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   does not mean you own a profitable business.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.960]   It could mean you have any type of business income
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.080]   or a business plan or, you know,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.420]   let's say you have a blog that you're looking to start
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.560]   in the future and it might become a business.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.940]   Let's say you've done some consulting.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.000]   You've sold something on eBay, you know, Etsy store.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   Like if you do anything
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.680]   that could be considered business activity
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.480]   that's not working for an employer,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.960]   I think business cards are pretty lucrative.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040]   And if you go to our website and click on cards at the top,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.400]   there's a list of all the card offers
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   and the best card offers are often business card offers.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   So something to consider.
