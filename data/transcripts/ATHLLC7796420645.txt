[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.680]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.340]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.180]   I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.000]   and I've been tracking my spending for years,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   trying to optimize my expenses in every category
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.380]   to save money without having to make big sacrifices.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.200]   So I am so excited to share everything I've learned,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.860]   including the best software to make this process easy,
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.740]   how to set everything up and avoid some common pitfalls,
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.700]   as well as all my tips and tactics for saving money
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.780]   across every category of spending.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.740]   So if you wanna understand your spending,
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.300]   be more intentional about where your money goes
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780]   and ultimately save some money along the way,
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.580]   I think you'll love this episode.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.720]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.780]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.920]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.180]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.700]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.080]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.520]   and protect our personal data.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.600]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.240]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.220]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.580]   When I first looked up OurFamily,
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.780]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960]   but thankfully I started using Delete.me
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.580]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.580]   removed from the web,
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.500]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.780]   for this episode.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.660]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.240]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.580]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.380]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.220]   and get that removed as well.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.980]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites,
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.620]   and on average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.380]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.300]   When I first signed up,
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.380]   I was actually skeptical about needing a service
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.580]   on an ongoing basis,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.500]   but these data brokers are relentless,
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380]   and I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.220]   throughout the year,
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.780]   so I love having a service
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.180]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.980]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.180]   So, if you wanna get your personal information
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.420]   removed from the web,
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.300]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.700]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.740]   Okay, so first let's talk about budgeting cashflow
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.760]   and why this even is something you might wanna do.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.300]   It seems like everyone I know
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.860]   tracks their account balances to some extent,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500]   whether that's individually,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.180]   how much is in checking or savings
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.460]   or their investment accounts,
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.700]   or more often than not,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.260]   it's usually summed up to a number called net worth,
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260]   where they're tracking how much they have
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.860]   and how it's growing over time.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.980]   And a lot of people I know
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.020]   know one of those two numbers offhand.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.380]   And I'm actually gonna do an entire future episode
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.220]   on this topic,
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.780]   how you track it, project it,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.020]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.300]   I've tested a lot of the tools
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880]   to play around with those projections,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.540]   and I think it'd be really interesting.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.660]   But while a lot of people know their net worth,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.620]   I find that a lot fewer people know
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.940]   how much money they're actually spending each month,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.420]   which is so important,
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.760]   because without that number,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.700]   it's really hard to make any projection or forecast
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.980]   about how your net worth might go up or down
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.420]   every month or year.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.140]   Also, when you understand how much you're spending,
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.740]   you can be so much more intentional
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.220]   about where you spend,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.740]   and you can learn a lot and honestly save money.
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.140]   Just by seeing where we spend money and tracking things,
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.560]   I'm learning a lot and actually making changes.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.260]   So let me go back to when I first started doing this.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.020]   A long time ago, Mint launched,
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.780]   and I used it to link a few accounts
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.660]   and start tracking all my expenses,
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.820]   but very quickly, it died.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.780]   The categorization was so terrible
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.460]   that everything seemed wrong,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.040]   and it was really tedious.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.560]   About five or six years ago,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.940]   I started doing this again,
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.520]   but in a little bit of a different way.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   So at first, it was just high level.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.620]   I would make a spreadsheet for the purposes
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.460]   of trying to figure out how much our net worth
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.420]   would change each year,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420]   where I outlined all the fixed expenses
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.500]   and about how much I thought I'd be spending
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.460]   on a monthly basis on everything else,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.180]   but it wasn't that accurate.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.460]   It was good to get a sense of,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.060]   oh, maybe I'm gonna save this much,
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.180]   but I wasn't really sure
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.780]   if it was in any way, shape, or form true.
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.140]   So I went back to my old Mint account,
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.500]   and I linked some accounts,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.420]   and I started asking Amy if she could help.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.980]   And every year for two years in a row,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.440]   we would go through at the end of the year
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.340]   and try our best to categorize
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.660]   thousands of transactions all at once.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.420]   It was a painful process.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.020]   It wasn't very intentional.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.380]   And honestly, by the end, it didn't feel good at all.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.500]   So we gave up on it very quickly.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.700]   In the last couple of years,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.380]   as we've been preparing for a world with no salaries,
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.720]   starting off with me, and then ultimately Amy,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.760]   I gave it a shot again, and it got so much better.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.220]   And now that we don't have any regular salaries,
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.780]   it's even more important for us
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.480]   to understand our spending habits and our cashflow,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.500]   because we actually have to transfer money each month
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.260]   from our savings into our checking account
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.560]   so we can just pay our bills.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.140]   Now, you'll notice I haven't really
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.660]   talked about budgeting yet,
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.700]   because I prefer to think about spending tracking,
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.460]   but budgeting and spending tracking
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.740]   in some ways are really the same thing
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.320]   with a little bit of different nuance.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.620]   And if you search for spending tracking apps
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.460]   and budgeting apps, almost all of them
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.820]   will do the same thing.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.080]   But to me, it's really different.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.260]   When I think about budgeting,
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.860]   it's much more about setting an amount of money
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.620]   you wanna spend in different places
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.580]   and tracking whether you're doing it
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.620]   and making sure you're allocating all of your money
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.640]   into the right place so you can save.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.060]   Whereas spending tracking for me
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.220]   is a little bit more of a reactive approach.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.120]   I wanna see how much money I'm spending on groceries
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.020]   to decide whether I think I wanna make any changes.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.620]   It's not about saying our goal
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.660]   is to only spend $300 a month on X
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.500]   and really tracking that week to week
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.900]   to make sure we don't go over it.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.860]   That said, in the process of doing
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.020]   all of this spending tracking,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.680]   I actually think it is helpful to have a budget.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.980]   But for me, the budget is really more like a monthly
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.260]   or annual target, just so I can see
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260]   how we're trending against our expectations,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.940]   because those expectations are usually
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.440]   what I'm using to make projections about the future
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.580]   or just to kind of get a sense
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.860]   of whether we're spending more or less than we make
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.500]   or an idea of how much we'll be able to save each year
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.360]   or how much we might have to dip into our savings
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.620]   if we're spending too much.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.560]   So by having a budget, it's really more for us
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.140]   about having an expectation
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.460]   of what we think we're gonna spend
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.720]   and being able to see if we're trending
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.140]   above or below that number.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.780]   The best part about all this, by the way,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.820]   if we talk about how to even get started,
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.900]   is that once you have a system set up,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.400]   it is so much less work to maintain than you'd think.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.340]   Maybe a couple of minutes a day.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.540]   And honestly, I think if you have the right tool to do this,
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.460]   it almost feels a little bit like a game
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.560]   because every time you add more transactions,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.180]   you get more data, you get to see how you're tracking,
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.980]   and it really doesn't feel like work.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.000]   So let's talk about the tools you can use
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.180]   to make this really easy.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.740]   First off, there are probably an unlimited number of tools
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.140]   and I'm gonna miss a ton of them
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.940]   because every year, new ones crop up, old ones die.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.260]   So surely you're gonna have one that I missed
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.100]   or you're gonna have some that you find on the internet
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.140]   that I don't cover,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.560]   and it's just impossible for me to do them all.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.860]   But at the highest level,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.460]   the way almost every one of these tools works
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.740]   is by pulling in your transactions from bank accounts.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.960]   Now, yes, you could also have a budget
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.860]   by exporting all of your transactions,
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.200]   putting them into a spreadsheet, doing things manually.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.580]   That is totally possible.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.860]   That is not within the scope of this conversation,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.900]   mostly because there is no way to make that system simple
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.940]   and only take a few minutes a day or week.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.160]   And so I much prefer thinking about a system
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.020]   that's easy and simple and works in an automated basis.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.900]   So what almost all of these products are doing
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.340]   are using one of a few service providers
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.720]   that help aggregate data from your various accounts.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.260]   The most common ones are Plaid and Yodlee.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.620]   There are a few others that happen on the backend.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.380]   MX is one and there's a couple others,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.660]   but almost every consumer app I've seen
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.380]   is using Plaid or Yodlee as the primary source
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.760]   because they have some of the widest coverage
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.740]   and the best data.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.340]   Now, how this actually works
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.020]   and something important to keep in mind
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.820]   is when you log into an app and you say,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.420]   I wanna link my Chase account or my Capital One account
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.200]   or my Bank of America account,
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.660]   more often than not,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.380]   you're gonna get a screen that pops up
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.280]   and that screen's from the aggregator.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.940]   It's not from the app creator.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.860]   And you're gonna put your login and password on that screen.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.860]   Now, a couple financial institutions
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.960]   have started to adopt this thing called open banking
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.520]   where instead of actually typing in your username
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.860]   and password, you get redirected to the Chase site
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.120]   or the Capital One site.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.180]   You put in your username and password there
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.960]   and you authenticate that you're allowing Chase
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.540]   or Capital One to share your data with that app.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.900]   I love that direction,
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.560]   but with 20,000 plus financial institutions
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.860]   needing to implement that open banking technology,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.900]   it's gonna take a while.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.980]   So what's important to know
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.020]   is if an institution doesn't support that,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.060]   you're gonna type in your login and password
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.420]   into a screen that's managed by Plaid or Yodlee
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.620]   or whatever the linking provider is,
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.940]   and they're gonna go log into your bank account
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.260]   on their server and pass that information back on
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.540]   to the app in question.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.460]   And what's important about that flow
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.060]   is that the app you're using
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.620]   should never get access to any of your credentials,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.780]   your username or password.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.980]   And the company that's actually doing the aggregating
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.700]   is doing everything in a much more secure and monitored way
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.180]   than you need to rely on any of these apps to do.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.740]   I haven't had any concern using any of these apps
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.580]   in the past.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.980]   When it comes to Plaid and Yodlee,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.580]   I'm very trustworthy of what they're doing.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.740]   It's read-only.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.100]   I'm not worried about sharing my logins.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.420]   That said, I would love them all to support open banking
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.600]   and have authentication
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.480]   instead of username and password stuff,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.900]   because that's even more secure.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.060]   I will caveat one important thing.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.220]   There are a few apps I've used in the past.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.660]   I mentioned this in a past episode
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.300]   about the Max Rewards app for credit card tracking,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.500]   where the username and password fields
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.340]   were actually not on pop-ups that said Plaid or Yodlee
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.940]   and were run by the linking sites.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.860]   And for those apps, I would immediately turn away,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.460]   delete the app and not use it.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.340]   I want to be 100% sure
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.540]   that when I'm typing in my username and password
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.700]   to my banking site,
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.580]   it is on a site of a brand I trust like Plaid,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.300]   like Yodlee, like MX,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.620]   like any of the other major linking providers.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.040]   So none of the tools that I'm talking about
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.260]   are ones where I've seen a circumstance
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.860]   where they're actually trying to collect your username
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.880]   and password first and pass them on.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.100]   So I wouldn't be worried about that with these tools,
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.140]   but in any case, if you're using an app to do this,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.600]   I would definitely make sure
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.780]   that you're typing in your username and password
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.440]   on a pop-up or a modal or a page
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.700]   run by the linking aggregation sites.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.980]   Okay, so let's go to the tools that I played around with
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.020]   because the way I did this project
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.820]   and it was actually a little while ago.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.280]   So on the plus side,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.820]   I have some history of using them.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.260]   On the downside, some of it's not as fresh as I want,
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.020]   but I actually opened up an account
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.580]   with Copilot, Monarch Money.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.300]   I already had one with Mint, Rocket Money,
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.660]   Tiller HQ and YNAB.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.580]   And I went through the entire process
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.220]   of syncing 2022 transactions across all my accounts,
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.800]   categorizing them and looking at the reports.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.520]   And since then, I've also, in the past week,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.060]   gone in and done the same thing for Simplify,
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.360]   which is a product from Quicken.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.720]   So I went through the process for all of these tools
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   and played with all of them, categorized everything.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.640]   And so I wanna be clear that this is not everything.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   Ultimately, I ended up picking Copilot
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.920]   as the tool I thought was the best for me.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.320]   And after becoming such a huge fan of the product,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.040]   I probably used it six to 12 months at the time,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.280]   I reached out to the team and said,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.160]   "Hey guys, I really love your product.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.840]   I don't wanna talk about any other personal finance products
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   when it comes to spending tracking.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.640]   And could we work together?"
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.360]   Fortunately, after some back and forth,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.840]   we found a way to make that work.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.720]   They are now a sponsor of the show.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.040]   However, they did not ask me to make this episode.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.080]   They don't even know I'm making this episode.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.200]   They're not paying me to produce this episode.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.580]   Everything in this episode is purely my own opinions.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.560]   I was gonna make this episode
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.080]   whether they were a sponsor or not.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.120]   But fortunately, I'm super excited to have them as a sponsor
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.580]   because I love the product.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.240]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/copilot,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.680]   you can get two months free.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.880]   And throughout this episode,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.400]   because as I mentioned in the intro,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.020]   it's not just about how to track all of this.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.120]   I wanna go through every single category
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.240]   where we spend money
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.080]   and talk about all the different things
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.040]   that we've thought about
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.440]   and some of the hacks and processes and tools we use
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.280]   to try to bring down our cost
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.080]   without making a lot of sacrifices.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.240]   And that's gonna be a lot of this conversation.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.140]   Hopefully you'll be able to use a lot of those tips
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.340]   to save money yourself.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.400]   Within that process,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.840]   I actually do talk about some other brands
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.480]   that I work with in the show
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   and plenty of brands that I don't.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.640]   And I just wanna be clear again
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.040]   that none of the brands that I'm partnering with in the show
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.200]   know that I'm even mentioning them in this episode,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.040]   have paid me to mention this episode.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.240]   I do have sponsors.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.840]   Those sponsors do pay
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.820]   for the advertisements you hear on the show.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.420]   I introduce all of them with a little whoosh sound
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.600]   and you can kind of tell that there's a sponsor coming in.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.080]   I talk about how excited I am
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.840]   to have them partnering with the podcast.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.200]   But throughout the rest of this episode,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.880]   you will hear me talk about some brands that I love.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.040]   And to the extent those brands have offers
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.000]   or deals for listeners, I'm gonna mention those.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.400]   And I just thought it was good to be fully transparent
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.360]   that some of those brands are sponsors.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.240]   Some of those links might not be sponsors.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.940]   They might be my personal referral links,
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.500]   but none of them have paid to be here.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.240]   And I've tried my best to only talk about the products
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.440]   and services that I've evaluated or that I think are great,
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.240]   which fortunately is exactly how I think about sponsors.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.680]   Whenever I find a product I love that I wanna talk about,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   I reach out to them and say, can we work together?
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.000]   Because I really wanna only work with brands
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.940]   with products I love.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.120]   So with that aside, let's talk about some of these tools.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.760]   And again, I've used most of them for hours at a time
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.280]   going through all of these products,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.980]   trying to decide what makes sense.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.060]   There is nothing better than finding a brand of clothing
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.680]   that's comfortable, functional, and looks good.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.280]   And that's exactly how I feel
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.400]   about our sponsor today, Viori.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.600]   If you saw me in person, you'd know I believe it
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.560]   because there are very few days that go by
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.920]   where I'm not wearing one, two,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.000]   or even three pieces of Viori.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.400]   They make performance apparel for men and women
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.080]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.800]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.080]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.400]   And it is so comfortable,
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.160]   you'll wanna wear it all the time.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.400]   I've long said that Sunday performance joggers
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.160]   were my favorites and don't get me wrong,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.720]   I have at least three pairs
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.940]   and they are the most comfortable pants I've owned,
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.280]   but I've been running a lot more
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.020]   and it's still warm in California.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.920]   So I'm wearing my core shorts all the time.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.760]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.820]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.040]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.600]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.080]   and running around town.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.840]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.160]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.720]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.920]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.940]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.360]   at allthehacks.com/viori.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.760]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.660]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.240]   Signing your life away to a big wireless provider
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.800]   is kind of like being trapped on a roller coaster from hell.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.400]   Sure, it looked fun at first,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.120]   they probably threw in the free phone,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.340]   but now you can't get off.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.760]   Month after month of insane bills and unexpected thrills,
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.960]   like overages and surprise fees.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   If that sounds like your big wireless plan,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.360]   it is time to get off the ride with Mint Mobile,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.800]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.040]   For a limited time, wireless plans for Mint Mobile
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.100]   are just $15 a month.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.520]   That's unlimited talk, text, and data for just $15 a month.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.640]   I know because we just switched a line over
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.380]   so our au pair could get unlimited talk, text,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.740]   and high-speed data delivered
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.920]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.880]   And also so we could save hundreds of dollars a year.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.520]   Seriously, we're gonna save so much
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.640]   without really sacrificing anything.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.320]   You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.360]   and bring your phone number
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.560]   along with all your existing contacts.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.240]   So ditch your big wireless carrier
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.960]   with Mint Mobile's limited time deal
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.520]   and get premium wireless service for just 15 bucks a month.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.480]   To get your new unlimited wireless plan
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.840]   for just 15 bucks a month
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.400]   and get the plan shipped to your door for free,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.800]   go to allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.240]   That's allthehacks.com/mintmobile, M-I-N-T, mobile,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.560]   and cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.760]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.640]   As I said, I loved Copilot.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.960]   It's what I use every day.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.200]   It's how Amy and I get on the same page about spending.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.080]   However, it's not a free app and it's only on iOS and Mac.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.600]   So I totally get that it's not gonna be a perfect option
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.560]   for everyone.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.760]   For some of you, you'd rather use a free app
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.520]   and there are options.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.120]   And for some of you, you have Android
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.920]   and you don't have an iOS or Mac and that won't work.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.960]   So like I said, to test all of these products,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   I went through and I spent hours with each of them
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.600]   trying to figure out what worked.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.520]   And it was really hard not to want to put Copilot ahead.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.960]   From a speed standpoint, from a design standpoint,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.480]   from a functionality standpoint,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   from the automatic categorization standpoint,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.880]   you'll hear me talk about a lot of features of these tools
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   that I really like.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.760]   And a lot of them are features that I love about Copilot
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.040]   because that's what I'm using.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.120]   However, it's not a free product.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.320]   If you want a free product, you can use Mint,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.560]   you can use Rocket Money.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.200]   I think they have a lot of limitations.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.880]   Mint is filled with ads and not as customizable
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.800]   as you'd want.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.080]   Rocket Money was a past partner of the show
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.720]   because I actually love the product
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.240]   for canceling subscriptions and making it super easy
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.920]   to automate that process and negotiate your bills.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.480]   But when it comes to the spending and savings tracking,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.960]   I think it's a little slow.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.640]   I don't think it works as well on the web as I'd want it to,
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.560]   but it is a free product if you want something free.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.760]   But if you're willing to pay
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.360]   and you don't have an iOS or Mac on Android,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   you could use something like Monarch Money
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.120]   or Simplify is an interesting one
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   because when I was prepping for this episode,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.360]   I was doing a little bit of research
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.400]   and I wanted to see if someone had done some similar content.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.040]   Turns out Wirecutter did a whole post
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.360]   on the best expense tracking and budgeting apps.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.640]   And they came to Simplify as the number one.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.800]   However, when I went to the competition section
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.760]   and looked at all the products they used,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   they left off so many options
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.040]   that it's really hard for me
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.440]   to take their recommendation too seriously.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.400]   In fact, they didn't even include Copilot, Monarch,
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.160]   Rocket Money, and a handful of other popular tools
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.720]   in the evaluation.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   So I wouldn't trust that review too much
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.640]   until it gets updated.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.160]   But the fact that Simplify came out ahead
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.200]   and I didn't include it
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.960]   when I went through this whole process earlier this year
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.480]   made me think maybe I should go back and give it a look.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.880]   And after that process,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.680]   I am totally confused how it became number one.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.480]   I went in and tried to use the product,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.000]   I linked all my accounts,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.640]   and there were so many things that didn't make sense to me.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   First off, you go in and categorize all your transactions,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.120]   but those categories don't actually get linked
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   to any budget or tracking ability that I could find
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.120]   until you created a separate spending plan,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.720]   which you had to one-by-one re-add
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.800]   all of your transactions in,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.760]   and then everything else fell into another category.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.720]   You couldn't look at categories and subcategories together.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.480]   You had to pick one.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.120]   I didn't think the design was great,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.800]   but I thought maybe I just don't get it.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.760]   Maybe I was not using it right.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.840]   So I searched on YouTube for a video
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.280]   of someone else using it
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   to try to see if there was someone out there
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.320]   who is a diehard fan
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.000]   to see if they could explain why it was so awesome.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   I literally only found one or two videos
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.120]   that wasn't produced by Quicken itself.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.320]   And for both of them,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.040]   I think they did a pretty bad job of selling it.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.880]   And one of them,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.920]   which actually looked like it had the most promise,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.120]   it was someone reviewing their actual spending
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.720]   so there was real data in there.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.560]   It seemed like multiple times,
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.000]   the woman reviewing it had to go and fix something
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.920]   or correct something 'cause it wasn't working
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.400]   or was a bit confused.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.760]   So I don't know.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.840]   I couldn't figure out why this was the number one tool.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.160]   Does it do the job?
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.120]   Probably.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.360]   Does it make sense to me?
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.040]   Was it simple and easy to use?
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.000]   Not at all.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.680]   So I might be missing something,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.080]   but I didn't get that recommendation at all.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.760]   Now, if you're hearing all that and wondering,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.120]   where is YNAB?
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.960]   Don't worry.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.240]   I didn't leave it off completely.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.800]   I have tested out YNAB multiple times.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.560]   The main difference between YNAB
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.880]   and why ultimately for me it's not the right tool
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.160]   is that they really focus
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.040]   on what's called zero balance budgeting.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.440]   YNAB calls it giving every dollar a job.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   Now what that means is every bit of income coming in
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.480]   needs to be assigned somewhere
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.440]   so that you can know where all of your money is going.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.560]   For me, that's not what I'm trying to do here.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.040]   I'm not trying to make sure
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.120]   that everything is going to the right place,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   including savings and all that.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.600]   I'm really just trying to understand
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.400]   how much money I'm spending.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.080]   And so that actually is not the process I wanted to follow.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.320]   Even more so now that we don't have income
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.920]   from a regular job,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.720]   we don't actually have dollars to give jobs to.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.280]   So zero balance budgeting is definitely something
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.720]   that I think can be really valuable for people
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.240]   who are just starting to learn how to save and budget
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.840]   and want to figure out how to allocate that savings,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.120]   who need to get a better grasp of applying money
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.360]   towards debt pay down or future goals
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.080]   or building their emergency fund,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.720]   or just people that like that form of budgeting
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.240]   where you're actually making sure you know
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.800]   where every single dollar is and you can account for it.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   I definitely think YNAB is a great tool.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.840]   You can even get a 34-day free trial
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.440]   at allthehacks.com/ynab.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.800]   And you can listen to episode 16
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.120]   where I had Jesse Meacham,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.440]   the founder of YNAB on the show,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.000]   to give his perspective on budgets and budgeting,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.560]   which I think will give a different perspective
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.400]   than I have.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.720]   So if you wanna go back and listen to that,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.160]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.120]   But at the end of the day,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.360]   for the purposes of what I wanted to do
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.600]   and what I thought made the most sense for us,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.400]   which was tracking our spending
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   and understanding all the categories
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.440]   that money gets spent on,
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.720]   Copilot was the tool that I thought made the most sense.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   That said, a lot of what you need to do
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.160]   to get these tools all set up is the same.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.400]   So I'm gonna talk about that.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.000]   And it's a process that will apply
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.320]   to almost any tool you're using.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.440]   So the first part of that process is setting up categories.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.480]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   the main action you're gonna take that takes time
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.960]   is just making sure all of your expenses
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.040]   are tied to a specific category
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.920]   so you can do some analysis later.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.960]   And I'm actually gonna run through all the categories I use.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.440]   Almost every one of these tools, by the way,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.600]   will give you a set of default categories.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.800]   And you can choose to use them, modify them,
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.880]   use some of them.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.560]   There's plenty of options.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.760]   I think there's a few things
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.320]   that are important to understand.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.440]   One, at the end of the day,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.200]   the level of granularity you need is really up to you.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.520]   For us, we don't need to know the difference
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.920]   between coffee shops, bars, restaurants,
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.760]   fast food, and everything else.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   We just generally wanna know
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.640]   how much we spend going out to eat.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.680]   Also, you could decide you wanna go in
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   and categorize all the shopping you do into every category,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.000]   or you can just put it all into shopping.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.080]   So that's a personal decision.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.960]   I think a really important thing to keep in mind
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.160]   is you wanna get directionally important.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.000]   You can always drill down.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.160]   If you put everything in food and you realize it's too much,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.360]   you can look into food and look at all the expenses.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.160]   You can recategorize them later.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.680]   So I would err on the side
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.120]   of not making it too much work up front
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.240]   and deciding later if you need more.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.960]   Though I'm sure there's someone listening
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.600]   that would say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's so much harder."
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.720]   If you have more categories up front
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.960]   and you wanna reassign them, it's much easier.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.840]   So I'll leave it to you to decide what you want.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.040]   But here are the categories and subcategories
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.520]   we ended up using.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.880]   And I'll talk a little bit about what they are.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.760]   First off, I'll do all the categories first,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.880]   and then I'll break each one down into subcategories
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.520]   so you can kind of get a sense of this.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.240]   I'll probably see if there's an easy way
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.440]   to put this in the show notes
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.320]   because it's probably not the easiest thing
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.840]   for you to just sit down and write down.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.760]   But we break everything up into household,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.880]   car and transport, children, health and wellness,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.600]   lifestyle, food and drink, shopping, gifts and donations,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.880]   fees, and two others which are actually hidden categories
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.720]   for credit card payments and work expenses,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   which I'll come back to.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.440]   Within household, we break things into home loans,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.600]   but obviously if you rent, you'd have rent.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.200]   Dog, could be other pets.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.600]   Insurance, bills and expenses,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.160]   which is things like phone, cable, internet.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.040]   Home, which is things like furniture,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.960]   cleaning supplies, utilities, and property taxes.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.560]   We have car and transport, makes sense.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.720]   For car, it's our monthly payments,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.000]   it's any maintenance and service costs.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.240]   And then transportation is things like taxis,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.600]   train cards, Lyft rides, Ubers, et cetera.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.640]   Within children, we've got childcare,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.280]   children and education.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.480]   I think childcare makes sense, that's our au pair.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.560]   Children is all of the miscellaneous expenses
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.720]   that you buy for kids,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.600]   which seems like a very big part of our budget right now.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.680]   And also one that I think was really helpful
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.160]   to get an understanding of how much it is
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.960]   because it's something that you're kind of
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.200]   always adding little purchases to.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.360]   And I never really had a good sense of what we're spending.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.760]   And then education, which is cost for preschool right now,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.480]   but in the future could include tutors
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.880]   and courses and anything like that.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.400]   In health and wellness, we have fitness,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.480]   healthcare and personal care.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.160]   I think those all kind of make sense.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.960]   Personal care, meaning things like haircuts
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.480]   or if one of us were to get a massage or a manicure
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.360]   or something like that.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.240]   In lifestyle, I have subscriptions,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.640]   entertainment, personal and travel.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.880]   Subscriptions is things like Spotify or Netflix.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.000]   Entertainment is stuff like if we buy tickets
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.120]   or go to a zoo or a museum,
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.680]   or Amy and I wanna do an escape room.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.240]   Personal is actually a category that I created
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   for all of the things that you might spend money on
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.120]   that don't fall into other categories
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.560]   that are personal to you.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.480]   But it turns out there aren't that many expenses there.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.440]   I don't even think we had one last year.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.400]   So I don't know if you really need it,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.680]   but if someone wanted to buy a nice handbag,
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.400]   maybe you don't wanna call that clothing
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.040]   and you could put it in personal.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.800]   And then travel is a bucket for all of our travel.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.720]   Food and drink, that's where we have only two categories.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.640]   Groceries and dining and drinks,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.360]   which like I mentioned earlier, encompasses everything.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.400]   Within shopping, we really just have shops and clothing.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.600]   I know some people wanna go in
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.320]   and break down all their expenses,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.040]   but for us, shops is basically Target
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.320]   and a few other transactions.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.880]   In gifts and donations, we have gifts,
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.480]   which is birthday gifts, Christmas gifts,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.400]   all those kinds of things.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.880]   And then donations is any money we contribute to charity,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.520]   which mostly for us is just contributions
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.600]   to our Daffy account.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.520]   I'll come back to that.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.760]   Last is fees.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.680]   This is an interesting one
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.320]   because we have a lot of credit cards with annual fees.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.920]   This one actually is not insignificant,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.760]   but anytime I get credits back on a credit card
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.320]   for purchases, I also throw them into fees
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.680]   if they are credits for things
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.200]   I would have normally already spent money on.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.480]   So that's important because for example,
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.000]   with a Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.720]   the $300 travel credits,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.800]   I was gonna spend money on travel anyways.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.120]   So I categorize those credits in fees
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.320]   to help offset the actual costs of those fees.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.480]   So for example, we have a subscription to SiriusXM.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   I rarely use it, but we have it on one of our cars.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.320]   It's free because Amex has an entertainment credit.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.280]   So when the Sirius charge comes in,
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.600]   it's all auto-categorized as entertainment,
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.840]   but the credit from Amex for that charge,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   that digital entertainment credit,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.440]   I categorize that credit as entertainment
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.240]   because it's not fair to offset the fees with that credit
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.960]   because I wouldn't otherwise pay for Sirius.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.520]   So a little confusing,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.520]   but if I'm getting credits from credit cards
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.120]   that aren't things that I would have paid for,
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.600]   I just categorize them into the fees category.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.200]   Have another category called other,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.920]   which is where if I don't know where something goes,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.960]   I put it into other.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.600]   However, we don't really have anything here,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.800]   and if we ever found a transaction in other,
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   it would probably more be a signal
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.320]   that we need to create a new category
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.840]   than that we would keep using it.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.960]   Finally, I mentioned the last two categories,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.160]   and I guess there's a third.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.520]   So one is credit card payments.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.600]   I generally want a sense of how much money
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.800]   we're spending on our credit cards each month,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.680]   just so I can kind of understand at a very high level
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.440]   what are our monthly credit card bills
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   because I need to make sure
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   there's enough money to pay them, et cetera.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.240]   So I have a hidden category in Copilot
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.720]   called credit card payments
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.760]   because all of the transactions on those credit cards
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.640]   are getting categorized as expenses,
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.040]   I don't wanna duplicate the credit card payments
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.240]   as transactions.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.840]   So I have it as a hidden category
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.760]   that doesn't show up in our budgeting,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.560]   but that I can look at if I wanna see
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.960]   how much am I spending each month
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.600]   on credit cards in general,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.200]   which is actually really helpful
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.120]   just to get a sense of how many points
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.960]   did I earn last year?
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.240]   How much did I put on credit cards?
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   What was my average point earning?
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.160]   And then I have work expenses,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.560]   which is another hidden category
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.500]   because any of those expenses
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.400]   that are related to the podcast, related to business,
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.840]   I wanna make sure I separate
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.720]   and don't count in our regular budget
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.920]   because I probably wouldn't have spent them
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.160]   if I didn't have a business that makes some money.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.520]   And so those are all hidden as well.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.920]   I'm trying to put all of my work expenses on a work card
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.200]   that I don't actually integrate into Copilot at all.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   And the only challenge there is every now and then
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.500]   there's a purchase like a flight
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.960]   where I just really wanna earn five points per dollar
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.360]   more than I want to have those separate.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.280]   And so there's just a handful of work expenses a year
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.840]   that I put on a personal card
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.120]   because usually there was a lot more points to be earned.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.680]   And so I wanna hide those from the budget.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   Finally, there's a category that's a non-category
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.240]   that's just excluded,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.960]   which I use for things that don't really matter
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.600]   or don't make sense or don't fit into any of these.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.760]   On Copilot at least there's a whole separate thing
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.000]   where you can categorize something
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.560]   as an internal transfer or income.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.960]   And so if you didn't hear any of those things
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.000]   that's because I put income and income.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.600]   And if I'm transferring money between accounts
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.080]   that's an internal transfer.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.380]   So those are all the categories.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.600]   And with each category,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.480]   there are budgets associated with them.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.640]   Almost all of these tools
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   will help you automatically do those budgets
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.480]   based on your prior spending
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.880]   and then you can tweak them from there,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.080]   which is how we did it.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.100]   One of the tricky things here
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.600]   is that almost every piece of software
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.680]   goes in and looks at budgets on a monthly basis,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.120]   which is great except for some cases like property tax
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.780]   where we pay it twice a year.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.280]   So some apps, Copilot being one of them,
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.360]   let you go in and set different budgets for each month.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.720]   So you could say my property tax budget is $0 a month,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.120]   but in the two months a year
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.920]   that we have to pay property tax,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.880]   it's whatever that amount is.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.000]   So that's how I've set it up for property tax.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.200]   And it's smart enough
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.840]   that it kind of forecasts into the future
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.040]   that it's gonna be the same months every year.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   And it also looks at your past transactions
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.920]   to know when it is.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.580]   So it's pretty smart like that.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.640]   That's how I do some things that are annual.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.000]   The other alternative or compliment
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.220]   is using what's called carryover budgets.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.020]   So if you enable this on Copilot,
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.240]   you can take a budget
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.760]   and any money that's not spent
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.480]   will roll over to the next month.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.360]   And this works really well on travel
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.500]   and any other category
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.920]   where you really probably have an annual budget.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.580]   So it's not as much monthly,
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.280]   but the transactions happen across the year
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.780]   different times of the year.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.600]   So let's say you wanna spend $6,000 a year on travel.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.960]   You can create a $500 a month travel budget
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   with carryover
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.560]   so that each month you don't spend all $500.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.760]   It just rolls over to the next month.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.340]   And so at the end of the year,
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.920]   that should all balance out.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.280]   It also supports negative.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.200]   So if you take your vacation in March,
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.080]   you'll just be negative
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.740]   and slowly get back to zero by the end of the year.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.260]   And you can go in when you enable carryover budgets.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.380]   You can actually say only on these categories
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.620]   or not on these categories.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.260]   So you're not having every category carryover.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.580]   So that's how we solve some of the variability each month.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.380]   Next, almost every one of these apps
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.140]   has something to track recurring expenses.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.440]   The good apps almost all automate this.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.860]   They look at your past transactions.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.900]   They identify what things happen every month
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   and they create a recurring expense.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.940]   They identify whether it's monthly,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.240]   every other week, every two, three months, every year,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.880]   and they create a separate place in the app for it,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.520]   which is super helpful.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.660]   So I can go somewhere and see
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.400]   what are all my recurring expenses,
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.680]   which is great 'cause you can identify
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.320]   ones you wanna get rid of.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.840]   It also is great because it tracks when things come in.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.960]   And so for an example of how this feature worked,
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.600]   I was looking in Copilot the other day.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.700]   I noticed that one of the bills I have hadn't been paid.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.280]   It looked like it was overdue.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.320]   So I was like, hmm, that's strange.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.200]   This bill's on autopay.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.080]   What happened?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.300]   So I logged into the site
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.860]   and I noticed that the credit card linked to that bill
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.860]   had expired and disabled autopay.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.860]   So I quickly added a new credit card
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.300]   and I was able to pay the bill and avoid late fees,
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.500]   all because I noticed
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.360]   when I was monitoring recurring transactions
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.740]   that one of them was supposed to come.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.940]   So I think that covers almost all of the setup
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.360]   for all of these spending tracking apps.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.900]   Each app might have its own nuance to how it works.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.820]   So I can't speak to every single one,
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.260]   but for the most part, it's setting up your categories,
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.700]   categorizing your transactions, setting up budgets,
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.660]   making sure that any recurring expenses
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.820]   are logged as recurring.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.280]   And on a regular basis,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.620]   all you need to do is go in and categorize transactions.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.460]   And then on a monthly or annual basis,
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.620]   you'll be able to go in and see how things are trending,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.860]   which is where the real, real value comes in.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.180]   Now, I mentioned that on a regular basis,
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.140]   you have to go in and categorize transactions,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.860]   but I did want to flag something that is really exciting.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.580]   So I just saw, as I'm recording this,
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.660]   the release notes from Copilot
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.780]   that they just launched something
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.460]   called Copilot Intelligence,
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.820]   which is using your data to build a model
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.220]   to automatically categorize your transactions.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.660]   The really cool thing about it
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.900]   is that each individual user
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.140]   actually gets their own private categorization model
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.740]   based on their data,
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.300]   and it's not being used on everyone else.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.920]   So they're automatically looking at your past behaviors
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.380]   to suggest the categories you want, which is really cool.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.120]   And even if they're not 100% sure on the right category,
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.580]   they're at least sorting the list
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.040]   based on the things they think are the most likely
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.360]   to be the right categories.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.300]   I'm so excited to play with this.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.140]   I already think the model they're using is one of the best
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.220]   based on me going through five or six apps and doing this,
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.740]   but if they can really build out a model
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.380]   based on just my past transaction categorization,
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.620]   I think it's really likely
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.820]   to be the best categorization tool out there.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.520]   Remember all those life insurance ads on the radio
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.580]   when you were a kid?
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.420]   Probably not,
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.460]   because that was for your parents to worry about.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.440]   Well, guess what?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.700]   Now you're the parent,
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.080]   and now's probably the time to get life insurance
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.620]   to help protect your family.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.800]   Our sponsor today, Fabric by Gerber Life,

[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.620]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.940]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive

[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.820]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.420]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.180]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.660]   being proactive about this year
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.340]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.020]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.180]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.500]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.

[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.460]   And best of all,
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.620]   you can have this transparent open communication
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.420]   with your team in whatever way works best for you.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.740]   Whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.940]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.220]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.300]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.820]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.620]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.500]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.380]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.980]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.860]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.300]   And as an All The Hacks listener,

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.580]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.540]   But next I wanna talk a little bit
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.620]   about some of the things
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.220]   that make this whole process confusing or messy
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.780]   and how I go about solving them.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.380]   So one is purchases at retailers
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.300]   that have lots of different categories assigned to them.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.560]   So let's take Target, Amazon, anything like that.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.800]   So one option is what I've done with Target,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.680]   which is I just create a category called Shops
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.240]   and I throw everything in there.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.780]   Now, we don't spend that much money at Target
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.940]   such that I think that's gonna have a big impact
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.780]   on our budget.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.940]   However, on Amazon, we do.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.420]   And also, by the way, on Target,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.700]   almost everything we're doing is in a similar category.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.500]   Whereas on Amazon, we might buy furniture,
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.020]   we might buy sporting goods,
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.540]   we might buy food and groceries,
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.420]   we might buy household goods.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.200]   So for Amazon, I really wanna make sure
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.580]   we get the categories right.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.720]   So two things.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.860]   One, there is a page on Amazon
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   that I can't believe I only just found
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.920]   where you can search for your transactions
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.660]   or you go to the account page and click on Transactions.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.540]   And instead of sorting everything by orders
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.780]   and all your orders you've had,
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.500]   it sorts everything by credit card transactions.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.940]   So you can see $37 transaction,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.660]   click here and see what it is.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.300]   So that screen is incredibly helpful.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.680]   It's also helpful for refunds,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.260]   which I'll get to in a minute.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.320]   But Copilot actually has this amazing feature
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.100]   where you can log into Amazon
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.940]   and they'll sync with your Amazon account.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.740]   And then whenever you have a purchase,
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.020]   they'll fill in straight natively within the app
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.800]   all of the purchased items
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.420]   that are associated with an order.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.880]   So you might see $73 from Amazon,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.740]   but you'll actually be able to also see
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.620]   all the items you purchased with that order
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.260]   and you'll be able to more easily categorize
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.540]   that transaction without having to go look somewhere else.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.140]   Another one like this is Venmo,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.580]   where you'll see a bunch of transactions
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.180]   on your checking account that say Venmo in, out,
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.540]   in, out, in, out.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.980]   And the way Copilot solves this
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.280]   is they set up an email forwarding system
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.800]   where you can set up a Gmail filter
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.220]   to auto forward your Venmo transaction emails
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.900]   to Copilot and only your Venmo ones.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.100]   And then they actually get data
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.660]   on what those individual transactions are.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.880]   It's especially helpful if you ever have a balance
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.800]   in your Venmo account,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.220]   because if someone sends you $100
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.580]   and you don't cash it out,
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.620]   and then you send someone else $50,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.220]   your bank account won't actually see
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.800]   any of those transactions.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.840]   So we've used that Venmo transaction to make this easier.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.020]   Another category that can be confusing is cash and ATMs.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.300]   So the way we think about this,
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.720]   if I see an ATM charge while we're traveling,
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.140]   I'll try to just pick the category that's most likely
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.120]   and be okay that it's not perfect.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.020]   If we took out money 'cause we were buying food
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.140]   while we were walking around the city, I'll call it food.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:20.980]   If we took out money
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.420]   because we knew we would need to buy bus tickets,
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.780]   I'll call it transportation.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.060]   It's not a perfect solution,
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.940]   but it's a lot easier
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.100]   than logging every individual cash transaction.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.980]   That said, we do have some cash
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.420]   that we keep around the house for various things.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.120]   And if I'm spending any meaningful amount of money,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.220]   let's call it something around $100 or more,
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.540]   I will go into Copilot after I do it
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.580]   and just add the transaction in my manual account.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.780]   You could do this on any app
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.860]   where you just add a manual transaction,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.620]   but I try to only really do it
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.260]   if I think it's enough that matters,
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.480]   because it's too complicated
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.620]   if I just have five bucks that I bought something
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.820]   at a food truck, it's too much work.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.620]   That said, as you know, I love points,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   so I'm trying to put as little as possible on cash,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.240]   but every now and then there's something that makes sense.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.020]   And when I'm doing that, I wanna log that
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.140]   so that it's in there if it's enough that matters.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.460]   So next, let's talk about refunds.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.260]   This one can be a bit of an annoying one for two reasons.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.100]   One, the misalignment of when it happens.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.900]   So the easy fix there is for Amy's birthday,
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.060]   I bought her a tennis racket, but I didn't know which size,
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.780]   so I bought two different sizes.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.020]   I bought them in one month,
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.460]   and then we returned the one
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.500]   that wasn't the right size the next month.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.220]   So it looks like I spent twice as much on gifts in one month
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.200]   and then we got it back the next month.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.500]   So I'll just go in on the return transaction
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.580]   and I'll just change the date
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.060]   to the purchase date transaction
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.820]   so that it all nets out in the same month.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.460]   And then on Amazon, it's a little bit more tricky
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.980]   because you need to go find what transaction
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.800]   the refund was associated with.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.700]   So I'll just go to that transaction screen,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.940]   look at the category,
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.220]   and just make sure I put whatever category
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.140]   the original transaction was on.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.340]   Next, let's talk about splitting
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.220]   because it's especially relevant to Amazon stuff.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.360]   If I have a transaction that's not wholly in one category
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.060]   or not entirely mine,
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.020]   let's say I bought dinner for some friends,
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.480]   there's two options to deal with that.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.620]   One, categorize the whole thing as food,
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.980]   and then if your friend Venmo's you money
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.020]   to pay you back for it,
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.700]   you can just put that deposit or credit in food as well,
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.860]   or you can just split the transaction in two
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.660]   and you can exclude half of it.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.700]   You could say dinner was $100, I'm splitting it,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.540]   $50 is food, $50 is exclude.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.300]   Or maybe you're out at dinner and half of it's a work expense
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.420]   you could say 50 to work expenses, 50 to food.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.100]   On Amazon, sometimes there are purchases
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.620]   where some of the stuff is for the house,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.820]   some of the stuff is for the kids,
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.820]   some of the stuff is for the dog.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.980]   And if it's a really, really big transaction,
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.260]   maybe on a rare case, I'll split the transaction
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.120]   so I can separately categorize it.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.440]   But for the most part, I'm just choosing the category
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.740]   that makes the most sense.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:55.300]   So if we spent $100, $75 on clothes and $25 on home,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.900]   I just call it clothes.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.620]   And I don't worry about the fact
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.380]   that there's a little bit of home purchasing
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.260]   going into the clothing category,
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.820]   it just all kind of nets out.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.660]   One other thing is maybe you have a transaction
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.700]   that's for a long period of time.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.660]   I mentioned earlier that one way to do it
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.620]   is separate budgets.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.060]   So let's take insurance payments.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.700]   A lot of car insurance, you pay every six months.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.060]   So two options.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.020]   One, you just go in and you set a car insurance budget
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.500]   where the budget is higher every six months
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.580]   and it's lower every other month.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.140]   Or you can go in and you can click on the transaction,
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.460]   split it into six and allocate it
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.420]   over each of the next six months.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.580]   It's really a personal preference how you wanna do it.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.520]   Depending on how frequent it is, how big it is,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.740]   it may or may not matter,
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.660]   or you may or may not make sense to do one or the other.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.740]   For me, I'm just thankful that USAA
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.500]   allows you to split your insurance bill
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.960]   into monthly payments without charging any fees.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.580]   So we just do that and don't worry about it for insurance.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.140]   Next, I wanna talk about one feature
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.460]   that I wish all of these apps have.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.020]   And to be fully transparent,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.760]   I've emailed Copilot and said, "Please build this feature,"
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.020]   is trying to manage cashflow.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.440]   And so I'm gonna do a whole episode actually
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.620]   on how we do this and how we take our money
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.700]   and decide where it goes and in what order
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.600]   and all the financial automation we do
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.920]   to make it all efficient.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.140]   But I really wish that one of these apps
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.740]   would look at upcoming credit card bills,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.780]   look at upcoming expenses we have,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.300]   because it knows all of our recurring expenses,
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.940]   filter out the ones on credit cards
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.260]   because we don't pay for them the moment they hit,
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   and show me over the next week or over the next month,
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.420]   here's how much money is estimated
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.220]   to be withdrawn from your checking account
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.700]   so I can make sure I have enough money in there.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.620]   Why does it matter?
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.940]   Well, because if that money is in my high-yield savings
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.540]   account or my Wealthfront Cash account,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.500]   or if it's in short-term treasuries or in treasury ETF,
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.700]   I'm earning probably around 5% on that money.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.620]   And if it's in my checking account, I'm not.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.140]   And so I wanna leave as little money
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.700]   in checking as possible.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.700]   I know that all of these apps have enough information
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.060]   to tell me how much money I need in my checking account
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.420]   on any given day,
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.740]   but it's not something that any of them have built yet.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.080]   So I can hope and cross my fingers.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.260]   When I was looking at the AI features that Copilot launched,
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.260]   they said in the future,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.200]   you'll be able to actually query your money
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.360]   and ask questions.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.500]   So maybe I'll be able to write a query that says,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   how many dollars do you think will get withdrawn
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.580]   for my checking account in the next 15 days?
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.880]   Maybe I can automate asking that question,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.940]   or maybe they will just build this feature
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.600]   because I know I've talked to them about it
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.940]   and given them a lot of ideas of what it would be.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.000]   So, like I said, I'm gonna do a whole episode
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.500]   on how we think about all of our financial automation.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.980]   It's really separate from budgeting,
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.860]   but I've put a lot of time into where does the money go?
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.700]   How does it go?
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.860]   How does it flow?
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.560]   So that like tracking our spending,
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.200]   we just don't spend that much time
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.540]   managing our money either,
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.300]   and it makes life really easy.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.980]   So before I jump into all the categories
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.020]   and how we think about saving money in them,
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.060]   I thought it might make sense
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.660]   to just jump into all the benefits of doing this
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.220]   and why it even makes sense
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.360]   to spend all this effort in the first place.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.460]   So the biggest one for me
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.820]   is that we get to see how much we spend
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.380]   in all these different categories.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.860]   We get to see how on both a category and subcategory level,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.960]   we get to see our month to date trends.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.800]   I love that.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.140]   I love that we can go in and look at
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.300]   here's how much we spend in one area
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.880]   and here's how much we spend in another
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.800]   and actually ask ourselves
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   whether that's aligned with how we wanna spend our money.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.780]   We often ask ourselves two questions.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.760]   One, if we were gonna spend more money,
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.940]   where would we put it?
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.340]   Is there a category where we feel like we're too restrained?
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.380]   And then we ask ourselves,
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.180]   if we were to cut from our current spending,
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.220]   where would we cut?
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.700]   And then the real fun
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.800]   is when you look at those two things and compare it.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.580]   So let's say you're looking at all of your expenses
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.680]   and you say, if we could add 10% more,
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.940]   I think we'd travel more.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.220]   And if we could cut 10%, I think we'd eat out less.
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.580]   Well, you can actually ask yourself,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.100]   do we actually wanna travel more and eat out less now?
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.980]   And you can consider swapping them and reallocating.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.840]   And I think it's a really interesting exercise
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.060]   to just think about where would we spend more of?
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.540]   Where would we spend less of?
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.340]   And how do those two things align?
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.540]   Also, like I said before,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.460]   I love that I can see these upcoming recurring expenses,
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.700]   ones that are overdue, track how they've changed over time,
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.500]   know when it's time to go call up companies
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.660]   to negotiate better prices and all of that.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.460]   I also think it puts a lot of expenses in perspective.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.660]   It's really easy for me to get stressed out
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.060]   when I'm going to the grocery store
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.500]   and I see something I want that's not on sale, but often is,
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.860]   especially when it comes to fruit and all the berries
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.300]   that we buy because our kids love them.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.860]   And when you look at the grocery budget in whole
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.020]   and you look at how much money
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.300]   you're spending a year in general,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.420]   it makes it a little easier
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.620]   to just stop sweating the small stuff.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.980]   I like how Ramit Sethi says,
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.820]   "Don't ask yourself the $3 questions,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.300]   "ask yourself the $30,000 questions."
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.460]   I think we can get caught up in,
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.420]   "Ooh, what if we cut this dollar here, this dollar there?"
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.260]   But when you look at it in the big picture,
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.020]   you realize that a lot of those small decisions
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.640]   could add up, but they're not really gonna move the needle,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.580]   like making major changes
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.460]   or spending a lot more time on earning more,
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.700]   starting a side hustle,
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.180]   negotiating your salary or stuff like that.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.900]   Also, one of the most valuable parts of doing this
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.660]   is that I can share all of this work with Amy
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.780]   and we can have a shared view
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.140]   of how we're spending all of our money.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.880]   In most relationships I've found,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.060]   there's one person that gets a lot more excited
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.780]   about doing all this work than the other.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.060]   And by having a central place to do it,
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.940]   you can give the other person a login
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.820]   or in some apps, you can have shared logins
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.860]   and you can let your partner get access to all of it as well
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.260]   and see how you're spending money
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.460]   and sparks really interesting conversations
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.060]   like the one I just talked about,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.700]   where you can be intentional and proactive
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.740]   about how you spend money.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.100]   I've often started sharing a lot of this information
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.200]   with friends.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.780]   So I find that I'm a lot more open with people about money,
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.060]   so maybe it's not for you,
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.060]   but I'll pull out CoPilot,
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.700]   especially with a couple of friends I know do this as well
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.500]   in CoPilot and we'll be like,
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.820]   oh, how much are you spending here?
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.140]   How much are you spending there?
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.540]   And it creates these really interesting conversations
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.020]   that I feel like we don't often have about money
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.460]   and it makes it really easy
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.220]   and almost fun to compare notes with friends.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.580]   Finally, one thing I didn't mention
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.540]   is that with all these apps,
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.700]   there might be something you wanna look up
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.180]   or do that you can't.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.020]   And for almost all of them,
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.980]   I know for sure within CoPilot,
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.060]   you can export all the transactions
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.500]   and all the data you've categorized
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.940]   and all the work you've done to a CSV
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.740]   and use it for whatever you want.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.220]   And so for example,
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.340]   I wanna send all of our work expenses to our CPA
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.420]   so I can go and export everything,
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   filter out everything but work expenses
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.980]   and have a really clean spreadsheet
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.020]   that I can forward on.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.100]   So it is very possible with most of these tools
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.820]   to be able to export all your data.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.340]   Maybe you wanna do more complicated analysis.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.740]   At one point I was kind of thinking,
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.220]   ooh, I not only wanna know how much I spend
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.260]   but how much do I spend in the first half of the month
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.940]   versus the second half of the month
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.620]   so I can decide how much money I need
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.660]   in my checking account at certain days.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.580]   Ultimately that just ended up being too much overhead
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.460]   but that kind of analysis,
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.900]   if you can't do it within an app,
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.820]   you can at least export your transactions
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.060]   and do it on your own.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.620]   Ultimately, almost every time I've done this,
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.100]   it's ended up being a waste of time
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.940]   but it is something that's possible.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.300]   So that's all the benefits of doing this.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.180]   I hope that was really helpful.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.580]   For the next part of this episode,
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.380]   I wanna dive in deeper to all the categories of spending
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.700]   and really talk about ways
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.340]   that you can think about saving money here.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.620]   This is gonna be a little quick
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.460]   and for some of them,
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.500]   there's an entire episode of the show I've done about this.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.660]   So let's just go straight into it.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.300]   So on household, first category for me is home loans,
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.660]   could be rent for you.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.460]   I'm gonna send everyone to episode 14,
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.220]   which was all about house hacking.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.420]   I think there's so much good content in there
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.020]   that could help you think about that.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   So while it's not quite saving money
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.340]   and this really applies to all the categories,
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.260]   but making sure you're at least getting the most
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.100]   out of the spending on that category is another way to save
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.220]   or really to earn more, if you will.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.580]   So if you have rent,
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.180]   definitely consider the built card
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.300]   where you can earn one point per dollar on rent
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.220]   up to $100,000 a year.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.300]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.500]   I wish I either had some rent
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.020]   or they accepted mortgage payments
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.260]   so I could make this work.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.180]   And if you wanna check that out,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.180]   you can use my referral link, allthehacks.com/built.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.580]   And last, this isn't for everyone,
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.380]   but if one of your home expenses or future home expenses
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.020]   might be a second home,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.900]   definitely take a look at Picasso.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.260]   It's a company that finds really amazing vacation homes
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.100]   in lots of different destinations,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.460]   puts them into an LLC
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.220]   and makes it really easy for people to buy 1/8 of them.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.460]   So you don't have to buy the entire house.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.780]   I can tell you that our monthly payment for our Picasso
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.180]   is way smaller than it would have been
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.220]   if we bought a similar vacation home.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.860]   They're also a sponsor of the show.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.300]   So if you wanna get early access
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.420]   to a lot of their properties
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.100]   or get some credits towards closing costs,
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.380]   you can go to allthehacks.com/picasso.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.420]   Next category is dog or pets.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.380]   I wish I had a good answer here, but I don't.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.260]   I don't really know a great way to save money on your pet.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.980]   Definitely shop around if you have a dog walker
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.060]   or if you're sending your dog somewhere overnight,
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.560]   maybe you can find some deals.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.820]   But other than that, I don't really have anything here.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.540]   I guess we've got a dog that doesn't shed,
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.060]   so we don't have a lot of grooming costs.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.980]   But other than that, I don't have a lot.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.420]   On the insurance category,
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.780]   I have an entire episode dedicated to this.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.380]   It's episode 104.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.700]   A recent email from an Apple podcast listener
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.500]   said they saved over $15,000 a year
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.980]   implementing a lot of the things
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.500]   they learned from that episode.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.060]   So if you wanna save money on insurance,
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.660]   highly recommend going there.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.580]   There was one other hack
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.060]   that I don't know if was in that episode,
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.720]   but was definitely in another one,
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.100]   which was just if you have an emergency fund
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.740]   that allows you to maybe increase your deductibles
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.260]   on some of your policies,
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.580]   it will ultimately result in you
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.220]   lowering your monthly expenses.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.360]   So if you wanna use your emergency fund
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.620]   to raise your deductibles,
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.100]   you can cut your monthly insurance costs.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.900]   On bills and expenses,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.320]   that's phone, internet, cable, stuff like that.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.920]   So one thing, negotiate all these bills.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.900]   When we had cable,
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.260]   it felt like every year our cable bill would increase.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.700]   We had to call Comcast, get them to lower the price.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.260]   You can also use a tool like Rocket Money
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.360]   to automatically do a lot of this negotiation for you.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.820]   Definitely shop around.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.420]   I think bundling always seems like it's the cheapest deal,
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.260]   but that's not always true.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.220]   And then consider canceling your TV
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.700]   for internet services, YouTube TV, or something like that.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.860]   And last on cell phones,
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.060]   I have an episode that I'm working on
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.020]   that's almost done and ready to go,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.460]   all about cell phones and cell phone insurance
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.300]   and saving money.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.980]   I compare all the carriers in the US
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.380]   across a lot of different categories.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.240]   The preview was that
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.940]   if you don't need international coverage,
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.220]   hands down, the best option was Mint Mobile.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.820]   We use Mint Mobile in our household.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.060]   I got a Mint Mobile account for our au pair.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.300]   They are now a sponsor of the show.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.740]   So thank you, Mint Mobile.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.900]   You can go to allthehacks.com/mintmobile
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.540]   and get a plan for as little as $15 a month
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.180]   for unlimited data.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:33.100]   And at the high end on the, I want unlimited data,
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   I don't wanna worry about eSIMS,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.980]   it was really neck and neck between T-Mobile and Google Fi.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.060]   But if you're gonna make a change to any of this,
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.740]   definitely go listen to that episode.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.200]   It will be out soon, I promise.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.780]   I just have to wrap it up, but I hope you enjoy.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.020]   So next is home.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.300]   Shout out to my wife, Amy,
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.340]   who came up with a bunch of these.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.620]   I'll just run through a few.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.840]   First, keeping your house organized.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.420]   So Amy just reorganized our entire pantry.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.180]   It looks absolutely incredible.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.500]   And through that process,
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.580]   we realized there was stuff like chicken broth
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.340]   where we had plenty of it and we were still buying it.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.180]   So the more organized I think your house is,
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.900]   the more you know exactly what you have
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.860]   and the more you're not buying stuff you don't need.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.820]   Next, I have two things
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.900]   that are a little bit opposing forces.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.820]   One is depending on where you live,
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.380]   it's probably very easy to get things delivered
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.340]   same day or even next day.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.420]   So for certain purchases,
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.620]   don't buy them if you think you're gonna need them,
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.540]   especially if they're not that urgent.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.420]   Wait until you actually need it.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.980]   I know that there are a lot of things in this house
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.860]   that I've said, "Oh, that's something we might need one day.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.940]   "Let's get that."
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:34.420]   If I had just waited until I needed it,
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.260]   there are a lot of them
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.100]   that I never would have ended up buying.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.940]   On the flip side,
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.820]   if there are things you absolutely know you need regularly,
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.180]   paper towels, deodorant, toilet paper,
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.820]   buy them in bulk or on sale.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.660]   I do this at Costco all the time.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.140]   If Costco doesn't have toilet paper
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.900]   or paper towels on sale, I don't buy it.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.420]   If I'm going to Costco and I see it on sale, I buy it
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.240]   because I know we're always gonna need that product.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.220]   Even better if it's things that are smaller,
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.340]   like deodorant, where whenever it's on sale,
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.940]   I buy that in bulk
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.180]   and then I just put it under the cabinet in the bathroom
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.380]   and I know that I'll have it for a long time.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.340]   Next one doesn't really reduce your cost
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.100]   as much as it reduces your net cost,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.500]   but if you're buying any major appliances,
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.540]   make sure to look into whether it makes sense
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.500]   to sell your used appliances.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.340]   When we bought a new washer and dryer,
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.900]   our old ones were older, but they still worked
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.400]   and they offered to pick them up free of charge.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.980]   But the day before delivery,
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.060]   I listed them on Facebook Marketplace
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.820]   and we ended up selling the washer and dryer for a few $100.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.660]   Someone picked them up that same day.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.060]   So what we thought might've been something
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.300]   we were just gonna have someone take away for free,
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.140]   we were able to sell
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.300]   and offset the cost of the new washer and dryer.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.500]   Also, if you have gardening in your house,
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.460]   in the winter, you often don't need it as much.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.500]   So the gardener might not tell you,
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.140]   hey, do you wanna cut back your visits
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.420]   from once every two weeks to once a month?
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:47.740]   But you can always request that.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.780]   So I know in the winter we reduce ours to once a month.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.900]   So that's all for houses.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.020]   On utilities, I'll give one hack,
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.340]   which is to go check your energy plan.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.080]   Some states don't have different plans,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.140]   but at least in the Bay Area with PG&E,
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.900]   there's five or six different plans you can choose from.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.180]   And they are basically different prices
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.140]   based on times of day and depending on your usage,
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.820]   there might be one that makes a lot more sense
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.060]   and costs a lot less.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.740]   There's also a ton of stuff you can do
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:16.340]   to save money on energy, solar, batteries, LEDs,
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.700]   water heater temperatures.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.740]   And we actually have an entire episode coming up on that.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:24.100]   So I'll punt the rest of these hacks to that episode.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.540]   And then when it comes to property taxes,
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.060]   I don't have a good way to save money on property taxes.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.860]   So I don't know what to say.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:31.780]   It sucks.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.100]   Moving into car and transport.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.500]   On car, a lot of people have emailed
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.460]   suggesting different ways to save money
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.420]   with gas station loyalty programs.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.460]   So definitely look up
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.860]   those gas station loyalty programs for sure.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.740]   I also know a lot of the grocery apps
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.580]   have gas station loyalty points that tie into that.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.980]   Obviously make sure that those loyalty programs
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.900]   are worth the discount relative to the cost they charge.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.820]   If they're the most expensive gas in town
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.980]   and you can get a discount,
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.500]   but it still ends up being more expensive,
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.620]   it's not really a deal.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.700]   To be clear, I don't know a lot about these programs
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.060]   because the only vehicle we have that takes gas is a Vespa.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.300]   And I fill it up about one gallon at a time
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.900]   and it's just not worth trying to save money
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.900]   on gas when we only spend about, I don't know,
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.620]   $100 a year on gas.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.740]   Another one that I thought was really surprising
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.220]   the first time I did this
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   was getting multiple quotes anytime you need service.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.580]   I was blown away when we had a,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.620]   I think it was a power steering pressure hose go out
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.540]   and the range in prices
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.580]   was like from 1,000 to $5,000 or something like that.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.980]   I don't remember the exact price,
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.220]   but it was that wide of a range.
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.940]   So definitely make sure you get a few quotes
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.860]   anytime you need service for your vehicle.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.460]   On transportation, if you work at a company
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.020]   that offers an FSA for transportation expenses,
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.300]   you can use pre-tax money to buy transit passes,
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.060]   often parking, so definitely look at that.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.620]   And for ride sharing,
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.460]   your credit card might already give you discounts
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.100]   through things like a Lyft Pink membership,
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.420]   which I know you can get with a lot of chase cards,
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.580]   and link all of your cards to all these loyalty programs.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:03.980]   You're not gonna save money,
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.460]   but if every dollar you spend,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.780]   you're earning Delta miles or Hilton points
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.860]   or something like that,
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.160]   it's like saving money in that you're earning a lot.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.300]   When it comes to children, which is the next category,
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.740]   there's actually a lot of questions you all have sent in.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.100]   And Amy and I were talking about
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.060]   how to incorporate it into the show.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.380]   And I think what we're gonna do next year
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.100]   is a series of episodes
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.420]   tackling a lot of the things related to kids and parenting,
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.940]   maybe even relationships
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.940]   that aren't relevant to everyone listening.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.340]   Not everyone has kids,
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.060]   but that are relevant to a lot of people.
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:37.380]   And we'll probably do like a four to 10 episode mini series
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.620]   releasing those episodes,
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.620]   not on the core Wednesday release date,
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:43.680]   but another episode each week for a limited time
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.540]   to hit on a lot of children topics.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.100]   So we're gonna cover a lot of those things here.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.300]   Within childcare, we have an au pair,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.380]   which I think is both an amazing experience
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.000]   and an amazing way to save money on childcare
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.100]   if you have the extra room.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.940]   On children, one big thing,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.040]   we buy a lot of the kids' toys, bikes, stuff used,
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.420]   or get hand-me-downs.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.780]   We build up the karma for that
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.700]   by giving away a lot of our old stuff for our kids,
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.420]   but more kids' stuff in those episodes.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.020]   On education, there's gonna be another episode on this
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.340]   in that whole series, so look out for that.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.100]   But one thing to keep in mind is take a look.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.580]   A lot of cities actually run their own
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.900]   afterschool programs, preschools, classes
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.660]   that are way, way cheaper than a lot of the private ones.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.100]   So you might be able to save money there.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.820]   Next, health and wellness.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:30.980]   On fitness, I don't have much
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.680]   other than that there's a lot of free content on YouTube
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.860]   and apps that you can use to get free content
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.840]   that might save you the cost of going to classes
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.420]   or spending money on a gym.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.180]   But honestly, I think health and fitness
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.420]   is a really important category.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.780]   So it's one of the places where Amy and I
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.640]   often ask ourselves, if we could spend more money,
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.540]   where would we spend it?
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.340]   And our health is one of those things.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.740]   So broader theme,
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.560]   just as I'm going through all these categories,
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.620]   I am not trying to tell you
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.140]   here's all the ways to cut your costs because you need to.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.680]   I'm trying to tell you here are thoughts about how to do it,
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.620]   but at the end of the day,
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.060]   some of these things might be areas
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.740]   where you actually wanna spend more money on
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.300]   and you could skip right past it.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.620]   When it comes to healthcare,
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.380]   my goal is to get an episode out before open enrollment
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.740]   this year, all about how I think about health insurance
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:13.920]   and different options.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.120]   So expect that soon, but ways to save money.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.460]   If you have access to an FSA or an HSA, they're fantastic.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:22.780]   If you have healthcare bills that are really high,
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.420]   go back and listen to episode 34,
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.120]   where I talked to Marshall Allen
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.620]   about fighting the healthcare system
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.340]   and getting better deals on healthcare
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.720]   and lowering your bills.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.580]   It is a goldmine of information
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.100]   if you're in that situation.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.180]   And then there's some programs like GoodRx,
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.000]   which are helpful to get discounts on prescriptions.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.740]   In personal care, a lot of things by bulk on sale,
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.020]   one option, if you live in a city
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.700]   and you're willing to accept a little bit of risk
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.300]   when it comes to your haircuts,
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.280]   if you go on Craigslist,
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.420]   you can often find beauty schools and salons
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.540]   and barber shops that need hair models.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.820]   A lot of times they're looking for specific haircuts
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.980]   that you need, like maybe they're looking for someone
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.100]   who wants a buzz or a bob or something,
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.180]   but they're usually stylists in training,
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.940]   but they're almost always supervised
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.360]   by someone more senior.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.780]   So definitely could be a way to save money on haircuts.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.380]   Could be as little as $0.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.980]   Sometimes they're just discounted.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.820]   And then only because they're a product I love
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.860]   and use every week,
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.920]   if you wanna save money on razor blades,
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.160]   I definitely think you should check out Henson.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.020]   They're a sponsor of the show.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.060]   I'm a huge fan of Henson.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.220]   It's significantly cheaper than buying cartridges
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.380]   and a traditional razor.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.620]   And I think it's honestly a much better shave.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.660]   I went about a week or two shaving
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.480]   with two different razors on each side,
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.860]   just to see if I really thought it was a better razor.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.700]   And it was.
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.180]   If you wanna get a hundred free blades
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.900]   with your first purchase on Henson,
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.460]   go to allthehacks.com/henson.
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:45.860]   In lifestyle, I'll run through a few things here.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.740]   In subscriptions, like I mentioned earlier with bills,
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.580]   cut them or negotiate them.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.500]   You're gonna hear about this in the cell phone episode,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.540]   but there are some subscriptions that are included
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.940]   with certain cell phone providers,
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.340]   or maybe even included for a premium,
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.140]   but that's less than the regular cost.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.700]   So I know with some T-Mobile plans,
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.100]   you get free Apple TV Plus and free Netflix.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.740]   You can save some money there.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.420]   And then last, if you're signing up for a subscription
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.380]   that you wanna make sure you don't cancel,
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.980]   use a virtual credit card.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:14.140]   Capital One has a really slick system for creating them.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.340]   Or if you don't have them through your credit card company,
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.020]   you can go to privacy.com,
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.540]   which is a company that helps make this process easier.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.940]   You could put in a credit card
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.020]   to set up a trial of some service,
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.500]   and you can have it deactivate the next day
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.840]   so that if you forget to cancel it during the trial,
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.020]   you won't get charged.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.700]   On entertainment, here is one fun hack
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.460]   that's very, very specific to escape rooms,
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.980]   which Amy and I are massive fans of.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.100]   If you happen to be listening
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.020]   and are a huge fan of escape rooms as well,
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.100]   send me any recommendations you have.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.180]   Every time we're traveling,
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.660]   we try to do the best room in any city.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.780]   And honestly, we also try to do them without other people.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.500]   Like we much prefer to do a room with just the two of us.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.780]   A lot of escape rooms though,
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.540]   make you pay for the number of people that room could hold
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.220]   if you wanna do it privately.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.180]   So we'll sometimes look at the calendar,
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.840]   and if we see an escape room that has all the spaces free,
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.200]   we might head over there,
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.420]   knowing that someone else could book it last minute,
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.500]   walk in there right before the room starts and say,
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.020]   "Hey, we'll book two people."
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:11.980]   And we'll know right then
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.620]   that we're able to get it at a deal.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.060]   If not, we'll go dinner, have drinks somewhere nearby.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.180]   For a lot of zoos and museums,
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.220]   they're actually set up as nonprofits,
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.020]   and getting a membership could be tax deductible.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.900]   On top of that,
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.480]   a lot of those memberships have reciprocal discounts.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   So when we're traveling
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.760]   with the two museum memberships we have,
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.020]   there are hundreds of zoos and science museums
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.860]   that we actually get access to,
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.760]   either free or for a discount with our membership.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.840]   Another one is for last minute tickets.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.740]   This also works with concerts and Broadway shows.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.680]   It's just getting right near the venue,
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.560]   similar to the escape room one,
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.700]   and buying the tickets right when the event starts
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.240]   or 10 minutes before, or if it's a concert,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.040]   even a little bit after it starts,
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.160]   if you don't care about the opening act.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.460]   I have a couple of friends that did this
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.000]   for the Taylor Swift show.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.480]   They bought their tickets like 45 minutes
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.400]   after the show started.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.080]   It was before Taylor went on,
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.000]   but the owners of these tickets on StubHub
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.640]   were dropping the prices rapidly
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.680]   because they knew if they didn't sell them at some point,
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.720]   they would get nothing.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.080]   On personal, I don't have much,
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.920]   'cause like I said earlier,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.160]   I don't even know what that category really was.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.720]   On travel, a third of this entire show is about travel.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.180]   So go listen to those episodes.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.400]   In food and drink, when it comes to groceries,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.600]   I think the biggest thing here is to make a plan.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.200]   And if you have a plan and it's organized,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.520]   you're gonna really make sure you're buying
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.000]   the things you need for that plan
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.560]   and not aimlessly buying things at the grocery store.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.260]   We do all our planning with the Paprika app.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.920]   I keep emailing them trying to get a deal
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.360]   for listeners and members, but I've been unsuccessful.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.000]   We do three of our meals a week using Green Chef.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.240]   We did that before they were sponsors of the show.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.720]   We're such big fans of it.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.540]   We've tried a bunch of meal kits and we like them the most.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.000]   If you wanna get 60% off your first order,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.800]   you can go to allthehacks.com/greenchef
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.000]   and let me know what you think.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.400]   There's a small, tiny little hack that I think's cool.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.700]   The average person that walks around
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.320]   the grocery store backwards saves 4% or 5%
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.720]   on their grocery bill, so that's one to try.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.420]   And specifically, I mean walk all the way
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.340]   to the end of the grocery store and come back,
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.500]   not turn around and walk backwards.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.800]   Definitely be using the grocery apps.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.180]   Every time I'm going to Safeway, I pull up the Safeway app,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.640]   and I'm pretty convinced that the coupons in that app
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.160]   save me at least 10% every single time.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.400]   I don't know why, but it seems like every time
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.000]   I open that app, there's a $3 to $10 off
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.080]   my grocery store purchase coupon in my account.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.560]   And then in episode 131, a couple weeks ago,
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.120]   I talked a lot about buying bulk meat,
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.520]   so go back and check that out
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.920]   if you wanna save money on meat.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.000]   On the dining and drinks category,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.680]   obviously you could just go out less, that's an option.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.320]   You could go early to a lot of places
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.200]   that have happy hour specials.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.280]   If you are regularly ordering food online,
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.100]   check if your credit card has any deals
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.160]   to get programs with them.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.480]   For example, Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.720]   you get DoorDash credit and you get free Dash Pass.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.240]   So when we're ordering food, we're using DoorDash.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.400]   Amex gets $10 off on Grubhub.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.080]   So we're using those programs to get a deal
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.440]   if we wanna order food.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.240]   DoorDash happens to be a sponsor of the show,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.040]   so I will say if you haven't tried it out,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.360]   but you have a Chase credit card
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.580]   and you wanna get a free Dash Pass and free credits,
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.600]   I would love it if you signed up
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   at allthehacks.com/doordash.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.100]   And then last, there's an app that I am very new to,
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:26.240]   but I just saw promoted by a friend of mine called InKind.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.360]   And it lets you buy credits that you can use
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.560]   at restaurants for a discount.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.500]   And normally I look at these and think,
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.980]   gosh, the restaurants on this app might be really terrible,
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.000]   but I saw some really great restaurants in San Francisco
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.660]   we would regularly go to.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.180]   So if you wanna check this out
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.100]   and see if there are any restaurants worth going to
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.540]   where you live, they're not a sponsor of the show,
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.500]   but I do have a referral code that you can get $25 off
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.780]   at allthehacks.com/inkind.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.220]   To be clear, I have not used this,
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   so I don't wanna fully endorse it,
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.480]   but if it looks interesting and you want a free $25,
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.740]   you can use that code.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.460]   I think that's all for dining and drinks.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.780]   This is an area similar to health
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.480]   where we enjoy good food, we enjoy going out,
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.700]   so I'm not always looking to cut costs here.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.380]   And in many cases when we're traveling,
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.840]   this is some of the most exciting ways we spend money.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.300]   In shopping, there is a lot.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.500]   So I am always trying to stack as many different deals
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.700]   when I'm buying stuff.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.280]   So that means looking for coupons,
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.740]   sometimes buying coupons on Craigslist
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.780]   or Facebook Marketplace, which I've done.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.240]   If you have a really big purchase,
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.220]   you can buy coupons for places like Home Depot
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.900]   or Crate and Barrel for a lot less.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.680]   You can get them sometimes when you get the change
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.760]   of a dress pack from USPS.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.020]   Looking for promo codes or even live chatting
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.740]   with a store to get those promo codes.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.680]   Looking for cashback options.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.300]   I love going to Cashback Monitor,
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.500]   which is a website that shows you the best cash
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.960]   and points back options for any purchase.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.060]   And then last, buying gift cards for the retailer.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.780]   Either at a discount online,
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.920]   there are sites where you can buy discounted gift cards,
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.500]   or at a minimum going to a place
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.480]   where you earn a lot of extra points.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.420]   If you have a grocery card or an office supply store card,
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.900]   and you can go buy gift cards for other merchants
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.380]   and get a lot more points per dollar
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.980]   on the grocery card purchase, and then using those.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.740]   There are a bunch of apps.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.580]   Camel Camel Camel is one of them.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.580]   There's another one, I think it's called Wistia,
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.820]   where you can track prices on Amazon
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:22.340]   and find out whether it's regularly cheaper and hold off.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.420]   I love Library Extension for getting free eBooks.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.300]   In episode 113,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.940]   I covered all the hidden benefits of credit cards.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.860]   Things like purchase protection.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.120]   So definitely another way that you can make sure you save,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.940]   especially if you buy something and it breaks,
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.200]   you can get your money back.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.780]   There's a lot of buy nothing groups on Facebook.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:41.540]   You can look on all kinds of sites to buy things used.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.500]   I do that a lot.
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:43.940]   A lot of stores do price matching.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.500]   I probably should have mentioned that in stacking,
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.940]   but definitely look around for price matching.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.060]   And then almost every credit card issuer has offers.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.860]   So always making sure you're looking at the Amex offers,
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.900]   the Chase offers, the Capital One offers,
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.540]   to see if there is some deal that could earn you money back.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:02.140]   I know, for example, there was one on Chase a few weeks ago
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.120]   where you got 10% off Southwest.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.280]   There's two components to this.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.640]   One is making sure you see them and activate them,
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.500]   and the other is making sure you use the right card
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.760]   when you're spending money at the merchant.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.420]   I'm a big fan of the Card Pointers app
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.980]   because it auto enrolls you in all of these offers.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.560]   You do still need to look at the offers
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.840]   to make sure you use the right card to get that offer,
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.080]   but Card Pointers Pro is awesome for that.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.580]   And you get 30% off as an AllTheHacks listener
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.940]   at allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.620]   In clothing, I don't have a lot.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.700]   There are a lot of sales.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.440]   So if what you're trying to buy isn't urgent,
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.860]   maybe just wait for a sale.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.140]   So last category is gifts and donations.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.560]   When it comes to gifts, one thing is just buying early.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.260]   So you're not scrambling last minute,
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.580]   paying extra for shipping or not being able to shop around.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.580]   Another one is gifting experiences.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.900]   It's kind of cool if you really love something
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.260]   and you wanna give someone a gift,
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.540]   can you combine those two
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.700]   so you're getting both an experience and a gift
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.580]   with someone you care about?
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.980]   Another one is just being thoughtful.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.540]   For me, I would rather get a $10 gift
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.740]   that was really thoughtful
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.120]   that someone spent a lot of time thinking about
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.940]   than a $500 gift that was just some random thing
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.220]   they found on the internet that they thought I would like
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.900]   or that I was gonna buy myself anyways.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.620]   So I give, I don't know what the right multiple is,
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.740]   but it's probably somewhere between a two to five X multiple
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.700]   for thoughtful gifts in terms of the value they have for me.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.860]   And then last is probably a controversial one,
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.460]   which is just remove gifting.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.520]   I am not someone, given what I said about thoughtful gifts,
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.740]   I'm not someone who likes gifting things that are on a list.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.540]   And I remember one Christmas in one of our families,
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.280]   people were like, what's on everybody's list?
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.380]   Can everyone share their lists
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.980]   so we can buy all the Christmas gifts?
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:40.060]   And I was like, I feel like what's going on
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.780]   in the background is everyone is just thinking,
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.820]   I wanna spend X dollars on each person.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.940]   Let's look at their list,
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.460]   let's buy them something on their list.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.140]   And then we're all just passing money around each other.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.180]   What if we all just said
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.460]   what we'd wanna spend on each other?
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.820]   We netted it out on a spreadsheet
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.160]   and we Venmoed each other.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.140]   And people were like, that's a horrible idea.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.980]   And I was like, but it's kind of the same thing,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.980]   except it's even worse.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.220]   Because if I'm gonna go buy something,
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.180]   I'm gonna do all the things that I mentioned earlier
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.820]   to stack and save.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.840]   And I know a lot of the people in our family aren't.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.900]   So they're actually gonna end up spending more
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.140]   to get this thing than I would,
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.300]   which just inside drives me nuts.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.900]   So what we ended up doing ultimately was saying,
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.860]   look, if we're not together for the holidays,
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.100]   which we often alternate between my and Amy's family,
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.300]   no gifts.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.580]   And if we are together,
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.980]   we started switching to say,
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   maybe every sibling and parent picks one other person.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.180]   And we even did it for just couples.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.700]   So there were four couples
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.380]   between three siblings and parents,
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.000]   each one got one other one
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.260]   and did one nice gift for that couple.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.440]   Removed a lot of the money that we were all spending
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.060]   to just buy things for, in my opinion,
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.520]   the purpose of buying things.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.160]   You could also set up gift caps to try to lower the cost.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.760]   There's a lot of stuff you could do.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.880]   I have some controversial opinions on gifts,
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.020]   totally hear that, it might not be for you.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.480]   And then last on donations,
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.580]   there are a lot of tax benefits of donations.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.000]   It can be a lot of headache
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.540]   because you've got to keep and track all of your receipts.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.640]   One way we solve this is we do all of our donating
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.740]   to our Daffy account, which is a donor advised fund.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.600]   If you want to learn more,
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.640]   I did a whole episode with Adam Nash
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.760]   who started the company in episode 50.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.600]   The basic premise is you get an account
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.200]   and you can donate money, stocks, crypto.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.800]   And at the time of that donation, it's a tax deduction.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.640]   However, you don't have to allocate that money right away.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.760]   So we were able to, in one of our higher tax years,
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.300]   donate a lot of appreciated shares of stock
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.440]   to our Daffy account.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.760]   And now we have a pool of funds
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.200]   that anytime we want to make a donation to,
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.280]   we can type in the name of the charity quickly.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.960]   Both of us have access to Daffy
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.640]   and we can send money to that charity.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.960]   So actually when you look at our donations line item
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.120]   in our budget, it's almost zero every single year
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.220]   because we upfront loaded about 10 years of donations
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.880]   into our Daffy account
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.280]   because it was a really advantageous year
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.000]   to take that tax deduction.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.120]   We had some really highly appreciated stocks
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.280]   we wanted to sell.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.960]   And so we're able to get a really big benefit that year.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.000]   And now we can actually invest the money
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.120]   in our Daffy account.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.600]   So it's been growing every year
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.440]   and hopefully it should give us money to donate to charity
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.160]   for at least 10 years, if not more.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.000]   If you wanna check it out,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.120]   you can get a free $25 to donate to the charity

[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.760]   Okay, that was a lot.
