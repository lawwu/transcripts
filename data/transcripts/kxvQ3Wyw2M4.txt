[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   - So coming back to the textbook definition
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.760]   of quantum mechanics, this idea that I don't think
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.760]   we talked about, can you, this one of the most
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.000]   interesting philosophical points, we talked
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.440]   at the human level, but at the physics level,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.920]   that at least the textbook definition of quantum mechanics
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520]   separates what is observed and what is real.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.520]   One, how does that make you feel?
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.080]   And two, what does it then mean to observe something
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.800]   and why is it different than what is real?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.160]   - Yeah, you know, my personal feeling, such as it is,
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.060]   is that things like measurement and observers
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.120]   and stuff like that are not going to play
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.700]   a fundamental role in the ultimate laws of physics.
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.400]   But my feeling that way is because so far,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.000]   that's where all the evidence has been pointing.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.600]   I could be wrong and there's certainly a sense
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.120]   in which it would be infinitely cool
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.760]   if somehow observation or mental cogitation
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.400]   did play a fundamental role in the nature of reality.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.920]   But I don't think so and I don't see any evidence for it,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.960]   so I'm not spending a lot of time
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   worrying about that possibility.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.820]   So what do you do about the fact that in the textbook
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.300]   interpretation of quantum mechanics,
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.160]   this idea of measurement or looking at things
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   seems to play an important role?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.760]   Well, you come up with better interpretations
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.720]   of quantum mechanics and there are several alternatives.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.520]   My favorite is the many worlds interpretation,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.320]   which says two things.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.440]   Number one, you, the observer,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.480]   are just a quantum system like anything else.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.800]   There's nothing special about you.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.560]   Don't get so proud of yourself.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.520]   You know, you're just a bunch of atoms.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.920]   You have a wave function.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.560]   You obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.960]   And number two, when you think you're measuring something
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.440]   or observing something, what's really happening is
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.720]   you're becoming entangled with that thing.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.520]   So when you think that there's a wave function
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   for the electron, it's all spread out,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.920]   but you look at it and you only see it in one location.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.040]   What's really happening is that there's still
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.280]   the wave function for the electron in all those locations,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.680]   but now it's entangled with the wave function of you
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.220]   in the following way.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.640]   There's part of the wave function that says
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.680]   the electron was here and you think you saw it there.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.920]   The electron was there and you think you saw it there.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.800]   The electron was over there and you think you saw it there.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   Et cetera.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.680]   So, and all of those different parts of the wave function,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.920]   once they come into being, no longer talk to each other.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.120]   They no longer interact or influence each other.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.640]   It's as if they are separate worlds.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.680]   So this was the invention of Hugh Everett III,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.920]   who was a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950s.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   And he said, basically, look,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.400]   you don't need all these extra rules
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.720]   about looking at things.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.300]   Just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is telling you.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.460]   It's telling you that you have a wave function,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.040]   that you become entangled,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.360]   and that the different versions of you
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.040]   no longer talk to each other.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.720]   So just accept it.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.840]   It's just, he did therapy more than anything else.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   He said, it's okay.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.360]   You don't need all these extra rules.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.520]   All you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.440]   The cost is there's a whole bunch of extra worlds out there.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.840]   - So are the worlds being created
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   whether there's an observer or not?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   - The worlds are created any time a quantum system
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.960]   that's in a superposition becomes entangled
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.160]   with the outside world.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.400]   - What's the outside world?
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.360]   - It depends.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   Let's back up.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.460]   Whatever it really says, what his theory is,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.360]   is there's a wave function of the universe,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   and it obeys the Schrodinger equation all the time.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.200]   That's it.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.880]   That's the full theory right there, okay?
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   The question, all of the work, is how in the world
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.400]   do you map that theory onto reality,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.480]   onto what we observe, right?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.400]   So part of it is carving up the wave function
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160]   into these separate worlds, saying, look,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.400]   it describes a whole bunch of things
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.440]   that don't interact with each other.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.080]   Let's call them separate worlds.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.840]   Another part is distinguishing between systems
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.080]   and their environments.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.000]   And the environment is basically all the degrees of freedom,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.520]   all the things going on in the world
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.320]   that you don't keep track of.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.800]   So again, in the bottle of water,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.120]   I might keep track of the total amount of water
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.280]   and the volume.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.600]   I don't keep track of the individual positions
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.580]   and velocities.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.260]   I don't keep track of all the photons
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.980]   or the air molecules in this room.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.440]   So that's the outside world.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.200]   The outside world is all the parts of the universe
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.620]   that you're not keeping track of
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.620]   when you're asking about the behavior of some subsystem of it.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.320]   - So how many worlds are there?
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.380]   - Yeah, I don't know that one either.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.100]   There could be an infinite number.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.340]   There could be only a finite number,
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.340]   but it's a big number one way or the other.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.140]   - It's just a very, very big number.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.660]   In one of the talks, somebody asked,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.060]   well, if it's finite,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.100]   so actually I'm not sure exactly the logic
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.260]   you used to derive this,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.860]   but is there going to be
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.780]   overlap, a duplicate world that you return to?
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.780]   So you've mentioned, and I'd love if you can elaborate on,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.500]   sort of idea that it's possible
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.320]   that there's some kind of equilibrium
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.980]   that these splitting worlds arrive at.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.700]   And then maybe over time,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.920]   maybe somehow connected to entropy,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.140]   you get a large number of worlds
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.980]   that are very similar to each other.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.620]   - Yeah, so this question of whether or not Hilbert space
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.020]   is finite or infinite dimensional
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.700]   is actually secretly connected to gravity and cosmology.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.220]   This is the part that we're still struggling
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.260]   to understand right now.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.820]   But we discovered back in 1998
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.380]   that our universe is accelerating.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.440]   And what that means, if it continues,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.200]   which we think it probably will, but we're not sure,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400]   but if it does, that means there's a horizon around us.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.960]   Because the universe is not only expanding,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.820]   but expanding faster and faster,
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.920]   things can get so far away from us
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.160]   that from our perspective,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.560]   it looks like they're moving away faster
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.400]   than the speed of light.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.840]   We will never see them again.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.600]   So there's literally a horizon around us,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   and that horizon approaches some fixed distance
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   away from us.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   And you can then argue that within that horizon,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.580]   there's only a finite number of things
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.780]   that can possibly happen,
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.540]   the finite dimensional Hilbert space.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.720]   In fact, we even have a guess for what the dimensionality is
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   is 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 122.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.880]   That's a very large number.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.660]   Just to compare it, the age of the universe
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.500]   is something like 10 to the 14 seconds,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.660]   10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.420]   The number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.900]   But the number of dimensions of Hilbert space
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.580]   is 10 to the 10 to the 122.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.540]   So that's just crazy big.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.020]   If that story is right, that in our observable horizon,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.840]   there's only a finite dimensional Hilbert space,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.460]   then this idea of branching of the wave function
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.860]   of the universe into multiple distinct separate branches
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.020]   has to reach a limit at some time.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.840]   Once you branch that many times,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.020]   you've run out of room in Hilbert space.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.820]   And roughly speaking, that corresponds to the universe
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.060]   just expanding and emptying out and cooling off
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.160]   and entering a phase where it's just empty space,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.440]   literally forever.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.820]   - What's the difference between splitting and copying,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.940]   do you think?
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.780]   Like in terms of, a lot of this is an interpretation
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.780]   that helps us sort of model the world.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.520]   So perhaps shouldn't be thought of as like,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.000]   philosophically or metaphysically,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.220]   but even at the physics level,
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.820]   do you see a difference between sort of generating
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.340]   new copies of the world or splitting?
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.220]   - I think it's better to think of in quantum mechanics,
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.400]   in many worlds, the universe splits rather than new copies,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.020]   because people otherwise worry about things
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.860]   like energy conservation.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.140]   And no one who understands quantum mechanics
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.640]   worries about energy conservation
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.660]   'cause the equation is perfectly clear.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.340]   But if all you know is that someone told you
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.500]   the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable worry
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.940]   about where all the energy for that came from.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.380]   So a preexisting universe splitting
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.100]   into two skinnier universes
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.820]   is a better way of thinking about it.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.540]   And mathematically, it's just like,
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.460]   if you draw an X and Y axis,
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.740]   and you draw a vector of length one, 45 degree angle,
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.460]   you know that you can write that vector of length one
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.100]   as the sum of two vectors pointing along X and Y
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.340]   of length one over the square root of two.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.220]   So I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.280]   but there's a conservation of arrow-ness, right?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.620]   Like there's now two arrows,
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.900]   but the length is the same.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.300]   I just am describing it in a different way.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.660]   And that's exactly what happens when the universe branches.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.640]   The wave function of the universe is a big old vector.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.740]   - So to somebody who brings up a question of saying,
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.660]   doesn't this violate the conservation of energy?
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.040]   Can you give further elaboration?
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.300]   - Right, so let's just be super duper perfectly clear.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.780]   There's zero question about whether or not many worlds
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.220]   violates conservation of energy.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.340]   It does not.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.860]   And I say this definitively because there are other
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.540]   questions that I think there's answers to,
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.540]   but they're legitimate questions, right?
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.300]   About where does probability come from
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.500]   and things like that.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.220]   This conservation of energy question,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.620]   we know the answer to it,
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.140]   and the answer to it is that energy is conserved.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.740]   All of the effort goes into how best to translate
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.780]   what the equation unambiguously says
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.340]   into plain English, right?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.220]   So this idea that there's a universe that has,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.100]   that the universe comes equipped with a thickness,
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.380]   and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.960]   but the total amount of universe is conserved over time
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.820]   is a reasonably good way of putting English words
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.660]   to the underlying mathematics.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.160]   - So one of my favorite things about many worlds is,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.460]   I mean, I love that there's something controversial
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.060]   in science, and for some reason it makes people
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.920]   actually not like upset, but just get excited.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.240]   Why do you think it is a controversial idea?
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.560]   So there's a lot of, it's actually one of the cleanest
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.680]   ways to think about quantum mechanics.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.500]   So why do you think there's a discomfort a little bit
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.960]   among certain people?
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.760]   - Well, I draw the distinction in my book
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.360]   between two different kinds of simplicity
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.280]   in a physical theory.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.560]   There's simplicity in the theory itself, right?
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.080]   How we describe what's going on according to the theory
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.520]   by its own rights.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.040]   But then, you know, a theory is just some sort
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   of abstract mathematical formalism.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.860]   You have to map it onto the world somehow, right?
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.600]   And sometimes, like for Newtonian physics,
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.960]   it's pretty obvious, like, okay, here is a bottle,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.200]   and it has a center of mass, and things like that.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.040]   Sometimes it's a little bit harder,
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.800]   with general relativity, curvature of space-time
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.360]   is a little bit harder to grasp.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.120]   Quantum mechanics is very hard to map
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.600]   what the language you're talking in of wave functions
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.560]   and things like that onto reality.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.400]   And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.040]   where it is hardest to map on the underlying formalism
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.160]   to reality.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.320]   So that's where the lack of simplicity comes in,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.180]   not in the theory, but in how we use the theory
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.280]   to map onto reality.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.240]   And in fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.480]   many worlds quantum mechanics is in this effort
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.720]   to map it on to the world that we see.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.680]   So it's perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right?
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.840]   To say like, well, no, that's just too far away
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.240]   from my experience.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.880]   I am therefore intrinsically skeptical of it.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.600]   Of course, you should give up on that skepticism
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.920]   if there are no alternatives,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.360]   and this theory always keeps working,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.560]   then eventually you should overcome your skepticism.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.160]   But right now, there are alternatives that are,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.520]   that people work to make alternatives
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.480]   that are by their nature closer
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   to what we observe directly.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.600]   - Can you describe the alternatives?
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   I don't think we touched on it.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   So the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.440]   maybe there's a difference between the Everettian
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.520]   many worlds and many worlds as it is now,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   like has the idea sort of developed and so on.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.960]   And just in general,
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.680]   what is the space of promising contenders?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.200]   We have democratic debates now,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.640]   there's a bunch of candidates.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.760]   - 12 candidates on stage. - 12 candidates on stage.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.640]   What are the quantum mechanical candidates
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.760]   on stage for the debate?
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.240]   - So if you had a debate
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.480]   between quantum mechanical contenders,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.600]   there'd be no problem getting 12 people up there on stage,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   but there would still be only three front runners.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.280]   (both laughing)
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.440]   And right now the front runners would be Everett.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.760]   Hidden variable theories are another one.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.240]   So the hidden variable theories say
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.400]   that the wave function is real,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.200]   but there's something in addition to the wave function.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.440]   The wave function is not everything,
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.600]   it's part of reality, but it's not everything.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.080]   What else is there?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.440]   We're not sure.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.680]   But in the simplest version of the theory,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.240]   there are literally particles.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   So many worlds says that quantum systems
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.920]   are sometimes are wave-like in some ways
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.160]   and particle-like in another
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   because they really, really are waves,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.140]   but under certain observational circumstances,
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.680]   they look like particles.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.880]   Whereas hidden variable says
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.560]   they look like waves and particles
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.640]   'cause there are both waves and particles
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.760]   involved in the dynamics.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.240]   And that's easy to do if your particles
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.880]   are just non-relativistic Newtonian particles moving around,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   they get pushed around by the wave function roughly.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.400]   It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.600]   or quantum gravity into account.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.040]   The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.560]   So in the conventional textbook interpretation,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.920]   we say when you look at a quantum system,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.120]   its wave function collapses
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.320]   and you see it in one location.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.960]   A spontaneous collapse theory says that
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.800]   every particle has a chance per second
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.760]   of having its wave function spontaneously collapse.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.920]   The chance is very small.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.000]   For a typical particle,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.460]   it will take hundreds of millions of years
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.100]   before it happens even once,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.360]   but in a table or some macroscopic object,
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.040]   there are way more than a hundred million particles
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.440]   and they're all entangled with each other.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.080]   So when one of them collapses,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   it brings everything else along with it.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.520]   There's a slight variation of this,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.900]   that's a spontaneous collapse theory.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.660]   There are also induced collapse theories
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.520]   like Roger Penrose thinks that
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.140]   when the gravitational difference
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.400]   between two parts of the wave function becomes too large,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.120]   the wave function collapses automatically.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.320]   So those are basically in my mind,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   the three big alternatives.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.080]   Many worlds, which is just,
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   there's a wave function
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.080]   and always obeys the Schrodinger equation.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.160]   Hidden variables, there's a wave function
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.380]   that always obeys the Schrodinger equation,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.640]   but there are also new variables
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.360]   or collapse theories, which the wave function
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.880]   and sometimes it collapses.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.120]   So you can see that the alternatives
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.740]   are more complicated in their formalism
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.060]   than many worlds is,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.640]   but they are closer to our experience.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.420]   - So just this moment of collapse,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.480]   do you think of it as a,
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.460]   so is a wave function fundamentally
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.620]   sort of a probabilistic description of the world
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.080]   and is collapse sort of reducing that part of the world
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.780]   into something deterministic,
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.860]   where again, you can,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.900]   and I'll describe the position and the velocity
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.220]   in this simple classical model.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.060]   - Well, there is--
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.260]   - Is that how you think about collapse?
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.780]   - There is a fourth category,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   is a fourth contender.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.820]   There's a Mayor Pete of quantum mechanical interpretations,
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.420]   which are called epistemic interpretations.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.140]   And what they say is,
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.720]   all the wave function is,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.220]   is a way of making predictions for experimental outcomes.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.140]   It's not mapping onto an element of reality
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.500]   in any real sense.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.740]   And in fact, two different people
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.380]   might have two different wave functions
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.500]   for the same physical system
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.660]   because they know different things about it, right?
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.220]   The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.900]   And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.700]   is if you say, okay,
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.900]   but it's predicting about what,
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.620]   like what is the thing that is being predicted?
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.580]   And they say, no, no, no.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.700]   That's not what we're here for.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   We're just here to tell you
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.700]   what the observational outcomes are gonna be.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.300]   - But the other interpretations kind of think
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.060]   that the wave function is real.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.040]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.860]   So that's an ontic interpretation of the wave function,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.900]   ontology being the study of what is real, what exists,
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900]   as opposed to an epistemic interpretation
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.820]   of the wave function,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.780]   epistemology being the study of what we know.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.860]   - I would actually just love to see that debate on stage.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.420]   - There was a version of it on stage
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.700]   at the World Science Festival a few years ago
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.780]   that you can look up online.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.620]   - On YouTube?
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.740]   - Yep, it's on YouTube.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.020]   - Okay, awesome.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.460]   I'll link it and watch it.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.780]   - Many words. - Who won?
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.620]   - I won.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620]   (laughing)
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.400]   I don't know, there was no vote.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.360]   There was no vote.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.840]   But Brian Green was the moderator
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   and David Albert stood up for spontaneous collapse
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.860]   and Shelley Goldstein was there for hidden variables
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.600]   and Rüdiger Schock was there for epistemic approaches.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   - Why do you, I think you mentioned it,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.680]   but just to elaborate,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.220]   why do you find many worlds so compelling?
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.620]   - Well, there's two reasons, actually.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.820]   One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.400]   It's like the most bare bones,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.060]   austere, pure version of quantum mechanics.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.980]   And I am someone who is very willing
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.440]   to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.280]   onto reality.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.340]   I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.540]   But the other big reason
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.360]   is that there's something called modern physics
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.780]   with quantum fields and quantum gravity
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.220]   and holography and space-time, doing things like that.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.180]   And when you take any of the other versions
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.780]   of quantum theory, they bring along classical baggage.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.060]   All of the other versions of quantum mechanics
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.580]   prejudice or privilege some version of classical reality
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.200]   like locations in space, okay?
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.720]   And I think that that's a barrier
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.640]   to doing better at understanding the theory of everything
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.800]   and understanding quantum gravity
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.540]   and the inversions of space-time.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.120]   Whenever, if you change your theory from,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.780]   here's a harmonic oscillator, oh, there's a spin,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.640]   here's an electromagnetic field,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.460]   in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse theories,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.580]   you have to start from scratch.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.420]   You have to say like,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.800]   well, what are the hidden variables for this theory?
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.540]   Or how does it collapse or whatever?
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.200]   Whereas many worlds is plug and play.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.140]   You tell me the theory
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.160]   and I can give you as many worlds version.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.820]   So when we have a situation like we have with gravity
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.060]   and space-time, where the classical description
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.320]   seems to break down in a dramatic way,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.540]   then I think you should start from the most quantum theory
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.660]   that you have, which is really many worlds.
