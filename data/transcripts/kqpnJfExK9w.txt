[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   And you were the first person doing the prompt engineering, is that right?
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.360]   That was me.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.200]   Like on day one of the product.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.000]   So what did you learn?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Yeah, it was me.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240]   Teach me how to do prompt engineering.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.720]   What are the first couple of things that you figured out when you were just messing around?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.440]   Oh man, you know, I just didn't know anything.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.880]   Yeah, at first I was probably treating like, you know, these instruct models where it's like,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.800]   you know, write a blog post for me.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.520]   And it's just like, write a blog post for me, write a blog post for me, write a blog post for me,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.240]   write a blog post for me.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.800]   Okay, cool.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.760]   Like what's happening here?
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.800]   Okay, and there's patterns and it's trying to figure out what I want.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   And, you know, I think particularly like early days, we still get a lot of benefit from this is,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.080]   you know, the examples that we would give it, you know, for like, you know, a few shot outputs,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.400]   like really were important.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.760]   And I was able to use examples that I knew for a fact, like converted really well on facial.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.280]   And so we just always use stuff that was proven in the market to like start to steer and give
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.240]   examples there.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.640]   I knew the output I was trying to get to.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.920]   And like, I wouldn't stop until like, it was like, man, like that is really good.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.200]   And I would really use that.
