[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560]   I often say that I'm trying to teach computers how to see.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.200]   And if I want to get more involved,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400]   I say I'm trying to teach computers
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   how to learn how to see.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.100]   The problems we're tackling in terms of autonomous driving,
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.720]   the machine learning challenges are so complex,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960]   and the expectation on robustness
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.440]   is so high that we have to leverage
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.200]   all our strengths combined.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   And so collaboration is extremely important.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.120]   For all the large-scale serious experiments and research
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.760]   projects, the scalability of weights and biases,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   the customizability, the fact that we can really
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.120]   build reports and live monitoring,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.000]   not just like frozen reports of a conclusion,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.040]   all these things are awesome features that really vastly
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.720]   improved our productivity by having this common lingua
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   franca about experiment visualization and logging.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   When you make the effort, because it's an effort,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.360]   to spend a bit more time to integrate
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.840]   with the tools of the team, by yourself, you may go faster.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.440]   But together, we go further.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000]   And these past six months, we've been extremely productive
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.240]   on the research front, submitting five papers
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.840]   to the top conferences in machine learning and computer
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   vision.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640]   I was really impressed with the productivity of the team
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.960]   and the creativity that was unleashed thanks
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.120]   to the benefits of this infrastructure.
