[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Mexico is such a hospitable country, the culture is so hospitable, Mexican culture is so warm.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.680]   It takes two seconds before someone's inviting you into their home. I think that that's where
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.880]   it just really goes off the chart in terms of value. You're getting far superior service than
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.480]   you would get in almost anywhere in the world. The idea of getting invited to someone's home,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.320]   to me, that seems a little foreign. Is that something that you think people visiting might
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.520]   actually experience if they just got off that kind of standard track? Because it feels a little
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.840]   foreign to think about it. Absolutely. I can't encourage people enough to get out of the hotel,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   to go and visit archaeological sites, to visit local people, to interact with the locals. Even
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.640]   if that means having a local guide, opening your eyes, even speaking to the taxi drivers or your
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.400]   transfer driver, the people in a store, you'll really find an incredible warmth and you'll find
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640]   and invitations do flow freely.
