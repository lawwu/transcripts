[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Cremation or burial? It's a question that many of you have asked us to address and of course every one of us and every family will
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   face this question at some point. For some Christians who live in a densely populated area where cemetery space is scarce,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   financial factors can weigh heavy on the decision. In Japan, for example, over 99.9%, over 99.9% of people
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   are cremated. Cities like Tokyo have ordinances requiring it. But taking away the financial factors and all things being
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   equal, from a biblical perspective, what's a better choice? Cremation or burial? It's an interesting question addressed by
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Pastor John a few years ago in a Q&A context. Here's what he said.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Does it matter whether we're cremated or buried? Not ultimately, but I don't ever counsel people towards cremation.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   An old couple had me over a few weeks ago. He's pushing 90 and she's close behind. And the son was there.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And the son said, "The reason I wanted you to come is to tell my dad what you think about creation and cremation and burial."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   A real situation here. They're years away from this, months maybe. Who knows?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Because he had heard me talk about it. And he wants to bury his dad. And the dad's thinking, "Quick, efficient, get it done.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We'll need to do that cheaper." Well, it may not be cheaper. But anyway, here's the essence of what I said.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The biblical pattern is that burning your children is pagan and burying your loved ones is a sign that you believe in the resurrection.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I think I'm going to encourage people towards burial because what it says about the body.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   The body is precious and it is going to be raised from the dead. And so I know it decomposes.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I know it's no more there in 100 years than if you burn it. I know that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   This is, we're talking symbolic significance of a body stretched out there in a coffin, looked at, and lovingly kissed and buried.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Rather than, to me, the horrible prospect of my wife or my child or my dad being burned, incinerated.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I would have to do a major mental escape in order to keep from feeling like that's so out of sync with what the body means to God.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   He created it. He's going to resurrect it. There's going to be continuity between what you were and what you are so you can recognize each other.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You don't want to symbolically destroy it. You want to symbolically put it to rest.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Because that's the language of the Bible. You're sleeping. Right?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He will waken those who sleep. Whether we sleep or wake, we belong to the Lord.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So the picture of the New Testament is the dead are asleep. They're going to be raised from the dead.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And they are alive to God. So I've probably overstated my case now and made all the people who have ever cremated feel terribly guilty.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'll go back to where I began. It is not ultimately an issue of mattering. It doesn't matter ultimately.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's just not a custom I think the New Testament would naturally lead us to.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That was Pastor John in a Q&A session several years ago.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's probably a good place to reiterate something I said back in episode number 301.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And in light of the success of the Ask Pastor John podcast, I wrote Pastor John to ask him how he wants listeners like you to think of these podcasts.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Pastor John wrote back this, "The way I would like listeners to receive my counsel in these podcasts is in the spirit of 1 Thessalonians 5.21.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Test everything. Hold fast to what is good. And the test I hope they use is first the Bible.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's where I try to find all of my responses to people's questions.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And secondly, I hope they esteem the spiritual leaders of their own churches highly and talk to them about the issues they face, which is also 1 Thessalonians 5.13.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There's one final authority and it's God's word, not mine. I want to exalt God's word over and over and over as true and wise and sweet."
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So please listen to every episode in that spirit.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Well, in light of all the religious traditions in the world and all the holy books of those religious traditions, how can we know with absolute certainty that the gospel is true?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   That's the question on the table tomorrow.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
