[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   >>Kaiper What is Hilbert space and Euclidean space?
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.240]   >>John Yeah, you know, I think that people are very
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.120]   welcome to go through their lives not knowing what Hilbert space is. But if you want to
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.720]   dig into a little bit more into quantum mechanics, it becomes necessary. You know, the English
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.000]   language was invented long before quantum mechanics or various forms of higher mathematics
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.280]   were invented. So we use the word space to mean different things. Of course, most of
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.640]   us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we live, right? I mean, some
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   of us just think of it as outer space. Okay, but space around us, it gives us the three
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   dimensional location of things and objects. But mathematicians use any generic abstract
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.880]   collection of elements as a space, okay, a space of possibilities, you know, momentum
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.240]   space, etc. So Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions, either
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.760]   for the universe or for some specific system. And it could be an infinite dimensional space,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.320]   or it could be just really, really large dimensional, but finite, we don't know, because we don't
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.720]   know the final theory of everything. But this abstract Hilbert space is really, really,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.360]   really big and has no immediate connection to the three dimensional space in which we
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   live.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.160]   >>Kaiper What do dimensions in Hilbert space mean?
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.240]   >>John You know, it's just a way of mathematically
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800]   representing how much information is contained in the state of the system. How many numbers
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.840]   do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing? So in classical mechanics,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.280]   I give you the location of something by giving you three numbers, right up, down, left, X,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.760]   Y, Z coordinates. But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical state,
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.940]   which means both its position and also its velocity. The velocity also has three components.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.280]   So its state lives in something called phase space, which is six dimensional, three dimensions
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.000]   of position, three dimensions of velocity. And then if it also has an orientation in
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.480]   space, that's another three dimensions and so forth. So as you describe more and more
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.720]   information about the system, you have an abstract mathematical space that has more
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320]   and more numbers that you need to give and each one of those numbers corresponds to a
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.680]   dimension in that space.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.580]   >>Kaiper So in terms of the amount of information,
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.300]   what is entropy? This mystical word that's overused in math and physics, but has a very
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.220]   specific meaning in this context.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.460]   >>Zakaria Sadly, it has more than one very specific
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.620]   meaning. This is the reason why it's hard. Entropy means different things even to different
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.940]   physicists. But one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.300]   about the state of a system, right? So if I have a bottle of water molecules, and I
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.700]   know that, okay, there's a certain number of water molecules, I could weigh it, right,
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.340]   and figure out, I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and pressure and things
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.020]   like that, I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.660]   right? So there's a certain amount of information I know, certain amount that I don't know that
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.040]   is part of the complete state of the system. And that's what the entropy characterizes,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.340]   how much unknown information there is, the difference between what I do know about the
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.860]   system and its full exact microscopic state.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.860]   >>Kaiper So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.260]   system, is it infinite or finite but very large?
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260]   >>Zakarai Yeah, we don't know. That depends on the
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.740]   system. You know, it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.540]   infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. So let's go back a little bit.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.780]   We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived. For
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.300]   different systems, that will be different sizes. They could be infinite or finite. So
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.820]   that's the number of numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.900]   give me about the system. So the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of that system
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.260]   could be, depending on what I know about it. If I don't know anything about it, then it
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.180]   has a huge entropy, right? But only up to the size of its Hilbert space. So we don't
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.020]   know in the real physical world whether or not this region of space that contains that
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.340]   water bottle has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy. We have different
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.700]   arguments on different sides.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.660]   >>Steve So if it's infinite, how do you think about
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.900]   infinity? Is this something you can, your cognitive abilities are able to process? Or
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.740]   is it just a mathematical tool?
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.740]   >>Zakarai It's somewhere in between, right? I mean,
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.060]   we can say things about it. We can use mathematical tools to manipulate infinity very, very accurately.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.820]   We can define what we mean. For any number n, there's a number bigger than it. So there's
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.020]   no biggest number, right? So there's something called the total number of all numbers, that's
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.620]   infinite. But it is hard to wrap your brain around that. And I think that gives people
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.520]   pause because we talk about infinity as if it's a number, but it has plenty of properties
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.300]   that real numbers don't have. If you multiply infinity by two, you get infinity again, right?
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.140]   That's a little bit different than what we're used to.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   >>Steve Okay, but are you comfortable with the idea
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.260]   that in thinking of what the real world actually is, that infinity could be part of that world?
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.860]   Are you comfortable that a world in some dimension, in some aspect-
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.100]   >>Zakarai I'm comfortable with lots of things. I mean,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.220]   you know, I don't want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world. You
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.300]   know, I'm pretty open-minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.380]   >>Steve Yeah, but infinity is a tricky one. It's
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:40.260]   not almost a question of comfort. It's a question of, is it an overreach of our intuition? It
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.180]   could be a convenient, almost like when you add a constant to an equation just because
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.420]   it'll help. It just feels like it's useful to at least be able to imagine a concept,
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.060]   not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels like it's a description of the
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.060]   real world.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.780]   >>Zakarai Think of it this way. There's only three numbers
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:10.060]   that are simple. There's zero, there's one, and there's infinity. A number like 318 is
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.820]   just bizarre. You need a lot of bits to give me what that number is. But zero and one and
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.860]   infinity, once you have 300 things, you might as well have infinity things, right? Otherwise,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.540]   you have to say when to stop making the things, right? So there's a sense in which infinity
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.100]   is a very natural number of things to exist.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.540]   >>Kamala It was never comfortable with infinity because
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:40.420]   it was too good to be true. Because in math, it just helps make things work out. When things
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.540]   get very large, close to infinity, things seem to work out nicely. It's kind of like,
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:54.540]   because my deepest passion is probably psychology. And I'm uncomfortable how in the average,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:03.300]   the beauty of how much we vary is lost. In that same kind of sense, infinity seems like
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.140]   a convenient way to erase the details.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.500]   >>Zakarai But the thing about infinity is it seems to
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.060]   pop up whether we like it or not, right? Like you're trying to be a computer scientist,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.740]   you ask yourself, well, how long will it take this program to run? And you realize, well,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.000]   for some of them, the answer is infinitely long. It's not because you tried to get there.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.940]   You wrote a five-line computer program. It doesn't halt.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.700]   and I think I'll see you in the next video.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.520]   Bye.
