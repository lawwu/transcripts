[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   Well, the Lord loves to stop human boasting, as John Piper explained in a sermon on Romans
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.300]   chapter 11, verses 17 to 22.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.000]   The sermon was titled, "Continue in the Kindness of God," and preached in February of 2004.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Here's a short clip of what John Piper said about how we escape the trap of human boasting.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.120]   We have to believe that in the kindness of God, and in eternal life, and in justification,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.060]   and in his working everything together for good, the ultimate essential good of the gospel
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.080]   is God himself.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.800]   And the ultimate thing for which we believe him is that he will be for us an all-satisfying
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920]   treasure.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920]   It amazes me.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.160]   It amazes me about my own life, and it amazes me about churches, that we can preach the
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.520]   gospel and not think about what makes it good news ultimately.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.360]   We use words like forgiveness of sins, or justification, or salvation, or reconciliation,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.960]   or propitiation, or atonement, or ransom.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.280]   None of those is the end point that makes salvation good news.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   Why do you want to be forgiven?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.980]   Because it feels good not to be guilty or to escape hell?
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.540]   Those are both true and desirable.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.340]   But that's not what makes it good news.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.360]   What makes forgiveness good news is that it gets out of the way everything that keeps
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.880]   you from enjoying God.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.240]   Because the only ultimate joy that fully satisfies is God.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.520]   Everything Jesus did on the cross, everything he did in rising from the dead, everything
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.720]   he did by way of illustrating his character in doing miracles, in loving people, in getting
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.800]   his arms around kids and lepers, was to show us that in the end our satisfaction is going
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.400]   to come from being near him, knowing him, loving him, delighting in him.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   He is the end of the gospel.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.880]   If we don't penetrate through eternal life and penetrate through kindness and penetrate
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.300]   through justification and penetrate through Romans 8.28, to him, how is he honored?
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:43.640]   So my fifth point about what we trust Jesus for is we trust him to be a treasure to us
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.880]   that is infinite and all satisfying.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:59.960]   Father, please, there's only one ultimate escape from boasting, and that is the brokenhearted
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.720]   enjoyment of the God of grace.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:17.520]   So break our hearts for our sin and grant everyone in this room to taste grace, to taste
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.200]   Christ, the God of grace.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320]   Amen.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.360]   And this short clip was sent to us by Eric Dewar.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   Eric said this, "This is one of my favorite answers to the question, 'What makes the gospel
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.880]   good news ultimately?'"
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   Amen.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   It's a gem, Eric.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   Thank you.

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.120]   It's a doozy of a question for Pastor John.
