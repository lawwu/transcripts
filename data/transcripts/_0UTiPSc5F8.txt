[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.420]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue,
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.920]   our show where you send us the questions,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.660]   we try to provide some context, some research,
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.780]   maybe some answers if we can.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.980]   Remember our email is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.420]   Today's show brought to you by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.180]   Duncan, my one rule of thumb when it comes to investing,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.140]   if you don't understand something, don't invest in it.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.620]   So we've been talking about Innovator ETFs
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.100]   to find outcome strategies.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.980]   I think some people probably don't understand these.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.060]   Like what are the outcomes?
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.940]   So Innovator has this education tab on their website
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.820]   that walks you through the options.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.900]   So they have these basically four different kinds
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.580]   of options strategies you can do.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.900]   So one is a cap, which means you're capped out
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.700]   at a certain return on the upside,
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.280]   hopefully to get some downside protection.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.860]   The other one is they have enhanced funds,
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.540]   which could give you the two to 3% of the upside
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.780]   of the stock market.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.820]   Then they have their buffer ETFs,
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.820]   which provides a return range.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.340]   So hopefully like a downside and then an upside.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.180]   And then they have a floor,
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.500]   which means a level that the portfolio
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.420]   won't be able to be below an outcome period.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.500]   So they have all these things you can look at
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.740]   and you can click on each one of these tabs
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.900]   and it shows you kind of on the graph how it works.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.940]   So anyway, they have this huge education tab
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.760]   on their website.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.840]   They have all these videos.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.140]   It's worth checking out if you wanna understand
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.980]   more about these.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.060]   To learn more, visit innovatoretfs.com.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.100]   All right, Duncan, we've got some questions today
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.020]   that deal with people who have a decent amount of wealth
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140]   in their life and they still have problems
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.780]   and they're worrying about what to do.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.040]   And I think some people look at these kinds of problems.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.380]   You have a seven figure portfolio,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.700]   you have a 50% savings rate or whatever.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.540]   What's wrong with you?
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.540]   Why are you complaining?
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.420]   And I get that sentiment,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.340]   but also as someone who's worked
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.700]   in wealth management long enough,
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.340]   I know that there's a psychological component
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.140]   to people who have a decent amount of wealth in their life
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.300]   and still can't force themselves to spend or enjoy it.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.100]   And as a financial advisor, it's bizarre,
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.420]   but that is almost part of your job
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.820]   is to help people enjoy their money a little bit.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.980]   So I just wanna warn people,
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.700]   there's a couple not to brags on here.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.660]   People still have problems,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.140]   but everyone has their own cross to bear.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.100]   - Also, I don't know if you know,
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.000]   but there are plenty of wealthy people who are miserable.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.460]   - It's true.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.480]   I do know that.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.260]   Listen, follow billionaires on Twitter.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780]   I know, none of them are happy.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.900]   All right, so let's do the first one.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.100]   - Okay, so first we have a question from Gabe.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.760]   We're used to seeing financial planning advice
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.900]   based on a constant savings rate over long periods of time,
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.620]   but I'm trying to reconcile this with the realities of life.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.500]   For context, we are a married couple in our mid thirties
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.240]   who strive for a savings rate of 30% of gross income.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.580]   Prior to becoming parents and purchasing a home,
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420]   ages 30 to 35, we were living significantly below our means
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.260]   and had a savings rate of 40 to 45%,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.160]   far above our 30% goal.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.020]   However, after purchasing a home and paying for childcare,
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.660]   our savings rate has dropped to 20 to 25%,
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.020]   and we were feeling guilty about this
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.940]   because it feels like we have succumbed to lifestyle creep.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.500]   Is this just a natural shift
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.680]   where the savings rate drops
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.940]   until children attend public school?
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.860]   We're curious to hear how savings rates evolve over time
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.860]   with life events,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.340]   and want to make sure we stay on the right path.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.180]   - I love this. - It sounds like
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.300]   they've done a good job overall.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.660]   - Yeah, I love this question.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.920]   They seem to have things figured out pretty good.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.540]   This doesn't sound like lifestyle creep to me.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.660]   This sounds like life.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.340]   This is kind of what happens, right?
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.280]   No one saves a certain percentage of their income
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.900]   starting at age 25 and saves until they're 65,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.860]   that same exact amount,
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340]   because life doesn't work in a linear fashion like that.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.860]   That's only in personal finance books and fire blogs, right?
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.900]   Life is messier than that.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.100]   So Fidelity put out this report a few years ago,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.900]   and they really got online people angry with them.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.760]   John, let's do a chart on here.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.500]   Fidelity did this study, and they said,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.740]   "Basically, we figured out if you're gonna retire at 67,
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.040]   "you need 10 times your current income."
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.220]   And they said, "All right, along the way,
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.840]   "at 30, 35, 40, 45, this is how much you need to save."
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.880]   And so I think they said,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.520]   "If you're 30, you need to have one times your salary,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.500]   "35, two times."
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.080]   And people got really, really mad about this.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.240]   Now, they get to this answer by assuming
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   you save 15% of your income beginning at age 25,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   invest more than 50% in a stock portfolio,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.080]   and then maintain your pre-retirement lifestyle
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   in retirement.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960]   That's a lot of assumptions,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.280]   and they even give some caveats on here.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   People, of course, no one really read this study,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   maybe except for me, and they use a lot of assumptions,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.080]   but it's important to remember that it's never this easy.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.300]   Everyone's life is way messier.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.940]   You change jobs, you make more money, you make less money,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.660]   you get a bonus, maybe you get laid off,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020]   you move into a house, you have kids,
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.620]   you have unexpected expenses,
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.060]   you have healthcare scares, all this stuff.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.580]   Like, there's gonna be things that happen in your life
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.300]   that cause your savings rate to fluctuate, good or bad.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.140]   The first house I lived in came with an unfinished basement.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.260]   We spent a year finishing the basement.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.980]   It was expensive, and my savings rate dipped because of it.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.340]   I've mentioned this many times on the show.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.780]   People are probably sick of me talking about it.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.900]   We had three kids in daycare for two years.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.340]   My savings rate got, it suffered quite a bit from that,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.180]   'cause it was expensive.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.300]   This person's dealing with that, too.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.980]   I think the good thing is,
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.820]   it sounds like they're over the hump for these big things.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.140]   Once you're in a house and you fix your payment,
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.500]   you can kind of plan better, right?
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.240]   Obviously, a house is,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.780]   there's other expenses that come along with it,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.480]   but taxes don't move up all that much from year to year.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.900]   It's pretty, it's below 2%, I think, for most places,
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.460]   and your mortgage payment's fixed.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.500]   Hopefully, you got in under 4% or something
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.260]   before rates shot up too high,
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.660]   and if not, maybe you can refine this in a few years,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.940]   but now you can plan a little better,
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.840]   and you know that in four to five years,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.660]   the kids are gonna go to preschool and kindergarten,
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.780]   and when that happens,
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.660]   you're effectively giving yourself a raise,
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.220]   and the good thing about fixing your house payment is,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.140]   it's not like rent, like you, sorry, Duncan,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.900]   don't mean to twist the knife in the wound here,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.500]   or salt in the wound,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   but that fixed payment is gonna be,
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.620]   that's something you can plan on now,
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.160]   and if you make more money over time,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.420]   if your mortgage payment is fixed,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.380]   hopefully, you can increase your savings over time,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.220]   and that helps.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.140]   I still think that, it's probably what happened was,
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.700]   40 to 45% is probably too high,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.380]   especially for someone in their 30s,
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.980]   that's probably too high of a savings rate.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.500]   You should be enjoying yourself a little more,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.640]   and the good thing is,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.500]   you left yourself a margin of safety,
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.980]   where you were able to go from 45% to 25%,
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.300]   and that's still higher than, I don't know,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.060]   98% of the population in terms of a savings rate,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.460]   so I think you're probably just fine here,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.180]   because you gave yourself that margin of safety,
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.620]   and you can always probably slowly tick it up over time.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.820]   I've mentioned on the show a few times,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.060]   my goal for most people is just to get it to double digits,
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.980]   but life is messy like that,
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.320]   and it's gonna ebb and flow,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.740]   and go up and down based on what happens,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.740]   but I mean, if I just rented and didn't have kids,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.120]   could my savings rate be way higher?
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.820]   Sure, but that's not the life that I've chosen to live,
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.560]   so it kinda depends what you're trying to do here.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.700]   - Yeah, and I mean, we're the compound,
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.580]   so I feel like we'd be remiss not mentioning,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.020]   it sounds like they did a smart thing
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.780]   by saving a lot earlier on, right?
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.100]   And so now, given that,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.140]   something in the market that can compound, which is nice.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.620]   - That's a good thing, because saving more early,
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.060]   we've looked at the examples of this, right?
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.580]   Saving more early can help you later on,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.840]   because you get the compounding wind at your back,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.020]   so that happens.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.820]   All right, people are saying
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.420]   that I look like a grizzly bear with my beard.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.900]   - I like it, I think it looks good.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.140]   - Do grizzly bears have this kind of white
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.980]   in their beard like me?
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.540]   I don't think so, all right.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.220]   Let's do another one.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.860]   Okay, up next, we have a question from John.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.100]   I heard Michael say recently
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   that he had moved all of his cash on Marcus
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.700]   to a municipal bond ETF.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.760]   Moving from a 1.6% yield to a 3.5% makes sense,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.360]   but what about the total return?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.540]   If rates keep rising,
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.180]   then the principle of those bond funds will go down.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.920]   I've been buying a short-term bond fund recently,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.060]   but the return continues to go down
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.420]   because of rising rates.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.020]   With an online savings account,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.140]   you don't have that problem.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.940]   Should I move all of my online savings to short-term bonds?
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.820]   Am I missing something?
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.580]   My math is always so confusing to me.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.180]   I have so much trouble with this.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.180]   - Well, here's the thing.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.660]   All else equal, short-term bonds should protect you
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.660]   more against rising rates than long-term bonds.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.380]   Long-term bonds are getting hammered right now.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.860]   Short-term bonds are getting hit a little bit.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.620]   John, do a chart on here.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.060]   This is two different short-term bond funds.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.340]   Vanguard short-term bond fund and iShares,
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.780]   one to three-year treasury bond.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.780]   And this is their drawdown since the start of the rate rise.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.580]   So you can see the Vanguard one is down 6%,
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.900]   iShares is down 4%.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.980]   The reason for that difference is
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.940]   Vanguard holds some corporate bonds.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.220]   I think 25% of the fund is in corporates
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.140]   and other types of bonds,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.060]   whereas the iShares one is just strictly government.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.620]   And so that's kind of the difference there.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.500]   But short-term bonds do protect you
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.060]   more against rising rates than long-term bonds.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.900]   But you're still gonna have some interest rate risk
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.820]   if money, if rates rise.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.540]   That can't be, sorry, that's never gonna go away
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.580]   unless you're ultra short.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.540]   And that's what online savings accounts effectively are.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.000]   There's no interest rate risk.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.540]   But the trade-off here is what do you want more,
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.660]   yield or safety?
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.540]   With an online savings account,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.580]   you're going to get more safety
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.780]   'cause there is no interest rate risk.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.820]   They can lower and raise the rates,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.740]   but they're not gonna be affected by bond yields changing
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.220]   and the prices changing.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.160]   So if you want no interest rate risk,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.140]   put it in an online savings account,
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.900]   maybe a CD, because you know what that rate's going to be.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.740]   And if you're willing to accept
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.140]   some minor fluctuations in prices
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.180]   and you want higher yields, that's the trade-off.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.900]   So you could get three to 3.5% right now
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.580]   in a short-term bond fund,
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.900]   whereas I think the range for online savings accounts now
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.140]   is something like 1.75 to two, probably,
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.380]   depending on where you get it.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.140]   Ally, SoFi, Capital One, all those different places.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.780]   You can chop around a little bit.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.220]   So that's the trade-off.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.220]   Are you looking for that yield that's higher
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.200]   and also gonna lead to some price fluctuations?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.020]   Or do you want the safety of no interest rate risk
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.200]   and you're gonna have to accept a lower yield?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.660]   That's a trade-off.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.700]   - Do you think we'll see,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.700]   you were talking about this on yesterday's Animal Spirits.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.700]   Do you think we'll see some regulation at some point
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.860]   on banks mandating a certain yield spread or something?
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.580]   'Cause you were talking about what they're getting
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.380]   and then what they're giving to the consumer
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.780]   is very, very different.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.680]   - No, probably not.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.820]   I don't think they-- - Probably not, okay.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.320]   - No, the banks probably have enough money to,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.580]   they can set the rates whatever they want.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.260]   If they have enough deposits coming in,
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.580]   it's basically a function of deposits.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.220]   Banks have so much money in deposits,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.060]   they don't have to pay out
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.860]   high rates of savings right now.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.420]   Someone showed actually a conversion
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.860]   on Twitter this morning saying,
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.580]   "When the Fed funds rate was this high in 2018,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.660]   "the online savings accounts
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.180]   "were like 25 to 50 basis points higher."
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.220]   So they've just kind of decided,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.060]   "Hey, you know what?
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.640]   "We're not gonna raise the rates as much.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.780]   "We have enough demand.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.620]   "We have enough deposits.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.460]   "We're fine.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.280]   "We don't need to pay."
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.540]   So when they need to bring more money in,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.380]   then they raise the yields.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.620]   It's kind of a function of supply and demand
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.020]   more than anything.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.840]   - Gotcha.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   Makes sense, I guess. - Let's do another one.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.420]   - Okay, so up next we have a question from Tim.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.100]   Okay.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.120]   I'm 50 years old and in my peak earning years.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.980]   However, the pandemic has made me rethink
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.380]   my retirement plan.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.300]   I want to move to a low-cost country
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.520]   where my parents live.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.880]   They're in their 70s and relatively healthy.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.060]   I want to spend more time with them
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.580]   before they become too old to do anything.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.700]   If I sell my house now,
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.180]   I will have roughly $2 million
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.180]   between my 401(k), IRA, and brokerage accounts.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.020]   I intend to implement a three-bucket strategy
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.100]   with most equity investment and index funds.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.780]   My living expenses in the low-cost country
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.260]   will be about $20,000 a year,
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.980]   assuming no big surprises.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.380]   I already bought a small condo there.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.020]   I also plan to incur $20,000 of taxes per year
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.440]   to do a Roth conversion after I retire.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.500]   You're gonna have to explain that part.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.020]   I have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   I may move back to the U.S. after 10 to 20 years,
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   but it's difficult to predict the exact timing.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.340]   I'm a bit scared to pull the trigger
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.700]   seeing the current market volatility
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.020]   and knowing I won't get another job
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.900]   with the same salary if I quit now.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.020]   What are your thoughts?
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.220]   What am I missing in my plan?
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.100]   All right, so this is another lifestyle question.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.260]   And again, someone might look at this and say,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.220]   "Oh, you have $2 million.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.020]   "Boo-hoo, tough choice."
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.980]   But it's a choice nonetheless.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.300]   This is a big shift, obviously.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.780]   And I think good on this person
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.140]   for choosing family over work.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.460]   I actually find that very noble.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.280]   Here's the thing.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.360]   I think if you make this type of move,
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.680]   you have 10 to 20 years to figure something out
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.540]   and think about your next step, that's a very long time.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.540]   And you're worried about finding another salary.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.100]   Who knows what your life is gonna look like then?
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.760]   And it's possible with that much money,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.660]   you may not have to find another job.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.500]   You have plenty of time here.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   So the fact that your living standards
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.900]   are gonna drop so precipitously
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.720]   for moving to a low-cost country,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.000]   that helps you a ton.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.460]   So $20,000 to live.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.740]   I don't wanna get into the tax stuff.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.260]   They're talking about doing a Roth conversion.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.140]   They're following the Bill Sweet plan here.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.700]   They're taking some of those traditional IRA or 401(k)
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.780]   balances and converting them to Roths.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.700]   I'll leave that one to Bill someday.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.940]   But I mean, I guess I don't know
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.180]   what the career has to be here,
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.860]   but remote work probably makes it easier
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.340]   than ever to find something.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.180]   But even if you don't,
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.280]   you're still with $2 million at age 50, you're fine.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.300]   So if you take 20K out of a $2 million portfolio,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.060]   that's 1% spending rate.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.500]   That's absurdly low.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.540]   And again, life doesn't happen in a straight line,
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.180]   but let's do a simple straight line calculation here
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.180]   because it's just easier.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.000]   So I know why they do that.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.260]   So let's say you take that 20K
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.100]   and your lifestyle is gonna increase more than you think.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.540]   So let's put in a 5% inflation rate every year, right?
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.780]   For spending because who knows what's gonna happen
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.220]   and maybe you just wanna enjoy yourself a little more
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.060]   in this new country.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.560]   So I'm building in a margin of safety.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.020]   And let's assume you're investing this money
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.440]   relatively conservatively in your bucket.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.500]   So we're only gonna assume a 4% annual return, right?
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.700]   I'm being very conservative here
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.060]   because I wanna leave a margin of safety
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.700]   if they're not gonna be working.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.700]   And actually with bonds at 3% now, a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.540]   Duncan, what would you have to earn
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.780]   in the stock market to get a 4% return?
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.260]   Do some math.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.580]   Is that Gal Panaka's gift?
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.420]   - I have no idea.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.020]   - Four and a half percent in the stock market.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.420]   It's not that bad.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.100]   So if you took that $20,000 out initially in year one
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.740]   and then increased it by 5% every year,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.740]   so you're spending like $250,000 over 10 years,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.900]   you still have a portfolio worth $2.6 million
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.540]   after 10 years with that growth, only 4%.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.500]   And what if you were able to find a job in that place
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.300]   that could cover your cost of living, $20,000, right?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.280]   It might be a part-time job even.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.500]   You leave your portfolio alone, earns that same 4%,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.100]   you're close to $3 million now.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.540]   20 years, if you do the same thing,
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.020]   spend that money each year, take that 1% out
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.420]   and increase it by 5% for inflation,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.780]   you're gonna have $3.6 million after 20 years.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.620]   If you don't touch it,
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.780]   you're gonna have more than $4 million.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.520]   So this person, they've already saved enough
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.340]   to put themselves in such a good position
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.460]   that no matter what they do, they'd be fine.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.980]   They might never have to find a job again,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.280]   depending on their level of spending,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.300]   if and when they decide to move back to the US.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.060]   I'm sure this is the kind of move that's pretty scary,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.180]   but it sounds like they're doing it for the right reasons
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.180]   and also in a good financial position to do it.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.500]   So it sounds to me like they're gonna be okay.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.700]   And I think, again, depending on what the career is,
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.940]   a potential remote work could make it
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.900]   so they could bring in enough income on the side
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.580]   to cover those small living expenses
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.820]   and be fine and leave that portfolio alone for a while.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.420]   Duncan, question for you.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.300]   How far would 20,000 a year get you in New York?
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   Is that like Tuesday night happy hour once a week?
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.220]   - No, I mean, it's at least three or four months of that.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.540]   - Okay.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.380]   All right, but I think this person
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.860]   is probably in a better situation
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.220]   than they realize, especially,
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.580]   'cause this is like geographic arbitrage, right?
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.060]   They have a lot of money, they're selling their house,
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.100]   they're probably selling it for a decent chunk of change,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.340]   and they're moving to a place with a low cost of living.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.780]   This is the dream for a lot of people.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.900]   - Do you have any guesses on where they're moving?
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.260]   - A bunch of people say Central America
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.340]   or Mexico in the comments.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.540]   That makes sense to me.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.900]   - So I saw recently on a list for the number one
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.740]   best place to retire is Portugal.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.860]   So I wonder, Portugal's, I mean, relatively low cost
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.260]   compared to a lot of places.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.300]   - Well, right now, the Euro's going down,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.020]   the dollar's going up for right now, that might work.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.060]   But yeah, I'm guessing it's somewhere
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.960]   in like Central or South America.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.800]   - Right. - All right,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.980]   let's do another one.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.820]   - Okay.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.380]   So up next, we have a question from Adam.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.980]   A substantial portion of my wealth, 30 to 50%,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.660]   is going to accumulate in public company RSUs
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.060]   over the next few years.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.540]   But my company is down like every other one right now.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.300]   My original plan was to hold the stock for a few years,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.060]   let it recover, and pay long-term capital gains.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.140]   But now I'm wondering if I'm putting half of my eggs
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.740]   in one basket and it would be better to just accept
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.980]   the debt in RSU value and sell right away
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.340]   to convert to a broad market index fund
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.460]   and pay short-term capital gains for selling RSU grants
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.580]   as I get them to buy the dip in the overall market.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.580]   And for our young and new investors,
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.260]   maybe explain what an RSU even is.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.420]   - All right, restricted stock unit.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.700]   We get a lot of questions about this.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.020]   And it's actually more complicated than you'd think.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.780]   So let's bring an advisor in here
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.180]   who actually has dealt with this with a number of clients.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.540]   Please welcome to the show our very own Joey Fishman.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.300]   Joey's an advisor here at RWM out in Oregon.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.140]   - Hey, Joey.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.200]   - See, his background looks just like Duncan's in Brooklyn.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.040]   You can tell.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.460]   So Joey, you've dealt with a number of clients
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.900]   that have this situation where a majority
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.780]   of their net worth is going to be in their company.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.220]   That could be a terrible situation if something goes wrong
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.340]   because not only is their income tied up there,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.760]   but potentially their net worth.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.500]   So how do you think about this in terms of,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.060]   I know I need to diversify here,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.340]   but I also have to deal with taxes
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.180]   and all this other stuff.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.540]   So how do you start off on this
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.340]   when planning something like this?
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.820]   - Yeah, let me just sort of like restate Adam's question
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.820]   to help sort of simplify,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.860]   'cause it sounds like he's getting part of his compensation
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.160]   includes RSUs or equity compensation.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.460]   And so he's not accumulating these RSUs,
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.980]   he's being granted them as part of his compensation.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.500]   And so it sounds like the sum total of that comp
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.180]   of those RSUs are 30 to 50% of his total net worth.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.220]   And at the same time, each time that they vest,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.420]   they're vesting into a down market.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.100]   So instead of like trying to triangulate a strategy
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.940]   for Adam here, I think the better approach
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.400]   is to look at the three considerations
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.980]   that Adam probably needs to first discuss.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.200]   And that is, A, is he saving enough?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.100]   Like is he maxing out his 401k, his HSA, his IRAs,
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.900]   his taxable accounts in a way that's still keeping him
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.780]   on track so if these shares get vaporized,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.060]   he's still on track to meet his retirement goals
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.420]   and objectives.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.020]   The other thing to think about for Adam
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.180]   is that losses typically hit multiple times harder
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.120]   than the joy of gain.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.740]   And so if he's vesting into a down market,
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.020]   I mean that the value of these shares are declining
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.340]   each and every day.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.620]   So that in and of itself is hard to stomach.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.620]   And then the other component is being exposed
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.820]   to this much equity comp and this much of your net worth
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.100]   tied up in a single stock.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.020]   Is it putting you in a position where you're gonna,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.660]   you know, a position of empowerment or strength?
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.180]   And the reality is is that, you know,
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.680]   most folks that we work with, I'd say that they sell
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.900]   about 90% of their RSUs as they vest.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.020]   And the remaining 10%, we either have an edge
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.880]   or we just wanna fish and cut bait.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.460]   The other thing that Adam may just wanna consider
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.580]   if he hasn't really done a full on financial plan
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.300]   is maybe just figuring out, you know,
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.700]   at what point or at what age
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.140]   does he wanna have enough money
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.860]   so he doesn't have to worry about working again.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.140]   Maybe not retirement, but just at that age
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.260]   when he's gonna have enough money,
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.180]   he doesn't have to worry anymore.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.020]   Maybe that should be the mark of, you know,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.940]   maybe that should be the goal if he doesn't have
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.340]   like a family and figuring out all those long-term.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.940]   - So most people you work with,
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.980]   they wanna sell right away because they say,
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.940]   I know what this value is now.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.780]   I don't know what it might be in three, six, nine, 12 months.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.620]   So I wanna just take what I have now.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.860]   I'm not gonna have to worry about it
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.020]   and let it hang over me.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.340]   And then they have that 10%,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.500]   which we've talked about in the past
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.260]   as like almost like a fun account where you're kind of,
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.900]   so that gives you a little bit of upside
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.740]   if things turn around and go well for that company, right?
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.580]   - Absolutely.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.300]   And you know, look, if Adam's gonna continue to work there,
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.540]   and especially if he's gonna hold out long enough
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.020]   to go through the entire vesting period,
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.420]   which is about four years,
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.020]   he's probably gonna get an equity refresh anyhow.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.420]   So if he sells, you know, what he's got now into weakness,
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.020]   what's to say that the next grant
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.060]   isn't gonna be at higher prices?
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.540]   - Right, so he's, it sounds like a problem,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.180]   but in a pretty good position here
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.220]   because there could be more of that backfill along the way
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.460]   if he misses out on some gains
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.140]   if the stock market comes back.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.900]   - Yeah, he's in a great spot, he really is.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.460]   - All right, we have another one.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.380]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.820]   - I was gonna say, I wouldn't worry so much
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.220]   about the tax consequences in this scenario.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.140]   It's, you know, it's not the worst thing in the world
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.340]   to have an accumulation of tax loss carry forwards
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.820]   that you can then use down the road
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.100]   to neutralize capital gains.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.260]   So I think Adam's better off figuring out
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.700]   like what his goals and objectives are
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.620]   and letting, and not letting the tax component
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.460]   mag the dog.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.260]   - Well said.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.420]   Okay, let's do another one, which is kind of similar,
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.380]   but in a different company environment.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:19.060]   - Okay, I'm an employee at a private startup.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.180]   The company is in its growth phase, series C or D,
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.660]   and I've vested almost all of my stock.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.540]   I'm in my 30s, earn a little over $100,000 a year,
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.220]   single with no kids.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.460]   I have no debt and saved about $180,000,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.020]   mostly in index funds.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.780]   My dilemma is that I don't know how much
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.900]   of my stock options I should exercise.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.460]   I've already exercised some,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.220]   but there's a lot left on the table.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.140]   The cost of exercising wouldn't be that much,
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.220]   but I believe the tax bill could be very significant,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.300]   potentially tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.180]   Depending on the current valuation of a company,
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.780]   or yeah, depending on the current valuation of a company,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.140]   if the company has a decent exit,
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.300]   I stand to make at least a few million dollars,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.340]   but if the company goes under,
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.140]   the shares and tax burden of exercising
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.460]   wouldn't change my lifestyle,
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.420]   but would definitely sting quite a bit.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.940]   There's no science behind this,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.300]   but gut feeling is that there's a 60% chance
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.180]   this company makes it to IPO.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.380]   Any advice for startup employees like me?
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.100]   The whole system is ridiculously opaque
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.220]   for anyone not on the board,
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.540]   and advice on this topic is all over the place.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.860]   Unless I can sell some shares,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.140]   which requires board approval to cover the tax burden,
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.900]   then it seems like the only choice here
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.180]   is to either leave money on the table,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.020]   or take a significant amount of risk.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.340]   Are there any other paths I'm overlooking?
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.860]   - Okay, see, I told you this stuff was complicated,
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.260]   and I think with a startup, it's even more complicated.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.340]   The funny thing is, 15 months ago,
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.500]   I'm sure there was a lot of startup people
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.220]   just counting their money,
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.220]   and just waiting for the IPO to happen,
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.660]   or some sort of liquidity event,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.540]   and they were ready to buy houses, and Lambos, or whatever,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.420]   and now their shares are probably down 80% or something,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.260]   and this person says,
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.620]   "Well, I still think we'd get to an IPO,"
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.940]   so what do they have to do here?
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.700]   Because the last question we were talking about
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.220]   was someone who works for a public company.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.300]   Now, public companies can go to zero.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.460]   It's happened before.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.500]   Typically, it doesn't happen overnight.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.140]   A startup could get vaporized overnight, almost,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.220]   or you could lose your jobs. - Absolutely.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.420]   - So this person is saying,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.220]   "Listen, if I take these stock options,
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.660]   "and I pay the taxes on them, it could still be worthless,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.540]   "and then I paid taxes, and now it's not worth anything,
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.980]   "so I'm getting screwed twice,"
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.980]   so what did the thought process look like here?
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.420]   - This is a hard one.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.540]   Private companies are especially hard to work with.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.380]   It's kind of like winning the financial lottery,
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.620]   only you can't access the money
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.060]   until you circumvent this needle threading
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.700]   and obstacle course in order to actually have access to it,
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.260]   so this is one area where, in financial planning,
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.700]   it's long on tactics, but it's really short on logistics,
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.540]   and I think our friend here,
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.420]   we'll call him private company friend,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.500]   I think the point with which they should start taking action
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.780]   is when they know for sure that it's gonna IPO
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.020]   because the two objectives that they should have
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.460]   is A, figuring out ways to avoid AMT taxes,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.940]   which potentially could present themselves,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.020]   and then also, they wanna start the process
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.300]   of beginning qualifying
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.500]   for what's called a qualified disposition,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.380]   and in that scenario, essentially, our friend here
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.500]   would be able to liquidate his or her shares
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.260]   at a preferred tax rate.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.060]   The challenge with doing this or embarking upon this strategy
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.460]   has been just what you articulated,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.820]   it's like, "Look, I could be converting
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.740]   "or exercising these shares, paying taxes on it,
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.380]   "only to see that money that I laid out
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.420]   "being completely vaporized."
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.260]   So what I like about this person's situation
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.740]   is that they make $100,000 a year.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.860]   I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.780]   just to see like, okay, hypothetically,
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.500]   if they were to have an exit
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.900]   and they were to have to pay AMT taxes,
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.940]   look, at the end of the day,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.900]   if there's a $2 million exit
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.020]   and this person walks away with 1.1,
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.340]   that's like 11 times their annual spending,
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.180]   so I guess what I'm saying is that
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.660]   I wouldn't let the uncertainty of it all overwhelm you.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.580]   I think I would really keep it simple,
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.060]   find someone to work with that can help take apart
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.460]   the actual tax liabilities.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.060]   That, actually, that's the easiest part to do,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.580]   dealing with the uncertainty of the various paths
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.180]   with which this company could exit, could IPO.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.340]   - But you're saying if they have time
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.100]   to wait a little longer,
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.660]   depending on when they have to exercise these options,
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.100]   that makes sense because then you can get
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.420]   a little more certainty beyond that 60%,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.060]   or whatever they're thinking right now.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.860]   - Yes, because they're so far down the road,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.500]   like they're on series C or D,
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.300]   so they're pretty far down the road to go in towards IPO.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.100]   It's late in the game, so my sense is that
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.900]   when those shares were originally granted,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.780]   it was probably at a really low-cost basis
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.100]   relative to the value of the firm.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.060]   I'm sure now that they've had multiple rounds
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.100]   over and over again,
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.940]   the firm's value has increased significantly,
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.580]   so when they do go to exercise those shares,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.620]   they've been granted, essentially,
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.740]   the opportunity to pay $10,000
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.900]   for $100,000 worth of value.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.020]   So in that scenario, they're gonna owe taxes on 90 grand
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.140]   because that's the spread between the current value
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.980]   versus what the share price is.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.540]   - And the other thing, the roll of the dice,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.820]   if there's ever a person who's ready for a roll of the dice,
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.340]   it's someone who's making six figures, no kids, no debt,
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.460]   so it would obviously still sting if this went badly,
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.900]   but you're in a position, as a young person,
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.220]   and you already took a risk
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.020]   by working for a private startup,
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.580]   to take that other risk and then see the,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.260]   the asymmetry is to the upside here, if things go well.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.100]   Like, your downside is capped, your upside is huge.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.220]   Like, the downside compared to the upside,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.180]   that's, we're not talking--
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.020]   - Not necessarily.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.060]   - Down subprime back here.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.140]   - Yeah, not necessarily.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.860]   I mean, if they go for a traditional IPO,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.660]   those shares are gonna be locked up for six months.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.500]   Chances are, the value's gonna get absolutely shellacked
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.060]   after it does IPO, and then when the lockup comes,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.140]   they could be realizing those shares
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.540]   at a significantly depressed value
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.220]   versus what it was pre-IPO.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.980]   - Joey, Duncan is holding out for growth stock comeback here.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.820]   (laughs)
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.660]   Have a little faith that some of those growth stocks
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.820]   on the IPO are actually gonna do well for once.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.180]   - Okay, that's the other thing, too,
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.060]   is you don't wanna look at the last 10 years
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.340]   and use that as your benchmark,
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.860]   or as your frame of reference, like this next decade--
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.900]   - But yeah, but this whole process,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.780]   this is like a shameless plug
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.540]   for the wealth management industry,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.980]   but because this is such a stressful process,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.260]   this is why you want someone working with you
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.020]   that can help you work through something like this
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.660]   and think about the different paths forward.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.260]   - We've taken this apart six ways to Sunday,
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.780]   and the reality is there's no direct path
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.820]   towards saying this is the specific strategy
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.460]   that you can undertake.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.340]   Instead, it's going to be very much dependent
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.860]   upon the facts on the ground at the time
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.820]   with which the liquidity is going to be available to you,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.660]   and then making the decision then, unfortunately.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.540]   - Yeah, I'm a little confused just reading the question.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.940]   I can't imagine if I had a job at a startup
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.780]   and I was offered all this.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.740]   - There are some startups that are helping out
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.820]   with this kind of stuff now, but this person is right.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.220]   There is not a lot of help for people on the ground,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.940]   especially who are just,
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.820]   people think of the CEOs of these places
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.780]   who are gonna be fine either way,
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.860]   but the regular rank-and-file employees
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.540]   who could be making a life-changing amount of money,
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.740]   it's not easy for them.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.820]   - When a lot of times-- - It's super frustrating.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.620]   - It's a significant portion of our comp, right,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.460]   at a lot of these companies.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.420]   - Yeah, yeah, that's the upside thing, yeah.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.260]   All right, Duncan, let's do one more on our favorite topic
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.100]   on portfolio risk.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.380]   - Yeah, I was so excited to see iBonds.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.940]   I'm still waiting on us to get a sponsorship from iBonds.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.100]   (laughing)
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.500]   Okay, so up last we have Amy writing,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.240]   this year is the first time my husband and I
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.780]   have ever invested in Series I savings bonds,
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.220]   but the $10,000 limit is kind of a bummer.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.140]   We don't have any kids yet.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.180]   Are there any other ways we could get around this limit
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.340]   to put more money into these bonds?
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.380]   - All right, Amy's been paying attention here.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.900]   We've been talking about this a lot.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.740]   We've covered in the past
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.820]   that you have this $10,000 limit.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.140]   If you have kids, you could do one for each of them.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.020]   Joe, you've looked into this.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.180]   What are some other options here
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.420]   if they want to get that sweet,
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.740]   what is it, 9.6% right now, annualized?
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.540]   - Yeah, 9.2%, something like that.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.340]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.260]   There's two things that need to happen with Series I bonds.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.300]   One is that we need to raise the fixed rate.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.900]   We have to find a way to lobby Yellen
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.540]   to raise the fixed rate.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.460]   And then the second thing, they need to,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.620]   they should definitely raise the amount of limit,
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.340]   you know, the contribution limits.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.020]   - Yes, raise the cap to 25 grand, come on.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.420]   - Yeah, at minimum.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.700]   For these folks, just to sort of like reiterate,
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.140]   if you have, you know, an individual social security number,
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.140]   you're allowed to buy $10,000.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.940]   If you file your taxes and the IRS owes you
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.660]   up to $5,000 per entity or per spouse,
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.380]   you are allowed to take $5,000 from your refund from the IRS,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.740]   have it sent to Treasury,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.220]   and Treasury's gonna then issue $5,000
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.260]   or up to of Series I bonds.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.900]   They're gonna be paper bonds.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.460]   You'll have to go through the process
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.900]   of changing those paper bonds to electronics.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.300]   That's a little bit arduous.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.540]   It's not surprising if you've dealt
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.500]   with Treasury direct sweats.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.300]   - How many years will that take for you to receive this?
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.380]   - No, it's actually, it'll come fairly quickly.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.500]   It's the actual process of converting them
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.100]   from paper to electric.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.860]   That's the one, or electronic, I should say.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.420]   That's the one that takes a while.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.860]   So, you know, between the two of them,
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.420]   they can be doing $30,000 a year.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.180]   The other entities that are probably more accessible
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.180]   to them is single managed member LLCs.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.540]   You know, trust irrevocable or revocable
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.060]   are both eligible to open up Series I bonds accounts.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.100]   You know, Bill Sweet and I,
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.340]   and actually Bill Artsaruna and I,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.740]   we've had a lot of discussions about this.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.900]   You know, if this person has a hobby,
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.740]   I think her name is Amy.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.660]   If Amy has a hobby where she ekes out
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.820]   just a little bit of money or some kind of business from it,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.780]   I mean, technically she could open up an LLC,
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.420]   use whatever income that's fed through that hobby
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.380]   to afford the cost of opening up an LLC.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.220]   - As long as you have like the what, the EIN number?
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.060]   As long as you have one of those, you can-
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.100]   - EIN number, exactly, exactly.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.500]   Now, in the state of California,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.980]   it's $800 to incorporate or to open up an LLC.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.100]   That's egregious.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.940]   It's gonna be hard, I think, to execute
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.860]   on opening up a single managed member LLC.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.700]   - I think I pay like 170 a year to keep my LLC going.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.540]   - In Michigan, yeah. - In Michigan.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.780]   - That sounds about right, yeah.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.260]   So it depends on which state you live in,
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.180]   but if it's relatively inexpensive to incorporate
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.700]   or create an LLC, why not?
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.580]   - Yeah, okay, yeah.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.940]   It would just be nice if they said,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.340]   you know what, we're gonna throw people a bone
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.180]   and just for a year or two because inflation is so bad.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.020]   But- - Yeah.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.660]   - And the kids part of that question was,
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.020]   you're saying that, so people can buy in their kids-
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.220]   - You can buy in your kids, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.700]   - Okay, I see.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.060]   - There are some caveats,
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.380]   like if you're gonna use it for college
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.700]   and your income is within a certain threshold,
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.700]   there's a certain way with which you have to title
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.180]   the Series I bond so that when they take distributions,
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.160]   it'll be tax-free 'cause it's gonna then be used
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.800]   for educational purposes.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.420]   It's a little bit of a different conversation
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.100]   that requires more nuance, but.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.300]   - Okay, Joey, one more question from the chat here.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.060]   People wanna know, where are you calling in from?
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.900]   'Cause I see the beautiful background there.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.740]   Where are we at?
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.500]   - Bend, Oregon. - That's not Brooklyn.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.820]   - All right, so this is Bend, Oregon
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.300]   and I'm sitting on top of an eight by 10 trailer
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.640]   that's on, I think there's four wheels on it.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.180]   And so the reason that it's on a trailer
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.780]   is 'cause where it's presently parked
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.260]   is where a utility easement is.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.820]   So like, I'm sure you guys have all seen
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.660]   like those big green electric boxes outside,
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.880]   like on your front lawn.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.460]   I have something similar over here
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.460]   and the challenge was that the only place
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.540]   where I could put the office was where the easement is.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.500]   And so if the power company ends up needing
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.660]   to access this area, I just hook it up to the car
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.180]   and then pull it away. - You have a mobile office.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.700]   - A mobile office, yeah.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.660]   So my neighbor, Uncle D and brother Kyle
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.460]   are expert carpenters and so they did most of it for me.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.900]   I did the inside, but yeah, that's cool.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.260]   - Tiny houses or tiny offices.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.720]   All right, thanks to Joey for coming on
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.300]   and helping us with stock grants
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.780]   and Sears iSavings Bonds, we appreciate it.

[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.620]   Got some compound merch.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.900]   We have a new t-shirt, a chart on shirt.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.780]   I'm waiting for mine in the mail still, Duncan, it's coming.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.800]   I ordered it, it's not quite there yet.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.460]   There you go, a nice new shirt.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.260]   Very '90s, it looks like "Saved by the Bell" themed possibly.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.260]   - Yeah, we were talking like arcade,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.340]   like yeah, '80s, '90s arcade kind of vibe.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.180]   - I like it.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.480]   Keep those comments and questions coming.

[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.120]   (upbeat music)
