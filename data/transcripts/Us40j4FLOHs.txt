[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   password protocol is terrible with most people. Most people pick a easily decipherable, simple
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.520]   password because that's what they can remember, and they use it everywhere. And unfortunately,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.640]   what you have to understand is that even assuming that you had the most indecipherable,
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   sophisticated password possible, if it's been exposed as a result of a leak or a breach,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   then it's discovered. And a discovered password is no good to you anymore.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.120]   And if it's through your entire universe of websites, it's going to come back and be a
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.160]   nightmare for you. So you really have to think hard about the kinds of passwords you're going
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.520]   to use. In fact, that's why most people use password managers that want to simplify their
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   lives. But you need to do that because one ubiquitous password in your life is guaranteed
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.040]   to create a problem for you.
