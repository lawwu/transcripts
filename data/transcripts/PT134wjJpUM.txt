[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.040]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 183.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.960]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   Jesse, we weren't sure if we were even gonna be able
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.000]   to record this episode this week.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.360]   I have a crazy schedule.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.200]   It's not really crazy.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.520]   It's just a schedule that has me on campus
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.760]   most days, all days.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.880]   So it gets in the way of our podcast recording.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.920]   So we didn't even know if we'd have time
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   to record this episode.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.720]   So what we were able to do is we're squeezing this in.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.240]   We're doing a shorter form episode.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   Now, I always tell Jesse, people don't know this.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.920]   I tell him at the beginning of every episode,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.760]   we're gonna be quick today.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.200]   We never are, but today we have to be
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.680]   because we have an actual sort of Damocles time limit
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.820]   hanging over our head here.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000]   So we're gonna be quick, 45 minutes in and out,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   clean, we're gonna slip this in.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.920]   And then Thursday's episode, we're gonna do
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.320]   a classic episode from the vault.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.760]   So you will get to hear a classic episode from the vault.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760]   We didn't have time to record both,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.840]   but I think you'll enjoy it.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.320]   You know, Jesse, I'm noticing from my letters
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.040]   and the statistics, the statistics we get,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.000]   that there's a lot of people now who are going back
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.240]   to the beginning of the show and trying to work their way
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.080]   forward.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.920]   So more and more people, I would say,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400]   typically like, oh, these old episodes,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.640]   most people weren't around then,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.940]   most people didn't hear them, but people are going back
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.600]   and playing through the old catalog
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.880]   'cause we're honing in now on, I don't know,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.680]   say around 100,000 downloads a week.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.560]   But no one episode is ever gonna get more than
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.360]   20 something thousand downloads in a given week.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   So like, actually most of the downloads in a given week
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.380]   are not for that week's episode.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.840]   People that are doing the trip down memory lane,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.680]   but we'll select a good one from the archive
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.320]   to play for Thursday.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.600]   - I'm always a fan when you talk longer,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.120]   'cause I think your audience wants you to talk long
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   and wants to know what you have to say.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960]   That was always the case even before I started,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720]   you know, helping out with the show.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.560]   - Oh, I know, yeah.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.460]   I don't know if going shorter is good for the show.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.920]   That's just my schedule stress.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.960]   I'm always like, we're gonna get this thing down short,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.080]   we're gonna get the footprint small.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   I think in this fantasy world in which I just sort of like
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.960]   walk by the studio on my way to somewhere else
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.380]   and Jesse puts a mic in front of me
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.600]   and without breaking my stride, we do the episode.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.520]   No, I love it once we get going,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.640]   but whenever I'm moving around the Jenga pieces
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280]   on my schedule, I'm like,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000]   the more we can contain the recording,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.240]   the more time we have to do innovation and writing.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.800]   And so I always joke about that.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.840]   But today we actually are,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.280]   Joe the engineer is on his way.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.760]   We're fixing some of our sound issues.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.280]   So we have to be ready.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   We have to be ready.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.760]   So we're actually gonna stick to it.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.720]   We'll stick to it this time.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.160]   Before we get into the questions
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.720]   and I've narrowed it down to five,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.920]   we're doing five focus questions today.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   I thought we'd play a quick round of a new game show
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   I came up with, which is called,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.820]   Is This Crazy or Deep?
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.040]   All right, so you're the contestant, Jesse.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   I'm gonna explain one of the weird idiosyncratic things I do
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.960]   and you have to make the judgment,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.600]   is it like a cool example of deep living or is it crazy?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.520]   All right. - Let's go.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.720]   - All right, here we go.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.240]   So I was reading a book.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.120]   I was reading Thomas Merton's "The Seven Story Mountain"
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.200]   because I hadn't read it before,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.720]   but it's a very influential book,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.440]   especially for talking about the deep life
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.800]   and the things that we talk about here on the show.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.080]   It was a problem I had not read that book.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.740]   It's sort of an underground classic.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.040]   I don't know, have you heard of it before?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.440]   - You talked about it either last week or the week before.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.400]   So then I looked it up.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.220]   - There we go, okay.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.480]   So I talked about it before,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.080]   Jesse reminded me.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.080]   And it's this story, it's the memoir of this Thomas Merton
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.640]   who grew up actually this interesting lifestyle.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.040]   His dad was an artist and they traveled all over Europe,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.080]   but then he settled into a cosmopolitan life in New York
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.240]   and left it all to go to a Trappist monastery in Kentucky,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.880]   wrote this book about it in the '40s, 1948 it came out.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520]   And it was a big deal at the time
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   because the whole country was in this
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.400]   post-World War II malaise
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   where there was Korean conflict was starting to heat up
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.680]   and the war was over and there was economic issues.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.120]   It was before things really got fired up again
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.280]   and people had moved to the suburbs
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.720]   and were just marching to these sort of generic office jobs.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.360]   And this book landed in 1948 and was very influential.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   So I was like, I need to read this book.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.280]   So I was like, I forgot where I heard about it.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.120]   I was like, let's just read it.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.240]   I grabbed it on my Kindle.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.080]   And I was having a hard time making progress on my Kindle
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.680]   because it felt like the wrong format.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.560]   Because it's a 1940s mid-century book
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   that changed the zeitgeist and it just, I don't know,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   it wasn't feeling right on the Kindle.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   So I went down this series of escalating conclusions.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.000]   So the first conclusion was reasonable.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.920]   It was like, I'll just buy another copy of the book,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.080]   but a hard, like a real copy, just better than Kindle.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   And I do that actually semi-often.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   I just did that, I'm reading right now
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   John McPhee's "Draft No. 4,"
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.880]   which I started on Kindle and was like,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   I think John McPhee should be in paper.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   And so I bought the paperback too.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   But then I was like, you know,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.800]   I don't know if a paperback is gonna do justice
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.600]   to "Seven Story Mountain" because of the context.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   And he's a monk and writing it.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.960]   And it's like, maybe I should get an older hardcover copy.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.800]   And then I was like, you know,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.560]   if I'm gonna get a hardcover copy,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   you know, maybe what I really need
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.320]   is a first edition, first printing version of it.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   The first printing done in 1948.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160]   So the exact version of the book
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.040]   that someone would have held in 1948
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.720]   when it was first making its cultural impact.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.320]   And so I found a first edition, first printed copy
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.160]   at a rare bookseller in Canada and had it shipped down.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.000]   And I have it right here for the viewers at home.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840]   And if you're listening,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   you can go to youtube.com/cummingfordmedia.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.000]   And I got it, it arrived, right?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   First edition, first printing.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.440]   So it has the nice and empty,
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.360]   you know, the page where you have the printings
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.680]   is nice and empty.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   I love these mid-century fonts.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.640]   These are some of my favorite fonts.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.880]   It's a yellowed, good condition,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.760]   little bit of spine damage.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.000]   I paid well over $100 for this, Jesse.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.640]   So here's the question, deep or crazy?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.720]   - Deep. - Deep?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.280]   - 100% deep. - All right.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.920]   - 'Cause I mean, you could just put the other versions
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.040]   in the Deep Q library and then whatever.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   - But buying the first edition and spending three figures.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.680]   - You don't play golf, that's what you do.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   - All right. - You buy books.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.240]   - That's what I'll tell my wife.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.320]   Like, yes, this was expensive, but golf is worse.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.560]   - Golf's much worse. (laughing)
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.520]   - All right, I think, see,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.720]   I think this could be a hobby of mine, first edition books.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.880]   And I really love the idea that this was like the edition.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.120]   When this book first hit the cultural scene,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.160]   this is what it looked like.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.200]   This is what someone was holding in 1948.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.080]   - I mean, it just goes along with everything you talk about,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.920]   like setting the ritual of getting your mind right
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.840]   to do whatever you're doing,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.320]   and you're just trying to get through this book,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.160]   which you weren't doing when you were doing on the Kindle.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.800]   - Yeah, all right, so there we go.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.580]   Jesse says it's deep, so it is justified.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.720]   There's limits to the strategy.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.800]   So then I looked up some other books.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.920]   I was like, you know what would be really cool?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.520]   We'd have a first edition of this or that.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.040]   All right, you gotta be selective here.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.880]   - Some of them would get real steep, right?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.920]   - It gets pretty steep. - Yeah.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.720]   - So I was looking at Walden.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.900]   It's like, man, 18, whatever that is, 54.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.080]   First edition of Walden.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.000]   Now that is such an influential book
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.520]   on so many people that I followed and on my own work.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.680]   We're talking three large, at least.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.480]   So that was a limit.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.200]   I think we need a few more sponsors of the podcast
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.080]   before I get a drop three large.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.360]   - The Hedgehog Review, they'll pay for it.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.200]   - We're paying them.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.020]   You forgot, Jesse.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.120]   We're paying them because it would be too much
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.000]   of a whatever it would be,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.920]   submission to the capitalist overlords.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.520]   So we pay them to sponsor us.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.040]   So we'll get there one day.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.960]   When I start talking about a first edition of Walden,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.240]   then you know the show's doing too well.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.560]   All right, well, speaking of sponsors,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.720]   before we get to the questions,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.640]   let's make enough money to pay for this crazy book purchase.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.200]   And let's talk in particular about our good friends
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.640]   at Blinkist.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.380]   Blinkist is a longtime sponsor of this show,
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.760]   and for good reason.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.880]   Blinkist is a subscription service
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.560]   that gives you access to short summaries
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.180]   of thousands of best-selling nonfiction books.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.560]   These summaries, which are called Blinks,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.040]   you can read them in the Blinkist app
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   or on the Blinkist website,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.880]   or you can listen to them.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.940]   So you can take in that knowledge on the go.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.360]   As we've talked about on the show many times,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.080]   both I and Jesse use Blinkist.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.580]   The way I use it is to quickly assess a book.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.140]   Eight times out of 10,
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.620]   just getting the main idea from the Blinkist is enough.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.020]   I'm like, great, I know what I need to know from this book
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.160]   so I can be conversant with that idea.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.000]   I know what's going on in the cultural trends.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.620]   Two times out of 10, I say, you know what?
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.780]   I'm gonna buy this book now and read it in depth.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.740]   Blinkist helps me make that decision.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.900]   So it's a fantastic tool for anybody
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.960]   who is looking to navigate our current world of ideas.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.860]   I use it, for example, to make my way
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.940]   through Yuval Harari's library, Post-Sapiens.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.700]   I used a blink of Homo Deus and 21 Lessons
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.020]   for the 21st Century to figure out
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.940]   what's going on in those books,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.980]   which I needed to buy, which I didn't.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.360]   I ended up buying one of those and not the other,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.620]   but I will leave that as a riddle
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.260]   for you to guess which was which.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.040]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.180]   just for our audience.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.460]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.340]   to start your free seven-day trial,
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.740]   you will get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.940]   That's Blinkist, spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.540]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.500]   and a seven-day free trial, blinkist.com/deep.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.000]   We are also sponsored by Athletic Greens,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.740]   a product that I use every morning.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.100]   So you've heard me talk about it before.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.940]   Athletic Greens is a powder that you mix into water.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.100]   You mix it into 12 ounces of water each morning.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.740]   That powder has everything you need
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.060]   to be healthy in your diet,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.500]   including 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.940]   whole foods, sourced superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.340]   You just take it in the morning once a day
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.660]   and you are sure you are not missing something vital
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.620]   for your health and well-being.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.580]   The reason why I am an Athletic Greens fan
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.420]   is 'cause I talk to them.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.060]   Deciding whether or not I was going to let them
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.900]   be a sponsor of the show,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.940]   I talked to them and what really struck me
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.060]   and really impressed me is that they just do this one thing.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.580]   They do this product, AG1, it's called, their powder,
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.200]   and they improve it again and again.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.120]   So they don't do new products,
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.360]   they do new additions of their standard product.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.100]   They are obsessed about finding
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.380]   the very highest quality version of the ingredients.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.300]   They're obsessed about what form does this ingredient
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.320]   have to be in for it to actually be ingested,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.500]   for it actually to make a difference.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.700]   You don't have to worry about supplements and vitamins
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.220]   and having a whole cabinet full of these things.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.860]   You just trust Athletic Greens.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.020]   They ship it to you every month,
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.280]   you take it every morning, and you will be fine.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.780]   So right now it's time to reclaim your health
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.020]   and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition,
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.020]   especially now that we are still in flu and cold season.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.900]   It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, that's it.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.860]   No need for a million different pills and supplements
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.460]   to look out for your health.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.740]   So to make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.260]   a free one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.980]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.600]   All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.180]   Again, that is athleticgreens.com/deep
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.700]   to take ownership over your health
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.500]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   All right, doing good.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.480]   I'm checking our time, 45 minutes today.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.280]   You will see, you will be impressed.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.880]   This show comes in for a landing on time.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.220]   Let's do some questions.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.400]   Our first question here is from Madalena,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.160]   who says, "Are you familiar with
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.620]   "perfect practice makes perfect?
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.500]   "When it comes to knowledge work,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.480]   "how can we learn what perfect practice looks like
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.620]   "without practicing poorly for some time?"
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.240]   Well, Madalena, at a high level,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.080]   deliberate practice is the activity
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.360]   that makes you better at complex activities,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.740]   whether those activities are physical or mental.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.360]   So if you're gonna get better at a skill
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.960]   related to your knowledge work job,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.560]   you will be, you really whittle it down to its core,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.480]   need to do deliberate practice.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.360]   Now, I first introduced this idea
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.320]   on my blog and email newsletter years ago.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   I then generalized it and expanded it some of my book,
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.800]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.920]   where I talked about applying deliberate practice
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.320]   to knowledge work.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.280]   And I'll tell you, here was the complexity of doing so
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   is that it's not easy to translate deliberate practice
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.080]   from the domains where we know how to do it well
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.220]   to domains like an office job.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.440]   The issue was, and I get into this
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.280]   in "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.420]   I get into this in some of my articles,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.880]   is that if you look at, let's say, an athlete
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.120]   doing deliberate practice,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.760]   and that's an area in which they're very good
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.200]   at this technique,
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.560]   what you're gonna see is carefully designed exercises.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.600]   These are exercises that have been designed by coaches
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   and honed through years of experience.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.000]   This is the drill you need to do.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.440]   This is the weight you need to lift
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.680]   in this particular type of way.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.420]   And these exercises are done with direct feedback
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.360]   so that you're aiming yourself to be doing it just right.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.920]   And if you're getting off of the right way of implementing it
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.520]   you get pushed back to the right way of doing it
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.000]   because the way deliberate practice works
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.720]   is that you are stretching yourself
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   past where you're comfortable,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.520]   doing the thing right past the comfort level,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.060]   and you're hardening those neural circuits
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.000]   so that becomes easier.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.120]   So you have to be guided very carefully.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.620]   You have to be doing it right,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.160]   and you have to be pushing past where you're comfortable
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.200]   or there's no actual growth happening.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.080]   Well, how do you do that
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.820]   if you're the new associate marketing manager
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.020]   at a pharmaceutical company?
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.800]   How do you do that if you're a computer programmer?
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.860]   How do you do that if you're a young professor?
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.060]   There's no coach,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.660]   there's no one there to run you through drills.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.220]   So I got really into this question.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.260]   After So Good They Can't Ignore You came out,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.140]   I got into this question
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.180]   because I was designing this online course
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.500]   with my friend Scott Young
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.140]   that eventually was called Top Performer.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.920]   And at the core of this online course,
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.620]   Top Performer was let's teach you
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.740]   how to do deliberate practice in the workplace
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.580]   'cause this is what people wanted more details on
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.980]   after reading So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.180]   So So Good comes out in 2012.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   We launched the first version of this course in 2014,
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.380]   and we have had thousands of students.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.360]   I forgot the exact count,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.380]   but it is multiple thousands of students
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.980]   go through this course over the years since then,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.980]   and we keep evolving it.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.500]   So that experience has really helped us
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.940]   get hands-on knowledge
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.540]   about how do you make deliberate practice work
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.980]   in the knowledge work environment.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.700]   And I don't mean this to be a plug for Top Performer.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.580]   It's not actually open right now.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.460]   We typically just open it once a year.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.380]   I think I have a link
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.000]   where you can find out more on my website,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.200]   but it's not like it's open right now
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.660]   I'm trying to get you to sign up for Top Performer.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.700]   I'm just saying this was the foundation of me learning
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.920]   about how do you actually make these principles work
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.540]   in the office.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.100]   Here's three things we learned.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.440]   One, identifying the skill
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.420]   that you want to deliberately practice
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.540]   is often not obvious.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.140]   This was a surprise to Scott and I
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.500]   when we were working with real students
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   in all these different industries
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.540]   is that they didn't know what they should get better at.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.780]   Knowledge works jobs these days can be quite ambiguous.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.700]   It's kind of amorphous.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.620]   I don't know, I'm on email.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.020]   I'm involved in a lot of different things.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.740]   There's a lot of different things going on.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.420]   And I can't tell you exactly what I do here.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.740]   I don't shoot baskets.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.180]   So I can't tell you what it is I'm trying to get better at.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.140]   So identifying the skill that actually matters
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.980]   is complicated.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.500]   And what we ended up eventually recommending people do
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.980]   is pretend to be a journalist.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.260]   I'm gonna go out there and discover
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.500]   what are the skills that matter in my field.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.420]   And you're gonna do this by interviewing people
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.540]   who are more successful than you in your field,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.340]   but not just successful in a generic sense,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.100]   but successful in the sense that
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.620]   something about their status in your field,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.540]   what their work is, their position is,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.740]   what they do on a day-to-day resonates.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.580]   There's a target.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.860]   If I could get to where Bob is,
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.060]   the way he's here half time and he's a consultant
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.740]   or he's the CFO or whatever it is,
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.380]   but you have someone like that's where I wanna get,
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.780]   there's my aspiration.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.740]   You interview them.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   Can I talk to you about your career?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.540]   Over coffee or whatever.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.460]   And then when you interview them,
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.660]   this is the other critical thing we learned,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.780]   do not ask them for their advice.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.860]   I'm telling you this as someone who writes advice
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.780]   as a professional.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.220]   This is what I professionally do for a living.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.620]   People when put on the spot are terrible
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.540]   at giving you advice.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.780]   It is a fraught, stressful situation
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.860]   when you say, what's your advice?
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.860]   And what people will do is their mind will seize on,
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.940]   we need something that is coherent and sounds smart.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.700]   And it doesn't matter how real it is or not real it is
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   or how important it is or not important it is,
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.900]   they will fix on something
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.660]   because you have to deliver some advice in those situations
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.780]   or they will use it as an excuse to give a implicit sermon
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.340]   about something they don't like about kids these days.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.700]   But what you're rarely gonna get is actually good advice
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.860]   because good advice is hard to develop.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.900]   It's a scale you have to get good at
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.700]   and you have to actually look at a lot of data
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.700]   and really get a sense of what matters and what doesn't.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.260]   So what should you do instead?
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.860]   Ask them for their story.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   I wanna know beat by beat how you move through your career.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.460]   All right, when you got from here to here,
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.220]   when you got this first big responsibility,
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.140]   what was the thing that allowed you to make that step?
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.580]   And if possible, ask them this question
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.660]   in a differential way.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.180]   There was other people in your same position.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.460]   You're the one who got promoted to be editor.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.260]   What do you think you were,
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   what was it that you were doing different
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.820]   than the people who didn't get promoted at that point?
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.140]   So you're really trying to understand
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.660]   at every step what mattered.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.020]   And then you go back and think about what you learned
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.380]   like a journalist, like an advice guide writer.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.940]   And you say, what's the important pattern in here?
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.780]   Oh, this thing came up again and again.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.860]   These other steps forward were generic
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.900]   like most people could make them,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.300]   but this is where the big leap happened
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   is because he was good at X.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.540]   And that X now is a skill you've identified
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.940]   as being really important.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.660]   So yeah, it's a pain that it's not obvious
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.020]   to identify what skills matter,
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.780]   but it's also a good thing
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.700]   because no one else is gonna do this effort.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.340]   No one is gonna take people out for coffee.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.420]   No one else is gonna interview them like a journalist
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.380]   and go back and try to extract what really matters,
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.460]   not just what they want to matter.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.780]   No one else is gonna do this.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.980]   So advantage to you.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.180]   All right, the second thing that matters
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.900]   for deliberate practice and knowledge work,
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.180]   the best way Scott and I could figure out
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.340]   to design practice activities
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.980]   is to suggest that you commit yourself
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.620]   to a project carefully designed
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.340]   to require you to stretch your ability
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.540]   on the skill in question to complete.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.260]   I cannot complete this project
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.060]   without getting better at this core skill that I identified.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.620]   Project-based skilled improvement seems to be the best.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.700]   We ended up at some point completely redoing
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.260]   that top performer course to be built completely
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.020]   around a project you identify and try to work on
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.180]   because it was too hard to improve these skills
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.420]   in the abstract.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.620]   You need a public commitment to this project.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.140]   So you've told your boss, they're expecting it.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.980]   Someone's waiting for it.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.220]   Someone's going to evaluate it.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.980]   If it's bad, they'll be upset.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.340]   You need those public stakes
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.660]   'cause that's gonna simulate the coach feedback.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.740]   It's gonna push you, okay, I'm gonna push myself
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.860]   to try to stretch and do well
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.740]   because I don't want to embarrass myself.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.140]   I don't wanna renege on the promise I made to my boss.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.260]   I don't wanna upload this thing in the GitHub
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.260]   like I claimed I would and have people laugh at the code.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.900]   So publicly commit to a project
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.700]   that will force you to stretch with the skill in question.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.460]   It's the best we could come up with
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.580]   for simulating the type of practice
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.780]   a coach would run you through for another type of skill.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.180]   And then finally, put aside regular time for this
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.700]   or have a scheduling philosophy that makes regular time
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.580]   same time, same place, the same day
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.700]   for working on this project.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.540]   So it's a protected thing.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.380]   Just like if you're training,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.900]   I gotta get back in cardio shape for spring training,
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.180]   you're gonna have regular times
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.340]   you're out there doing cardio.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.580]   You don't just leave it up to,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.260]   hey, if I'm in the mood to run
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.620]   as a professional baseball player, I'll go for a run.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.180]   It's no, I do my runs at this time on these days.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.860]   So you put those ingredients together,
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.140]   a well-identified skill
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.980]   designed with a publicly committed project to stretch it,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.060]   executed in times that are set aside and protected
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.260]   like a dentist appointment or parent teacher conference
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.140]   with your kids that time is unviolatable.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.420]   Do those three things, Madalena.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.340]   You can in like a three or four month period
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.700]   become significantly better at something
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.460]   that's gonna have a significant impact on your career.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.700]   All right, so I appreciate that question
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.380]   because I've thought a lot about that.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.420]   All right, so we got here next,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.980]   we have a question from Charles.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.660]   This is a question that will get my fellow nerds
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.180]   in the audience fired up.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.900]   The same people that ran me over the coals
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.980]   for missing out Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rufus.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.580]   The same people are about to get upset again.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.460]   So beware, Jesse.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.500]   Charles says, "Kel, does the experiential difference
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.740]   "between writing code in a modal editor like Vim or Emacs
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.980]   "versus doing so in a GUI editor
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.100]   "like MFT Visual Studio or Eclipse
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.780]   "inform your thoughts about context continuity
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.060]   "versus context shifting?
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.500]   "Your views on context inform any best practices
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.820]   "for using source code editors?"
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:49.020]   I'm gonna send that as a book proposal to my agent.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.820]   Just because I think it'd be funny
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.580]   if I was like, "Lori, I've got a great idea for a book.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.900]   "I'm gonna blow the lid off
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.180]   "the contextual context continuity impact
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.660]   "of modal source code editors
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.540]   "versus GUI source code editors.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.540]   "We are gonna blow the roof off this thing.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.300]   "Think like Seymour Hersh,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   "but like if he was a really specialized computer programmer."
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.500]   I think she'll enjoy that.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.780]   Speaking of, okay, and Charles,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.860]   I'm gonna get to this in a second.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.460]   And audience, I'm gonna generalize it
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.740]   to not be about source code editors,
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.340]   so don't worry about this.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.220]   But speaking about sending agents bad proposals,
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.060]   I appreciate it.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.260]   I was listening to an interview with Michael Pollan
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.340]   and he was talking about his agent
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.060]   who is supposedly famously brash or blunt.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.620]   And he was talking about years ago,
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.580]   Pollan had written "Second Nature,"
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.860]   his first book, big success.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.820]   They gave him a big advance for a second book.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.660]   Second book becomes "Place of Your Own."
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.540]   I like "Place of Your Own," but it didn't do well.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.460]   It was about architecture and him trying to build a cabin.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.940]   So his third book is really important
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.580]   because at this point he had left his editorship at Harper's
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.460]   and was making a go at being a full-time writer.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.420]   And they left New York
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.860]   and moved to a dilapidated house in Cornwall,
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.300]   Connecticut, like all the stuff I love.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.660]   And so this third book needs to be good.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.300]   And he sent a pitch to his agent that was about,
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.100]   he was gonna move to Celebration, Florida
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.900]   and live there for a year and be like,
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.180]   what's it like living in this weird plastic,
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.660]   you know, fake, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.620]   And he says his agent called him,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.220]   didn't say hello or hi, Mike, or whatever,
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   just started going, "Boring, boring,"
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.220]   until he got the hint.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.940]   So I think I would have that reaction
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.940]   if I pitched a book on source code editors.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.820]   All right, but Charles, let me get to your question.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.140]   You know, by the way, I was asked this question,
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.060]   a version of this question,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.260]   my interview at Georgetown a decade ago,
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.300]   not modal versus GUI, but within the modal world,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.340]   I was asked VIM or EMAC.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.020]   So it's like a, it's a key question.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.740]   And the thing is the answer I gave them,
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.820]   which is the answer I will,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.260]   the immediate answer I'll give you, Charles,
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.420]   is that I'm a theoretician.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.580]   So I don't know.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.300]   I don't write code.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.580]   I mean, I know how EMACs works, but I don't write code.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.420]   I don't do useful things with computers.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.620]   I solve theorems.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.620]   And so I'm worthless to that.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.900]   But there is a more general question lurking
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.460]   that I find really interesting,
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.340]   which is when we're talking about software tools,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.940]   writ large, there is a tension
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.780]   that I don't think we understand or talk enough about
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.900]   between easy and effective.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.660]   So for non-computer code people,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.580]   these modal editors like VIM or EMACs,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.100]   like in particular VIM are not easy to use.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.060]   You know, it's a, they're line-by-line editors,
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.340]   they're text-based and yeah, EMACs is a little easier,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.780]   but with VIM, you know, if you wanna write,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.860]   like you actually have to do a command
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.280]   that says I'm inserting text right here,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.540]   like a keyboard command.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.100]   So it's not just a GUI, like Microsoft Word type editor,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.420]   and you have to memorize lots of complex key combinations
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.940]   to do almost anything.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   But it's this very direct connection between like,
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.420]   I wanna put this line of code here now, good, and locked it.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.240]   Now I wanna do this.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.700]   Like it's very bare bones, but powerful,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700]   but you have to know what you're doing.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.580]   It's very intentional.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.820]   And then there's these modern code editors
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.540]   like Visual Studio or like Eclipse,
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.860]   which are like Microsoft Word on steroids.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.660]   It's everything is visually around your code
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.860]   and all the different files that are dependencies
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.780]   while you're writing code.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.920]   It's trying to make suggestions
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.340]   about what you're trying to type and underline things.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.620]   Like, could you put better code here?
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.220]   I can automatically fill this in for you.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.700]   Like, it's all about making the individual things
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.660]   you might do as a coder as easy as possible
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.420]   in terms of like reducing friction
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.620]   and making everything visual and available.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.940]   And there's a big war,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.660]   Charles calls it an editor war about these things.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.060]   But we see the same issue in a lot of software.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.060]   A shift away from software that is focused like a laser
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.060]   on doing one thing towards these sort of bloated packages
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.500]   where everything is possible
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.980]   and there's all of these automated tools
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.620]   to sort of help you and hold your hand and pull you along.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.140]   You should be able to just sort of stumble
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.020]   into the software and pretty quickly be able
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.220]   to make some progress.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.660]   So I think about easy as meaning the software
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.100]   simplifies the energy and concentration required
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.140]   to execute individual desired actions
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.520]   while effective means the software is lined up
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.040]   with the way your brain operates
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.760]   to try to extract as much value as possible from your brain.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.920]   I don't care if it's easy,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.200]   what's gonna let you write the best code in the end?
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.660]   I think easy is overrated, effective is often ignored.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.800]   I think we need more effective software,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.040]   software that is pared down, software that does one thing,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.720]   software that has a high learning curve.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.120]   But if you learn that curve,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.600]   if you actually follow that curve,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.120]   you're able to really intensely extract value
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.960]   out of your brain.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.040]   If you look at a product like MATLAB or something like this,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.240]   you know, it's kind of a pain to learn how to use MATLAB,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.320]   but for mathematicians or physicists or engineers
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.360]   who learn it well,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.420]   they can extract a lot of value out of that tool.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.800]   That is effective software.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.120]   Trying to have something that just makes it natural
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.040]   and easy to fall into everything else,
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.240]   I'm less impressed by, I'm less impressed by.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Because here's the thing,
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.360]   and this is maybe a slow productivity principle
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.900]   being applied to software,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.720]   trying to get rid of little bits of friction, who cares?
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720]   Right?
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.600]   We're not computer chips,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.240]   where what matters is how many op codes
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.320]   we can execute per second.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   We're not, we're gonna make more money for our company
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.440]   if I can do 15 quick things instead of 10 quick things.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.800]   Like all that really matters in the end
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.960]   is what have I produced a value and how quality is it?
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.760]   What is the value of the things I produce?
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.840]   And that is often something
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.280]   where friction could be beneficial.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.680]   Having to slow down, take things step by step,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.240]   laboriously move things from here to here,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.280]   that could be actually what you need to do
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.800]   to produce the best quality thing.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.720]   So why is easy more and more what we see,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.840]   especially in business software?
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.720]   Well, I think it's overload.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.880]   I think in a world of chronic overload,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.000]   where we all have more on our plates
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   than we know what to do with,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.280]   we've created this weird simulacrum of work
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.000]   in which all we do is try to get through little things
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.760]   as quickly as possible and get that churn rate up.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.920]   So all we don't want any friction,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.480]   we're just emails back and forth.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.400]   I got to print this thing.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.680]   Let me grab this PowerPoint slide.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.520]   Let me expand that.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520]   Can I shoot that over here?
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.320]   Can I do a quick invite for people to come share
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.160]   this Google doc because that'll save me some time
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.000]   versus actually sending it to them one by one.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.080]   It's all about just churning
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.520]   through overhead activities quickly
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.680]   because we're overloaded
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.280]   and there's more than we know what to do with
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.120]   and we're stressed.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.960]   And the only metric we have for progress
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.040]   is we're churning through things.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   But in a world without chronic overload,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.440]   I'm working on one thing at a time.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.880]   I don't have too many things on my plate.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   And I don't care if it's slow
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.520]   to change the format of this thing.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.760]   I don't care if it's slow to get a copy
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.920]   to the three people that need to see it.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.960]   Who cares?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   Is the thing I'm creating really good?
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.680]   And so effective is not the same as easy.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   And I think that is a principle
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.520]   that we need to think more about.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.320]   And if we embrace slow productivity in general,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.640]   then this is a specific consequence
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.680]   when we look at the world of software.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.920]   So I like old school software.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.240]   You know, John McPhee has this crazy old software
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   called K-Edit that he uses to write his articles.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.840]   And he explains it in draft number four.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.360]   And it's like them.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.240]   It's this weird, there's no formatting,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.840]   no balding, there's no underlining
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.320]   or searching or grammar checks.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.720]   And you like, it's a line by line editor
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.240]   and you have to learn these key commands
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.360]   and it's monochrome as far as I can know.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.080]   And he has an old unsupported version
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.800]   he runs on like a Windows machine
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   and nothing about it is fast, but it matches his process.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.680]   And nothing about his process is fast.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.240]   He spends a long time writing his pieces, right?
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.920]   And we look back at him and say, he's very productive.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.800]   So effective is not the same as easy.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.640]   I don't know.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.600]   I think we get that wrong.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.240]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.840]   All right, 31, doing well.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   Let's do a question here from Matt.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.480]   Matt says, like many of your listeners,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.980]   I'm a pastor of a small to medium-sized church.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:28.920]   Sometimes leading this can be a Herculean task.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.640]   Beyond your go-to productivity staples,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.600]   like capture, time blocking, daily, weekly
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.200]   and quarterly planning, what would be your best bits
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.360]   of advice for juggling the people and planning demands
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.520]   that come with being a church minister
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.720]   with very few paid staff?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.520]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.440]   And at the risk of mixing metaphors,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   I hope you'll be the Athena to my Odysseus.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.840]   Well, Matt, I think there's a lot of people
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.880]   in your situation, not necessarily a pastor
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.940]   of a small church, but someone in charge
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   of a modest size organization in which they do not have
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.540]   a lot of administrative or support staff to lean on.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.600]   So a lot of things fall on their shoulders.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   So it is very easy in that situation
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.440]   to get overloaded and overwhelmed.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.120]   So how do we get out of that beyond just tuning up
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.640]   your productivity, multi-scale planning,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.840]   the stuff I normally talk about,
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.980]   the stuff I talk about in my time management core ideas
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.720]   video, what else matters when you're in this situation?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.420]   I'm in charge of a lot of things, I'm overloaded.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.160]   All right, so there's two things I'm gonna recommend
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.560]   that you add to your toolkit here, Matt.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.700]   One is to get more of an obsession about context shifting,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.180]   especially when it comes to dealing with people.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.720]   So dealing with your parishioners,
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.660]   dealing with the various committees
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.080]   that help run the church,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.300]   moving away from a environment in which communication
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.000]   is ad hoc and unscheduled.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.080]   'Cause you have a lot of people
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.320]   you have to communicate with.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.100]   You have to be in touch with your flock, so to speak.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.600]   You have to be in touch with the other people
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.940]   who help run the church.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.920]   You don't have the ability to say,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.240]   I don't do that anymore, I'm not there for my parishioners,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.600]   I'm not gonna talk to the stewardship committee.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.320]   No, you have to talk to all these people.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.260]   If it's ad hoc and unscheduled,
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:19.200]   you will be forever context shifting, forever.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.500]   I have to get back to my email,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.380]   there's asynchronous back and forth conversations
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.720]   happening that I have to keep moving,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.060]   my phone is ringing, people are stopping by.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.940]   And in that flurry of unpredictable
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.060]   but constant context shifts,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.640]   you're gonna feel completely overloaded
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.320]   and as if you're never making progress
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.120]   on anything of substance that you're stuck
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.560]   in a whirlwind of distraction.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.680]   So what you need to do is consolidate those context shifts.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.720]   You're not gonna reduce the people you talk with,
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.080]   you're not gonna reduce what it is that you offer
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.120]   to those who need you,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.180]   but you are going to consolidate when this happens.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.600]   You're gonna do this through well-advertised processes.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.740]   Now I can give you some off the top of my head suggestions,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.960]   but you're gonna have to customize this
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.340]   for your own situation.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.840]   But now you might have twice a week
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.320]   parishioner office hours where you can come to my office,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.840]   I have Zoom on, I have a chat open, this is it,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.760]   and I wanna hear anything, any issue you're having,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.000]   any question you have, anything you want guidance on,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.480]   Tuesday, Thursdays, let's go.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.160]   Parishioner office hours, or maybe Sunday after services too
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.360]   there's a two hour window there.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.680]   You're taking a lot of necessary communication
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.600]   with your parishioners and now consolidating it.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.440]   Are they gonna be upset?
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.480]   No, they want clarity.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.960]   Clarity is better than accessibility.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.440]   Oh, great, it's a Pastor Matt.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.360]   Yeah, so I'm gonna swing by his Thursday office hours
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.240]   because I wanna tell him about this thing I'm worried about
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.320]   or get his advice on this,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   or I'll give him a quick call at that time.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.340]   You also should use a scheduling tool.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.840]   So when something requires a longer one-on-one conversation,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.580]   have some blocks of time split up into half hour slots.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.680]   And when your stewardship committee,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.320]   your youth director, the assistant pastor,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.880]   like needs you and need to talk something through,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.320]   you're like, grab, yeah, absolutely grab a slot.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.780]   Grab a slot, you know the link, grab a slot, let's talk.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.160]   I'm here, I wanna look you in the eye.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.840]   You can even use a justification here,
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.040]   like, look, I'm a leader of this organization.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.200]   I wanna be here to help people.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.300]   I wanna look you in the eye.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.560]   Like, let's get out of email.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.240]   Let's sit down in my office and we'll talk things through.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.560]   It'll actually make you seem more accessible,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.800]   but you're consolidating.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.880]   And all of that asynchronous back and forth communication,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   drop-ins and random calls that are requiring 15,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.960]   20 contact shifts every six to 10 minutes
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.120]   throughout your day, all of that goes away.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.400]   And now there's just periods where you're in your office
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.600]   and you're like, I'm just, people are here,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.000]   people are coming in and I'm working on shallow stuff
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.660]   when people aren't here.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.360]   It's predictable, you know what's gonna happen.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.780]   People feel like there's structure,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.440]   people feel like there's control,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   but you're not constantly running around.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.080]   So I think that's gonna make a really big deal.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.200]   Two, I'm gonna suggest be very wary about chronic overload.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.360]   So you're gonna get the sense of chronic overload,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.920]   that despairing feeling when your mind perceives
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.440]   there's more things it needs to plan for and execute
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.380]   than it can easily imagine doing.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.800]   So you wanna fight against chronic overload.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.560]   And to do that, a few tricks you can do
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.800]   if you can't just drastically reduce what's on your plate
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.840]   is one, you can, to the extent possible,
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.600]   automate regularly occurring small things.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.400]   This person does it, this system does it,
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.000]   I always do it in this half hour on these days.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It doesn't make those tasks go away,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.200]   but it takes it out of that status in your brain
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.840]   where you feel like you have to plan and make a,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.300]   or it's gonna require a plan,
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.920]   it's gonna require you to think about at some point.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.980]   It changes it from an open loop to a background activity.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.840]   If you walk your dog every morning before you go to work,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.440]   you don't think about walking your dog
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.620]   as one of these things on your plate
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.520]   that you have to schedule, it's just something that you do.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   So you automate to the extent possible the small things
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.400]   so they can't lay claim to the planning portion of your brain
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.960]   and say, I don't have to worry about that,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.200]   that's taken care of.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.400]   For the large projects, you have to be way more careful
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.000]   about being sequential about these.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.320]   How many large projects can you actually handle at a time
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.280]   and stick to that?
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.320]   You can have a big queue of them,
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.240]   but you say I only do two at a time
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.760]   and I have two going on right now.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.180]   So yes, I love this project, but it's on my queue
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.120]   because I can only do two big things at a time, right?
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.680]   So these are the type of things you need to do.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.540]   And then for the medium size, one or two week long projects,
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.720]   again, throw processes at it.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.240]   If you have a meeting with a committee
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.420]   and you're gonna revamp X, here's how we're gonna do it.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.360]   Make a plan for it so it's not ad hoc
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.920]   back and forth communication.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   These things are gonna help.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   The final thing, Matt, which is specific to your position
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.200]   that I'm gonna recommend is one day a week
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.480]   or at least one half day a week,
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.760]   but I would prefer one day a week that's your sermon day,
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.320]   sermon reflection contemplative day.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.740]   Just work backwards from that goal.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.400]   Hey everyone, Fridays, I'm not on screens,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.520]   I'm thinking and writing about my sermons,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.200]   I'm walking, I'm reflecting, I'm reading,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.600]   I'm bettering myself and my soul
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.140]   so that I can better serve the flock.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.900]   I think it's a great example.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.000]   You do it on Saturdays, this is when God said to rest,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.180]   you're gonna rest on a Shabbat day.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.480]   I think that's gonna be a great example
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   for the congregation.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.760]   You can work around losing that one day
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.000]   with all the stuff I talked about
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.360]   and it's gonna refresh you,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.840]   it's gonna make you better at what you do,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.420]   it's gonna keep you connected to why you do it.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.160]   So I know that might seem radical,
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.000]   but that's my past year specific advice,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.860]   but one day aside for sermon writing.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.480]   All right, well, speaking of sermon writing,
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.760]   this has nothing to do with sermon writing,
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.160]   I'm talking about ads.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.240]   A sponsor I wanna mention real quick before we move on,
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   we're at the 38 minute point, so here we go.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.040]   I'm gonna do rapid fire questions after this.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.520]   The sponsor I wanna talk about is ExpressVPN.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:46.080]   I don't think people realize the degree
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.040]   to which what you are doing on the internet
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.640]   can be monitored.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   Verizon, for example, has even admitted
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.640]   that it collects data on where it is you're going,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.800]   what webpages you are accessing it.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.500]   They say that they are storing your data to,
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.440]   and I'm reading a quote here,
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.280]   "Better understand your interest."
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.680]   But really they're gonna sell that information
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.660]   to advertisers.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.240]   This type of nonsense and shenanigans
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.480]   happens all the time when you're connected to the internet.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.760]   This is why you need a VPN.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.080]   And if you're gonna use a VPN,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.820]   I recommend that you use the VPN
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.560]   that I personally use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.800]   So ExpressVPN is an app.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.720]   It's a VPN app.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.000]   And the way it works real briefly
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   is that instead of just directly connecting
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.060]   to the website you care about,
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.740]   you instead connect to a ExpressVPN server.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.440]   You form an encrypted channel to that server
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.120]   so you can send stuff to that server
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.360]   that Verizon, your phone carrier,
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.480]   the access point you're connected to,
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.200]   have no idea what you're doing.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.240]   You tell that server,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.800]   "Here's the website I wanna talk to."
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.040]   And then it talks to you on behalf of,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.080]   it talks to that website on behalf of you
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.420]   that encrypts what the website returns
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.080]   and sends that back to you securely.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.680]   So anyone watching your connection says,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.040]   "All I know is this guy is talking to ExpressVPN.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.880]   "Everything's encrypted.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.080]   "I have no idea what he or she is up to."
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.840]   ExpressVPN sets this up to run
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.240]   in the background of your devices.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.560]   So then once it's turned on,
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.420]   you just use your normal apps as you usually would.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.120]   I like ExpressVPN in particular
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.040]   because they have many servers all around the world
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.440]   with really fast speeds.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.840]   You don't even realize that you're going through a VPN,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.940]   but you get all of those advantages.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.880]   I found out recently, which is good,
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.560]   one subscription can support up to five devices.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.560]   So your one subscription can have your phone,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.000]   your iPad, your laptop,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.960]   all protected with the same subscription fee.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.560]   So when your phone carrier tracks you,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.480]   that's a gross invasion of privacy.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.720]   You can either keep letting them cash in on you,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.500]   or you can visit ExpressVPN.com/deep
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.120]   to get the same VPN I use.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.140]   Take back your online privacy today
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:01.760]   and use my link to get three extra months free.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-VPN.com/deep,
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.040]   ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   I also wanna talk about New Relic.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.240]   So I think all of my listeners who enjoyed
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.080]   the recent question I did about source code editors
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.040]   is going to know what I'm talking about here.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.380]   If you're a software engineer,
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.280]   you have had this happen to countless times
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   where you think you're done with work, you're at home,
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.000]   you've put on the Deep Questions podcast,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.860]   you're looking to relax and your phone buzzes,
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.720]   something in your system has broken.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.380]   Is it the server? Is it the network?
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.300]   Is it my front end? What is going on?
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.200]   Now everyone is scrambling to try to figure out
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.640]   what broke in your system
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   and figure out who it is that can fix it.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.800]   This is where if you use New Relic,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.760]   you can make your life a lot easier.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.380]   New Relic combined 16 different monitoring products
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.280]   that you'd normally buy separately.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.680]   This allows your engineering team
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.880]   to see across your entire software stack in one place.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.980]   It can then pinpoint issues down to the line of code
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.400]   causing the issue.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.080]   So you can get to the heart of the matter
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.720]   and fix it as quickly as possible.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.240]   That's why the dev and ops teams at DoorDash,
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.640]   GitHub, Epic Games, and more than 14,000 other companies
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.440]   already use New Relic to debug and improve their software.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.120]   This is the tool suite to use for this issue.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.940]   So whether you run a cloud native startup
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.960]   or a Fortune 500 company,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.680]   spend five minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.560]   So the next time that evening call is just that,
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.240]   I was, what I mean to say here is that next evening call
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.560]   is just waiting to happen.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.080]   You should get New Relic before it does.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.200]   You can get access to the whole New Relic platform
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.400]   and 100 gigabytes of data free and forever.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.560]   No credit card required.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.180]   If you sign up at newrelic.com/deep,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:03.200]   that's N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.com/deep,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.760]   newrelic.com/deep.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.840]   All right, Jesse, we are down to a couple minutes
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.680]   to my promised time, and I'm gonna do it.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:19.280]   And I'm gonna do it by being very fast with my questions.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   And to make that even more exciting,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.000]   somehow lost my questions.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.560]   Oh, here we go.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.400]   Behind the scenes, guys, I have so many papers.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.640]   We're very old fashioned.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.840]   My desk is just full of papers.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.000]   All right, rapid fire.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.160]   Got a question here from Kobe.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   Should I solely focus more on developing my skillset
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.920]   as a stock investor to the point
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   where my skillset cannot be ignored,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.400]   or should I build my skillset as a stock investor
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.720]   and at the same time continue to teach live courses
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.120]   on stock investing?
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.320]   It's getting to a point where I feel like
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.480]   I have to convince people to join my program
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.280]   and that's getting draining.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.240]   All right, Kobe, my general answer is focus on the stocks.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   All right, focus on the primary thing you're doing,
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.400]   which sounds like it's stock investing.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.920]   The course is a side hustle that do it at this point
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.120]   only if it was entertaining or relaxing.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   You're finding it draining.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.000]   Focus on the stocks.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.520]   Presumably, if you're good enough at the stocks
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.960]   to be able to teach a course on it,
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.440]   you should be making more than enough money
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.920]   from the stocks to not need the course financially.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.240]   If you need the course financially,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.720]   then you're not good enough at stocks to teach that course.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.760]   So I think we've got a great self-referential solution here.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.440]   My tough love specific answer, however, Kobe,
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.920]   is you're not gonna teach yourself to beat the stock market.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   Let me tell you this as someone who comes out
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.520]   of elite Ivy League schools where I've watched people
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.360]   go off to prop trading desk at Wall Street firms.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.560]   The very smartest people in the world
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.720]   are incredibly well compensated to do nothing
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.880]   but spend all day training and executing
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.200]   the best possible plans to make money on the stock market
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.240]   and even they can't consistently do it.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.480]   I had a friend in college, I remember talking to him
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.120]   about his job a few years out of college.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.800]   All he did was had CEOs, a small number of CEOs
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.080]   of publicly traded companies and his whole job
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.880]   was to listen to every public announcement
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.840]   or discussion or conversation they ever have
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.680]   and really learn the nuances of this individual person
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.240]   so they could pick up just subtle edges
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.280]   and what's going on with this person's company.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.680]   You're not gonna learn some momentum trading technique
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.880]   on the internet that's gonna have you
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.160]   consistently build the market.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.280]   You are probably the sucker there.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.480]   And so that's my tough love thing.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.640]   Invest in index funds, put your time and energy
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.280]   into other ways of making money.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.120]   All right, one more question.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.400]   Poseidon's Trident says, "You mentioned a lot of concepts
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.760]   "and influences from the military.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.300]   "Is there anything you agree with from the military,
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.200]   "modern military relating to lifestyle design
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.720]   "or disagree with?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.640]   "Who else do you look for?
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.820]   "What else has influenced you from the military world?"
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.600]   So I've jotted down here, Poseidon,
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.240]   four things I've seen in the military world
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.600]   that have had some influence on me.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.560]   So I'll just go through them real quick.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.660]   One, have a creed.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.060]   So military, especially elite military units
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.120]   are really big at, let's be clear,
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.640]   this is our code, this is our creed.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.520]   This is what we do and what we value,
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.620]   even if it is hard and they clarify it
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.720]   so they can work off of it.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.740]   I think Jocko was actually involved
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:29.000]   in crafting the Navy SEAL ethos in the 1990s.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.120]   I think it was Jocko, maybe it was Mark Devine.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.960]   But knowing what you're all about
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.720]   so that you can stick to that.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.000]   I think that's a critical idea,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.520]   especially when times get hard.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.560]   You can fall back on your creed and get value out of,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.600]   I stuck to my code and my creed.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.320]   Otherwise, you're bouncing all over the place
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   and just sort of taking each moment as it comes.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.080]   Two, serving others is everything.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.220]   This is the main lesson of anyone you talk to
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.920]   that fought in any war.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.460]   Go back and read about World War II
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.280]   for more modern conflicts,
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.240]   read Sebastian Younger's book, "Tribe."
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.400]   Talk to anyone who has been in active warfare.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.940]   They say, "It's all about the people around me."
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:12.320]   Risking my life, everything is around the people in my unit,
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.480]   the people in my unit and protecting them,
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.160]   trying to be there for them, trying to serve them.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.240]   It's incredibly powerful.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.460]   It goes deep into our wiring.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.740]   It's something I think we could all learn.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.200]   Serving others is everything.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.040]   Way more important than accolades,
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.700]   way more important than getting a lot of likes,
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.360]   way more important than your TikTok video,
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.080]   picking up or trying to impress people.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.960]   Serving others is what we're wired to do.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.920]   War makes that really clear.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.680]   Idea number three, embrace the suck.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.400]   This is a Navy SEAL idea.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.680]   Brent Gleason wrote a book with that title.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.700]   One of the core things they teach you in Navy SEAL training
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.880]   is to be very comfortable
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.920]   with being incredibly uncomfortable.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:54.240]   So I can be very uncomfortable and that's okay.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.620]   I can be sleep deprived, my skin's abraded,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.220]   I'm exhausted, my muscles are barking,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.300]   I maybe have a stress fracture,
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.140]   I'm not telling anyone about it
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.100]   and I'm still gonna execute.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.580]   I can still compartmentalize and execute.
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.460]   Obviously that's critical
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.300]   if you're gonna be a special operations operator,
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.340]   but I think it's important for life in general
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.300]   because hard stuff happens.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.820]   And you kind of have two choices.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.660]   Either you are going to obsess about it and fall apart
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.940]   or say, "Okay, this is hard, I feel bad, what's next?"
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.840]   Hoo-yah or whatever it is that the SEALs say.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.920]   I don't know if you heard about this, Jesse,
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.080]   earlier this year, it was terrible
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.680]   at BUD/S training in Navy SEALs.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.600]   One of the things they do
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.680]   that make you really uncomfortable during Hell Week
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.920]   is you, they call it getting wet and sandy.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.320]   You go into the ocean and they make you roll in sand
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.040]   until every inch of your body is covered in sand.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.000]   And then you have to go and do a lot of exercises
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.820]   and terrible stuff.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.400]   So you're just completely uncomfortable.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.320]   And so your skin is all just ripped up and abraded.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.300]   Well, there was a unplanned release of sewage
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.540]   or some contaminant got into the water off a Coronado.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.900]   And the whole SEAL team was hospitalized.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.420]   They all got terrible staph infections from the water.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.520]   And one of them even died.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.340]   It was terrible, that happened this year.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.420]   Because the reason why their whole bodies
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.580]   was abraded and bloody
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.920]   was because that's the core of the training.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:16.620]   Little known fact is I have Jesse do that once a week
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.720]   just to try to make sure that he's completely sharp
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   for doing the show.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   I say, come on, Jesse, get wet and sandy.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.560]   Oh man.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.380]   Okay, and the last thing,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.720]   and you've heard me say this before probably,
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.780]   is discipline is freedom.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.320]   This pops up in a lot of places.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.600]   That's Jocko's phrase,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.080]   but Admiral McRaven has "Make Your Bed,"
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.020]   his best-selling book.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.720]   You see this a lot in military context,
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.680]   which is discipline in the moment seems
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.580]   like you're placing arbitrary restrictions
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.880]   and wouldn't your life be happier
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.200]   if people just left you alone?
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.520]   But discipline is the foundation for freedom.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.280]   It's how you teach yourself that you have efficacy,
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.680]   that you have control over your life.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.000]   It's what allows you to uncover and pursue options
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.200]   that are important and stick away
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.160]   from the things that are going to hurt you.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.200]   The discipline life is often a life
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.540]   where you feel more confident,
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.640]   you feel better about yourself,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.080]   you feel more resilient.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.280]   Obviously, you don't wanna push it to an extreme.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.920]   If you're David Goggins,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.040]   it gets a little bit out of control.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.560]   But discipline should not be demonized.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.000]   And I think the military is great at that.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.320]   You're gonna do arbitrary things in a disciplined fashion
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.080]   because when it comes to the non-arbitrary things,
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.880]   you need that foundation.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.520]   And there's a reason why they do that,
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.680]   why they shine their boots and make their beds.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.300]   It matters.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.840]   All right, Jesse, I have five minutes late,
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.960]   but that's pretty good for me, right?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.440]   50 minutes?
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.560]   - Great. - Pretty tight.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.400]   - Good stuff.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.200]   - All right, so we gotta wrap this up.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.960]   Thank you, everyone, who sent in your questions.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.240]   We'll have a classic episode on Thursday,
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.840]   but then God willing, I will be back as normal
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.160]   the week after.
