[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.440]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in the second chapter and the twelfth verse.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.520]   The twelfth verse in the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.560]   And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, "What meaneth this?"
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.560]   And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, "What meaneth this?"
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.280]   It seems to me that the best way in which we can consider that great and notable event
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.320]   which happened on that day of Pentecost at Jerusalem so long ago, the account of which
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.820]   is to be found in this second chapter of this Book of the Acts of the Apostles, is to look
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.440]   at it in the light of that question which was put by a number of people who happened
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.000]   to be up at the great religious festival that was being observed and celebrated at that
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.200]   time in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.960]   Now here, I say, is the question that focuses attention on the entire incident and which
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.800]   will help us, therefore, to come to an understanding as to why it is that this Sunday, Whits Sunday
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:40.240]   as we call it, is traditionally observed in the Church as the anniversary of the day on
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   which this notable and remarkable event took place.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.760]   So often we use these terms, talk about Christmas, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Whitsunday, and
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   so on, without quite realizing why we do so, and obviously that is not right.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   What is this day?
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   What does it mean?
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   What does it represent?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   What does it tell us?
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.520]   Well, I say, the best way to look at that is to ask this very question.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.280]   What meaneth this?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.400]   What is this thing that happened there on that first Whitsunday, if you may so like
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.560]   to term it?
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.960]   Well now, Peter, the Apostle Peter, you remember, got up and he addressed the crowd.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.320]   And what he really did was to answer that very question.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.300]   There were some mockers, we are told, who standing by said, "These men are full of
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   new wine."
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.080]   They said, "These men are drunk.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.160]   This is just sheer drunkenness."
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.800]   Because these apostles and others upon whom the Holy Spirit had come were undoubtedly
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.960]   in a state of ecstasy.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.680]   They were filled with joy, and they were speaking in these various languages, so that all these
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.320]   people gathered together were able to hear them speaking in their own tongues, in their
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.480]   own languages.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.880]   The more serious people put the question, "What meaneth this?"
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.840]   The others, the superficial, said, "Oh, they're just drunk."
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   And the Apostle, you remember, deals with the situation.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.160]   He can easily prove that it wasn't a question of drunkenness; the very hour of the day in
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.680]   and of itself made that quite impossible.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.320]   But he doesn't stop at that, of course, and goes on to give them a positive exposition.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.200]   Very well, what does it all lead to?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.840]   The first thing we have to say is this, that we are considering together something which
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   has happened in history.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.280]   This is an historical event.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:10.160]   We are not simply calling attention to some story or to some figment of the imagination
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.880]   or merely some tradition which may have or may not have a very tenuous connection with
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.440]   the historical facts and events.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.320]   The first thing that we must be quite clear about is that this is something which belongs
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   to history.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.920]   Now, that doesn't, of course, only apply to this fact.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.960]   All the facts in the New Testament belong to history.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.920]   Christianity, as we must constantly continue to point out, Christianity is not a philosophy.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   It's not just a view of life.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.040]   It's not just a kind of concept.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.400]   Christianity is primarily the record of a series of events and of facts which have taken
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800]   place in this world.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.360]   Now, this event belongs to that series, as I am going to show you, and it belongs to
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.600]   that category.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.840]   What is recorded here in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles is
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   sheer history.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   It's a definite bit of history, as is the fact that Julius Caesar conquered this country
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.600]   in B.C. 55 or 54, whichever it was.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.040]   Now it belongs to the same order.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.320]   It's something that happened in history after that date on which Julius Caesar conquered
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.120]   this country.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.840]   And I'm stressing this and emphasizing this for this good reason, that if this had not
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.680]   literally and actually taken place, if this wasn't real and true history, well, we wouldn't
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.320]   be here in this building at this moment, for there wouldn't be a Christian church.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.720]   This is, in a sense, the inauguration of the Christian church.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.980]   The Christian church which has come down to us through the running centuries began, really,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.560]   at this point.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   It is here that the church as we know her really began to function.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.500]   So you see what an important fact this really is.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.980]   And we must hold on to it, I say, as a literal fact.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.000]   Now I haven't time to stay with this this evening, but it would be a very simple thing
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.040]   for me to prove this contention of mine, that there would never have been a Christian church
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.260]   were it not for this.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.680]   You remember what these apostles and disciples were like after our Lord's crucifixion?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.640]   And how after his resurrection he appeared unto them and spoke to them and taught them,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.880]   but still they were in no condition to start the Christian church and to do what they actually
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.640]   did do.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   Now this is the thing that alone explains that.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.600]   This tremendous thing happened.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.960]   Here were these apostles and the hundred and twenty in an upper room, and suddenly there
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:22.200]   came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.680]   were sitting.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:41.200]   and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.400]   Spirit gave them utterance.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.160]   Now that, I say, is a sheer bit of history.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.240]   And if it didn't happen, there would never have been a Christian church.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.640]   Oh, I know that there are people who dispute this, as they dispute the resurrection, as
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.960]   they dispute the incarnation, and as they dispute everything else.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.460]   But you see, there's nothing modern in doing that.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.720]   There were people in Jerusalem nearly 2,000 years ago who said, "These men are drunk."
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.120]   So it's not the hallmark of modernity to fail to recognize truth and facts.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.520]   No, no, this thing happened.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.640]   What we are considering here is not some misunderstanding of what happened, alas, I'm ashamed to say
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   it.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:35.020]   I read even in a church newspaper this week a statement to this effect, that what happened
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.340]   here was that the atmosphere was very heavy and oppressive.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:44.180]   The sun can be very powerful in Palestine, and there everything was oppressive and everybody
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.820]   felt sad and dejected, as we all tend to do in such weather.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:56.800]   But suddenly there came a delightful breeze, and the atmosphere lifted, and the sun began
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.220]   to shine more brightly and to cast shadows.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.200]   Can you explain the Christian church and her story on such a theory?
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.120]   Is that likely to have led to this extraordinary scene that was enacted in Jerusalem?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.400]   Would that have produced a crowd?
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.160]   Maybe the fact that a number of people had felt heavy and lethargic and weary and sleepy
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:28.200]   and tired suddenly began to feel a little bit fresh.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.480]   It's not surprising that the Christian church is as she is when you get that in church organs.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.160]   My friends, this is a fact.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   This thing happened and first amazed and astounded the people in the upper room, and then proceeded
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.360]   to astound everybody else and to shake the city of Jerusalem.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.240]   This, I say, is history.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.280]   That's the first thing we've got to lay hold on.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.720]   But it isn't merely that, there's another thing.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.040]   This thing that happened, as the apostle Peter proceeds to point out, is a fulfillment of
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   prophecy.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.080]   Peter standing up with the others, lifted up his voice and said unto them, "You men
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:24.440]   of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.880]   For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day."
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.200]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.880]   Use your senses, pull yourselves together.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.640]   How can it possibly be drunkenness?
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.560]   The very hour of the day precludes the possibility.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   It isn't that.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   Well, what is it?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   "This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel."
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.120]   And he proceeds, you remember, to quote a passage from the second chapter of the book
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   of the prophet Joel.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.760]   Well, now then, I take up this principle.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.120]   This thing which happened there on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem is a fulfillment
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   of prophecy.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.080]   It's not only prophesied by Joel, you'll find it prophesied by Isaiah, you'll find
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.120]   it prophesied in Ezekiel, indeed you'll find it prophesied a way back in the book
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.480]   of Leviticus.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:33.520]   You will find there that God gave Moses instruction with regard to the observance of certain feasts.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.960]   And amongst these feasts that they were to observe was the feast which was called the
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   Feast of Pentecost.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   And it was because the Feast of Pentecost was being held at that time that all these
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.080]   different people had come up, the Parthians and the Medes and the Elamites and the dwellers
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.880]   in Mesopotamia and people from Rome, Jews from all over the world, gravitated to Jerusalem
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:02.000]   on the day of Pentecost and the Feast of Pentecost because they had been commended to do so.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.640]   It was one of the great feasts of the ancient nation of Israel.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.080]   And what I am indicating is that that actual Feast of Pentecost was one of the ways in
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:23.060]   which God had foretold and had prophesied this very thing that happened in Jerusalem
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.720]   on this notable day of Pentecost.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.780]   So you see, it's important that we should bear that in mind for this reason.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.800]   This is not just an odd event.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.160]   This is not just something that happened.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.920]   This is not just something that happened accidentally.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Well what is it?
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:51.000]   Well, it's a part of God's great plan of redemption, which he himself had foretold
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.120]   right through the Old Testament in differing ways, as I have just been indicating to you.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   Indeed, this thing that happened there on the day of Pentecost is the last of a great
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:14.840]   series of events and actions, historical events and actions, by means of which God was providing
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.160]   a way to save mankind.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.840]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:30.000]   It is the last of the great series of acts in connection especially with our Lord and
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.560]   Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:40.520]   Now that is the whole secret of understanding what happened at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.000]   You are familiar with the great events, aren't you?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.360]   The New Testament is rarely a record of them, I mean the Gospels and this book of Acts.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:56.280]   Now that every one of them had been foretold, man had fallen into sin and God had pronounced
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.880]   judgment, but he had also promised deliverance.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.820]   And then he began to give them indications as to how the deliverance was going to come.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.600]   As I'm never tired of repeating, it's all in a nutshell in Genesis 3.15, "The seed
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.420]   of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.680]   There it is.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.140]   Then God proceeds to unfold it a bit here and a bit there.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.880]   You can trace it right through the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:33.440]   But they're all just pointing forward to this series of climactic crucial events, which
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.740]   are recorded here in the Gospels and in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.400]   What are they?
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.560]   Well the first of them of course is the coming of John the Baptist.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.120]   It had been foretold that when the Messiah was about to come there would be a forerunner.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:15:00.240]   "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God, a voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.280]   prepare ye the way of the Lord."
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   That's Isaiah 40, isn't it?
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.400]   You see the juxtaposition of the two things.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   How are we to know when the comfort is coming?
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   How are we to know when salvation is about to dawn?
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:20.920]   Ah, the forerunner, the voice in the wilderness, John the Baptist, will come first.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   There's the first big event, therefore, after 400 years of silence, for there was no prophet
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.160]   after Malachi for 400 long years.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.300]   And the nation was waiting, and no word came from God.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:43.360]   But suddenly this man arises, "The word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   wilderness."
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   Something's happening.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.160]   God has raised up a man.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.680]   There's the first event.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.720]   And then the series follows.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.200]   And I'm not going to stay with them this evening, but it's important we should see exactly what
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.680]   happened at Pentecost.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:10.940]   The first mighty event was Bethlehem, the birth of a babe in a stable to a virgin called
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:17.680]   Mary, Jesus, the babe that was laid in the manger.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.800]   That's a fact.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.120]   That's an event.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   That's the mightiest event in history.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.960]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.880]   God has entered into time.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.200]   God has taken unto himself human nature in his son.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   What an event!
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   Staggering!
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   There it is.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.760]   There's the first of this particular series.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.280]   And then go on, but let me hurry to the crucial ones.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:52.800]   Calvary, the death on the cross, how he was taken, condemned, nailed in helplessness to
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   the tree.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.400]   Calvary, the death of this Jesus.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.320]   What an event!
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:05.480]   There he is, the creator of the universe, dying and expiring.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.560]   And he dies.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.120]   These are events.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:16.240]   And then the mighty event and fact of the resurrection, how he burst us under the bends
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.000]   of death and rose triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   It happened, my friend.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.920]   He literally came out of the grave.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   The grave was empty.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.200]   They found the clothes, but not the person.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.280]   He had risen.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   The body had disappeared.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   What an event!
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   What a shattering event!
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:40.960]   The rising again of the Son of God, who had died in the flesh, the resurrection.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.160]   What an event!
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:53.640]   And then his ascension from that mountaintop in the sight of his chosen disciples.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.980]   He was taken up into heaven and disappeared.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.980]   These are the events.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:05.560]   And then this event, here is the last of the mighty events, here is the last of this great
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:13.120]   and extraordinary series, the sending of the Holy Ghost, the coming down of the third person
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:21.160]   in the Trinity, God, the Holy Spirit, being poured out upon the infant church.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.320]   Now there, I say, is the way to approach this, this event in history, this great fact.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:34.880]   It is the last of a series of actions which God has taken in connection with our salvation.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   And every one of them had been prophesied.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.860]   And if you take the trouble to go back into your books of Exodus and of Leviticus, this
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.920]   is what you will find, that it was there prophesied that the feast of Pentecost was to be fifty
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.880]   days after the crucifixion and resurrection.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.800]   Only that length of time.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.400]   And if you would like to come to your New Testament and then work it out, you will find
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:09.680]   that it is the exact difference in time, in days, between the death and resurrection and
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.760]   the coming down of the Holy Ghost.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.360]   Why have I taken the trouble to remind you of these facts?
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.920]   My answer, my dear friend, is just this.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.040]   This is one of those mighty proofs of the fact that this book which I have in front
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.680]   of me is the Word of God.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.240]   That this is no ordinary book, that this is not the book of men, that this is not merely
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.160]   a record of what men have thought of God or their attempt to interpret their experiences
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   of God.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   No, no.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   This is God's book.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.320]   This is God revealing himself.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.240]   And so, centuries before the events happened, God said they are going to happen.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:03.320]   And therefore, Pentecost is one of the great and mighty proofs of the fact that the Bible
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:11.120]   is the Word of God, and that you and I therefore should listen to it, that we should pay heed
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.080]   to its message, that we should realize that this is no ordinary word, but that it is God
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.600]   speaking to us.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.500]   Have you listened to it?
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.560]   Do you know its message?
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   Are you aware of what it has to say?
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   The day of Pentecost, as a fulfillment of prophecy, is, I say, a substantiating of the
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:42.320]   fact that the Bible is indeed God's Word to man, to which we must listen for our very
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   soul's sake.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.560]   That is the first thing, but let me come to a second thing.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:54.800]   What happened on the day of Pentecost is not only a proof of the fact that the Old Testament
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:05.080]   is the Word of God, it is equally a proof of the claims that the Lord Jesus Christ made
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.320]   for himself and his person.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.280]   Now, this is of tremendous significance.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.680]   This day of Pentecost proved again in a final manner that Jesus of Nazareth was what he
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:28.080]   claimed to be, the only begotten Son of God.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.300]   That is the heart of the gospel, isn't it?
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.760]   What is this gospel?
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.200]   Is it my views on war or peace or bombs?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Not at all.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.560]   It is primarily this, that God hath visited and redeemed his people, that something has
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.720]   happened which had never happened before, that God the Son has come out of heaven and
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:52.400]   has entered into time and has lived in this world, that Jesus is Son of God.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   That is the gospel.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.600]   Now, I say this day of Pentecost is one of the final proofs of that.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.840]   How does it prove it?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.760]   Well, it proves it in this way.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:11.440]   You go back and read those Old Testament prophecies about the coming of the Holy Spirit, and you
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:19.340]   will find that they always tell us that the Holy Spirit was going to be sent by the Messiah,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:25.600]   by the Great One who was going to come to deliver the people.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.320]   Always the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit is associated, I say, with the coming
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:42.000]   of the Messiah, and therefore the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.440]   is the proof that he is the Messiah.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.600]   But wait, I can add to that.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.440]   If you go through your gospels and read what our Lord himself said, you will find that
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.800]   he said this kind of thing.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.160]   He tells his disciples who are crestfallen and unhappy when he announces his departure
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:10.200]   and his death, he tells them not to be downcast, that he is going to send them another comforter.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:18.920]   He tells them in John chapters 14, 15, and 16, that he is going to send this third person
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.200]   in the blessed Holy Trinity to them.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:27.440]   He makes it perfectly plain, "If I go away, I will send him unto you."
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.520]   He committed himself.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.720]   He stated it quite explicitly.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.480]   He says, "I am the Son of God, and I'm going back to the Father.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.880]   He'll give me the gift, and I will send the gift upon you."
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.600]   Now he staked his whole reputation upon it.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.640]   Indeed, you remember that after the resurrection he did the same thing again.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.120]   You'll find it in the first chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.680]   We read in verse 4, "And being assembled together with them, he commended them that they should
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.960]   not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, Ye
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:12.080]   have heard of me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.920]   the Holy Ghost, not many days hence."
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.800]   Then he said this again.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.640]   He said, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:34.520]   his own power, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.640]   And you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.480]   unto the outermost parts of the earth."
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.600]   Now you see the thing is absolutely explicit.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.760]   He said, "Stay where you are.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   I am in a few days time going to send the Holy Spirit upon you."
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.160]   So he goes on repeating it.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.760]   What he is really saying is this, "I am going to prove to you that I am the Messiah and
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.640]   the Son of God, and I'm going to prove it in that way."
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.680]   God has been promising throughout the centuries a great gift to mankind, the gift of his Spirit.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.640]   He says he's going to give it through the Messiah.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.080]   I am telling you that I am going to send the gift.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.320]   He had said this also to them.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.360]   He said, "When he, the Holy Spirit, is come, he shall reprove the world of sin and of righteousness
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.120]   and of judgment, of sin because they believe not on me."
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.320]   He says, "There I'll prove to them that they're wrong because I'm going to send the Spirit
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:46.000]   and that proves that I am the Son of God."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.880]   So you see the crucial importance of this event that happened on the Day of Pentecost?
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.920]   It is the final proof of the fact that he is what he claimed to be, the only begotten
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:06.640]   Son of God who had entered into this world and time in order to rescue and to redeem
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.480]   the world.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:18.040]   If he hadn't sent the Holy Spirit, his claims would have fallen to the ground, though he
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.160]   had actually risen from the dead.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.720]   But here his claim is proved, his promise is vindicated.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.080]   He is the one he says he is.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:36.360]   He is God the Son and he has given the gift of the Spirit having received it himself from
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   the Father.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:45.880]   "He that ascended is the same also that descended," says Paul, "into the lowest parts of the earth.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.840]   He has ascended upon high.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.040]   He has given gifts unto men."
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:27:00.760]   It is a positive proof that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:12.140]   But thirdly and lastly, it is this, it is the first clear, definite, and explicit exposition
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:20.120]   of the way of salvation.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:29.820]   The Holy Spirit was sent in order that he might mediate and apply to mankind the salvation
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:38.560]   that had now become possible through the work of the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   Christ.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:46.440]   And so what you have got in this chapter is an account of how he began to do that.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.680]   This is the business of the Church.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.920]   The Holy Spirit uses the Church in order to save, and he began doing it there on the day
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:02.200]   of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.440]   What is this way of salvation?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.400]   How does he do it?
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.200]   How is it brought to pass?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:21.240]   How can a world that is steeped in sin and shame and ignorance and unbelief, how can
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.040]   it be brought to a knowledge of God?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.720]   How can it be forgiven?
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.920]   How can it be delivered from its sin and the thralldom and the tyranny of sin?
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   How can it happen?
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   Well, the answer is given here.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:43.280]   The Holy Spirit began to do it even through the preaching of a man like this, Apostle
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.400]   Peter.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   And what do we find?
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.540]   Well, what we find is this.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:57.680]   We first of all are brought face to face with his mighty power.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.920]   The Apostle Peter was addressing a company of people who but a few weeks before, when
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.760]   Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, had asked them whether he should release unto them Jesus
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:20.160]   of Nazareth, or somebody else persisted in crying out and saying, "Not Jesus, but Barabbas!"
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:28.000]   He was addressing people who had been shouting and saying, "Away with him, crucify him!"
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.760]   And you notice that as he spoke to them, something began to happen to them.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   What was it?
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   Well, it was this work of the Holy Spirit, this power of the Spirit that was dealing
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   with them.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   Peter couldn't.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.160]   Peter was a very ordinary man and a very nervous, frightened man, but here he is speaking with
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.880]   authority and power.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.320]   Apostle Peter, who but a few weeks before had denied his Lord in order to save his life
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:59.240]   and his skin, stands up before the hostile mob and defies their very authorities and
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:04.620]   powers and proclaims the name of this Jesus whom formerly he had denied.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.620]   What is this?
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:12.560]   This is the power of the Holy Spirit in him.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:19.080]   And this is the influence of the Spirit ever since in the church.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.640]   No man has ever become a Christian without the influence and the power of this Holy Spirit
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.080]   of God upon him.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:33.600]   Yes, says Oliver Goldsmith, "Fools who came to scoff remain to pray."
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   What had happened to them?
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.240]   The Holy Spirit had laid hold upon them.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   The Spirit that took hold of these people listening to Peter is the Spirit that has
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:46.320]   taken hold of men throughout the running centuries, and that is what makes the work of the church
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   a miracle.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:57.160]   It was the same Spirit that dealt with the men like Saul of Tarsus.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.880]   It's the same Spirit that has dealt with all men who once have been haters of Christ and
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   his gospel and haters of the church and has turned them into saints.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.720]   It's this power of the Spirit, the power of God, the Holy Spirit, the power that can
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.060]   create anew.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:21.120]   He descends and he works, and what is his work?
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   Well you notice that his primary work is a work of convicting of sin.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.600]   You see, Peter stood up and he spoke about Jesus Christ.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.920]   He said, "You took him in with cruel hands.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.720]   You have killed him and murdered him.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.040]   But he has risen again from the dead."
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.760]   And as Peter went on speaking, he finally brought it to a climax in these words.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:51.400]   He said, "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:58.160]   same Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:05.560]   And then I read this, "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:12.480]   said unto Peter and unto the rest of the apostles, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'"
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.440]   They're desperate, they're crying out for help, what's happened to them.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:24.800]   Oh, I say, the explanation is that they have become convicted of sin.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:33.000]   Peter, you see, has quoted the prophet Joel, and Joel says, "When these great days come,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.240]   amongst other things, this will happen, and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.040]   call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.320]   And these men are beginning to call on the name of the Lord.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.520]   Why have they done so?
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   What's the matter?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.600]   Well, the answer is that they are convicted of sin.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.880]   These people who are so self-satisfied at the beginning of the sermon, they begin to
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.520]   say, "What shall we do?
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   What's happened to them?"
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:11.440]   I say, they've come under conviction, conviction of sin.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.080]   What does that mean, says someone?
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.620]   Well, let me try and tell you very briefly what it means.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:24.240]   They began to feel that they were guilty before God.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.080]   They crucified that Jesus.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.860]   They hadn't recognized him.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.800]   They thought he was but a carpenter and an imposter.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.280]   But now they can see that he has risen from the dead, and he sent forth this.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.680]   And these men are speaking in strange languages.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   They can't explain it.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.240]   There's only one explanation.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.200]   This Jesus, whom they've cried against, he's son of God.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.440]   What fools they were!
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.180]   How blind they must have been.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:53.600]   They're conscious of their sin.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:06.940]   They were confronted, you see, by a manifestation of the power of God.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.640]   And in the presence of this manifestation of the power of God, they began to feel and
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.400]   to know their own sinfulness.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.880]   God!
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.360]   They'd not live to his glory.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.920]   They'd gone their own way.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.440]   So blind were they that they didn't recognize his son.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.400]   They'd failed to keep his commandments.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.380]   They hadn't understood his scriptures.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:34.680]   They hadn't seen the meaning of the prophets and all their glorious prophecies.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.760]   They've been living as if there wasn't a God, and as if God had never done anything at all,
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.900]   that this great series had never taken place.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.560]   And they begin to realize what a terrible thing it is.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:54.440]   They've lived to please themselves, not to please God.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.000]   They are sinners in the sight of God.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.680]   And they begin to see that they are such, because there is within them a sinful nature,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:12.760]   that they're so blinded by this twisted, perverted nature produced by sin, that they couldn't
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.280]   recognize the Son of God when he stood before them.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.720]   And when they even saw him dying and expiring on the cross, it meant nothing.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.320]   They wagged their heads and mocked at him, and jeered at him, and spat in his face and
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.720]   said, "If thou be the Son of God, save thyself, come down from the cross."
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.320]   And now it all comes back to them, the blindness and the horror of it all.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.840]   "What shall we do?" they say.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.400]   What had happened to them?
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:47.580]   Oh, that's the Holy Spirit convincing them and convicting them of sin, as the Lord Jesus
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:54.120]   Christ himself had prophesied that he would do.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.440]   But this, you see, is the way of salvation.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:03.560]   "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.120]   What makes a man call on the name of the Lord?
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.280]   Well, it is that he sees he is hopeless.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:18.080]   No man calls on the name of the Lord until he realizes that he is a sinner.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.520]   Have you called on the name of the Lord?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.440]   Have you ever realized you're a desperate plight?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.400]   Have you ever had a second's worry about yourself and your own soul?
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.560]   Is all well with you?
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:44.840]   Are you ready to die and to meet God in the judgment?
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.480]   Have you lived to the glory of God all the days of your life?
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.440]   You were created in order to do that.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.200]   God made man for himself.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:01.080]   The chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.920]   The first and the greatest commandment says the Son of God is, "Thou shalt love the Lord
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.320]   thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength."
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.220]   Have you done it?
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.040]   He'll ask you in the day of judgment.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.560]   He made you for that.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   Do you know God?
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.160]   Are you enjoying the life of God?
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.960]   Are you living to the glory of God?
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:31.280]   If not, you're a sinner, a vile sinner, and you're under the judgment of God, and you'll
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.700]   go to hell if you die in that state.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.880]   Had you realized that?
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.560]   It's people who realize that who cry out unto the Lord.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:52.240]   They realize further that they are like that because of this devastating thing that the
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:59.280]   fall of men has done, that their natures are vile and rotten and twisted and perverted,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.300]   that we are creatures of lusts and desires and passions, and that we hate God.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.440]   And here we are, and what can we do?
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.120]   We suddenly realize it, and we'll say, "We'll try to get better," but we can't.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.200]   We are desperate.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.040]   We are convicted of sin.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.920]   You see, sin is not primarily a matter of actions.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.280]   It's a matter of our relationship to God.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.440]   You can be a highly respectable person, and yet the greatest sinner in the world, for
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.360]   a sinner is a man who doesn't live entirely to the glory of God.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.440]   That's what a sinner is.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.040]   Very well then, that's the first thing, conviction of sin, but then you see this next thing comes
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.240]   in, "Whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord."
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   What does that mean?
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:49.160]   Well, this is just an explicit way of stating the way of salvation.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:56.480]   The man who becomes a Christian, the man who is saved, is the man who, having realized
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:04.360]   that he thus is a sinner in the sight of God, realizes further that he can do nothing at
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.120]   all about saving himself.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.720]   His first impulse is, of course, to pull himself together, to start reading the Bible, praying,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.480]   doing good, leaving sin, taking up something else.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.160]   He's going to make himself a Christian.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.280]   He's going to reconcile himself with God.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:25.080]   Well, of course, if he does that, he doesn't call on the name of the Lord, does he?
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.000]   He's calling on himself.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.040]   But that isn't the man who is saved, "Whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   What's it mean?
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   Oh, it means this.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.640]   You see, it's the answer Peter gave to the people who asked him the question, "Men and
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.960]   brethren, what shall we do?
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.880]   What shall we do?
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.480]   Shall I enter into a convent?
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.720]   Shall I become a monk?
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   Shall I become a hermit or an anchorite?
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.160]   Shall I give the whole of my life to fasting and sweating and praying?
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   No, no.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   It will never save you.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.720]   Call on the name of the Lord."
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:03.120]   What's that?
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:11.720]   "Repent, repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus for remission
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.000]   of sins."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.960]   That's calling on the name of the Lord.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   What's it mean?
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.760]   It means this, that you realize that you are a sinner of such a dye in the presence of
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:29.800]   God that you can do literally nothing about yourself at all.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.920]   You're not only lost, but you're helpless.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.200]   You are utterly hopeless.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.240]   What can you do?
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.560]   There is only one way of salvation, says Peter, and Joel had prophesied it.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:51.060]   There as you are in the dregs and in the failure, all you can do is to cry out, to call on the
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.680]   name of the Lord.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   What does that mean?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:03.400]   "Well, it means," says Peter, "that you acknowledge and confess your sin to God."
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   That's repentance, that you stop trying to excuse yourself.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.640]   You stop trying to explain your life away.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.160]   You stop trying to put yourself right.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.880]   You say, "No, I have sinned.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   I'm a desperate sinner.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   I'm hopeless."
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   Repent.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   Confess it.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   Acknowledge it.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   And what then?
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.320]   "Well, call on the name of the Lord.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   Believe the message that Jesus of Nazareth is none other than the only begotten Son of
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:38.440]   God, and that he came into this world in order to save you."
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.640]   That that's the whole explanation of all the great series of events, that the problem of
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.560]   sin was as great as this.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:52.040]   I say it with reverence that even the Almighty God in heaven couldn't save us and deliver
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:57.120]   us by mere, mere word.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:04.800]   There was only one way whereby men could be saved, and that was the way that God devised
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   and adopted.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:12.160]   He sent his only begotten Son into the world.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.840]   He had to come to take on him human nature, to align himself with us, to take our sins
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.800]   upon him, to be our new representative.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.280]   We'd fallen in Adam.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.600]   We need a new man to start a new humanity to save us, and the Son of God came down.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.360]   He's the second Adam.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.520]   He's the last man.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:45.160]   "Call upon him" means that you believe that, that the Jesus who was put in the manger in
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.880]   Bethlehem, the Jesus who was a carpenter, the Jesus who began to preach at the age of
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:57.520]   thirty, the Jesus who died in weakness upon the cross and was buried and rose again, is
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:03.680]   the everlasting and eternal Son of God, co-equal, co-eternal with the Father, substance of the
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.440]   very eternal substance.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:12.560]   You believe that Jesus, that man, that carpenter, is the eternal Son of God.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.760]   But that alone won't save you.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:25.040]   You believe that he came into the world and did all that and endured that death upon the
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:34.520]   cross in order to save you, in order to take your sins and your guilt and your punishment
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:42.720]   upon himself, that God hath made him to be sin for you who knew no sin, that you might
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.700]   be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.360]   You believe that he's Son of God and that he came to taste death for you and to bear
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:55.840]   the punishment, that the stripes that you deserved were delivered and put upon him.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   You look at him.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   You say, "He's died for me.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.560]   I'll call out unto him, 'Christ, receive me.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.780]   Take me into the scope of your mighty salvation.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.780]   I'm lost.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   I'm helpless.'
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:15.900]   Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bid'st
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.860]   me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come."
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.800]   You call out unto him, "Repent," says Peter, "and be baptized every one of you in the name
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:38.340]   of the Lord Jesus and to the remission of sins."
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.340]   "And do that," he says, "and you shall be saved."
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:48.860]   Joel was perfectly right, "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord," that's all you
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   do.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:55.700]   Your righteousness is as filthy rags, your religiosity doesn't count at all, all the
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.160]   good you've ever done and all your marvelous idealism.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.860]   You may sacrifice a great career, give all your money away and go and build a hospital,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.620]   if you like, in the heart of Africa.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.260]   That doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:19.740]   There's only one way of being saved, and that is in utter helplessness and hopelessness,
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:28.380]   to look unto him and to say, "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy Lord's demands.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:37.140]   Could my zeal, no, respite, no, could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:47.860]   Thou must save, and thou alone, rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:55.220]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed, be of sin the double cure.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.340]   Cleanse me from its guilt and power."
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.000]   That's it.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.980]   You cry out unto him, "And if you do that, you shall be saved."
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   What does that mean?
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:14.820]   Well, it means this, that you will know that all your sins are forgiven, that Christ really
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:21.780]   has borne the punishment, that God has forgiven you, that God has reconciled you unto himself
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:27.140]   in and through Christ, that you needn't fear death, you needn't fear the grave, you needn't
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:33.420]   fear the judgment, the Christ who's gone through it all is covering you, his righteousness
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.900]   is upon you, you are engrafted into him, you belong to him, you've become a child of God
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:47.300]   and an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ, you'll be saved and you can know it, and you'll
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.600]   begin to rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.660]   You see, these people cried out to Peter and the rest saying, "Men and brethren, what shall
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.660]   we do?"
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:02.180]   And Peter replied saying, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:10.140]   unto the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost as we have, for the promise
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:15.060]   is unto you and unto your children and to as many as are far off and to as many as the
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.680]   Lord our God shall call."
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:30.580]   You do that, says Peter, and you shall become as we are, you'll have this amazing joy that
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.220]   is now thrilling the whole of our being.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:39.060]   We are new men and you can become new men and women, you'll have a new life and a new
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:47.800]   start and a new hope, you'll become the very children of God, and all you do in order to
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:48:00.180]   become that and to receive such riches is to call upon the name of the Lord.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.800]   Is this possible, says someone, is this possible for me?
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.380]   I've lived a godless life, I've never thought about God, Christ meant nothing to me but
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.380]   an oath.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.540]   Do you mean to tell me I've come into this service tonight that this is possible to me?
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.740]   My dear friend, I have every authority for saying so.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:29.220]   The prophecy is this, "Whosoever," and it's as wide as the universe, "whosoever shall
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.900]   call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.700]   It doesn't matter what nation you belong to, it doesn't matter what the color of your skin
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:44.620]   is, it doesn't matter what your antecedents are, it doesn't matter what your family was
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.660]   like, whether great or small, important or unimportant, it doesn't matter whether you're
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.820]   young or old, didn't you notice it?
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.300]   He says here, "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions,
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.380]   your old men shall dream dreams."
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.540]   You know, there are some people today who seem to think the gospel is only for young
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   people.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:10.180]   Thank God, it has the same promise for the old.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.320]   I don't care how old you are nor how young you are, that's why I never have special
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.300]   services for young people, it's a denial of the gospel in a sense.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.700]   It's for anybody, whosoever.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.300]   And the middle-aged and the aged need it as much as the young, perhaps more so because
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.380]   they're nearer the end, but it doesn't matter how old you are, you may have lived eighty
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:38.660]   years in sin and a slave of the devil, I'm addressing you, come, call out to him.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:48.280]   Young here and now, young or old, good or bad, moral or immoral, religious or irreligious,
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:50:00.780]   I care not, whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.520]   Why am I so sure about it?
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.160]   Why is it I can invite anybody, a man or a woman who may have sunk to the lowest depths
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.880]   of sin and iniquity, why can I say to you that you have as much chance as anybody else
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.240]   this second?
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.480]   On what authority do I do it?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.160]   Well in this way.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:23.080]   You see, salvation, as was shown on the day of Pentecost, does not depend in any respect
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.320]   whatsoever upon you and me.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.720]   It is all in the Lord.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.880]   It is He.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.320]   It is what He has done.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.080]   He gives it as a free gift.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.840]   As this Holy Ghost was poured out freely, He gives His salvation freely.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.900]   It's a gift without money and without price.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:51.840]   All the fitness He requireth is to see your need of Him.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   That's all.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.880]   All that is necessary is that you call, that you see where you are, that you feel your
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:06.360]   lost and helpless and you cry out unto Him to have mercy upon you.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:14.640]   So I say that the past doesn't matter, though you may have dismissed Christ and Christianity
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:20.920]   with oaths and cursing and blasphemed it.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:28.160]   If you see tonight your sin, your lost estate, you have nothing to do but to call upon the
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:37.200]   name of the Lord and I assure you that immediately you will be received.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.040]   You will be saved.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.720]   Cry out unto Him.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   Call upon Him.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:48.240]   Don't give yourself a moment's rest nor peace until you know that you're saved, that He's
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:57.440]   received you, that your sins have been blotted out, that you're reconciled to God and that
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.040]   you're destined for heaven and everlasting bliss.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:18.440]   Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and safe eternally, amen.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
