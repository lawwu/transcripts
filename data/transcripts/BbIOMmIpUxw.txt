[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - We're in a season here in the States
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.780]   faced with an incredible number of powerful men
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.240]   getting exposed for making unwanted and unwarranted
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   sexual advances on women.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.440]   Of the alleged perpetrators,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.720]   the list includes names like Harvey Weinstein
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.720]   and Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Al Franken, Roger Ailes,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.080]   Roy Moore, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Bill O'Reilly,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.000]   and Garrison Keillor.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.440]   It's on the left and on the right.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.400]   It's liberals and conservatives,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.800]   it's politicians and entertainers
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.840]   from Hollywood to Minneapolis to DC and to New York City.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.280]   It seems like what makes these stories
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.600]   especially tragic, Pastor John,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.680]   is not merely that these are powerful men
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   who took advantage of less powerful women.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.880]   It's especially tragic because as men,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.800]   that they are called by God
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.080]   to demonstrate sacrificial care for women
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400]   beyond what women are called to offer men.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600]   You've written on this in a recent article, Pastor John.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.360]   Here, simply debrief for us your thoughts,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   and especially now as you see
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.920]   the news of all these allegations.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.400]   - My point in that article and in this podcast
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.280]   is that the egalitarian assumptions in our culture
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.000]   and to a huge degree in the church as well,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.880]   have muted, silenced, nullified
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.320]   one of the means that God has designed
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.120]   for the protection and the flourishing of women,
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.580]   namely that men as men,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.520]   by virtue of their created God-given maleness,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.680]   apart from any practical competencies
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640]   that they have or don't have,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   that men as men have special responsibility
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.880]   to care for and protect and honor women
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.940]   that is different from the care and protection
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.040]   and honor that women owe men.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   That's my thesis.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.820]   That's my point.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.440]   Now, it seems to me that for decades,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.960]   Christian and non-Christian egalitarians
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.980]   have argued, have assumed, have modeled
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.320]   that peculiar roles and responsibilities
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   among men and women in the home, in the church,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   in the culture should emerge only from competencies
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.520]   rather than from a deeper reality
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.220]   rooted in who we are differently as male and female.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.000]   Whereas complementarians believe
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   that while competencies may shape
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.080]   the details of how our differing roles
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   and responsibilities are worked out,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   nevertheless, God has built in
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120]   to male and female profound and wonderful,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.240]   even mysterious differences that carry different burdens
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.680]   and different responsibilities.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620]   Let me put it another way.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.040]   If your nine-year-old son asks you,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.060]   "Daddy, what does it mean to grow up
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.100]   "and be a man and not a woman?"
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.100]   Or your daughter asks, "Mommy, what does it mean
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.000]   "to grow up and be a woman and not a man?"
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.720]   It won't do to answer,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.540]   and I've read dozens of articles that try to answer,
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.960]   it won't do to answer, "Well, it means
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.880]   "that when you grow up, you will have maturity
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.940]   "and wisdom and courage and sacrifice
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.320]   "and humility and patience and kindness
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.920]   "and strength and self-control and purity and faith
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.180]   "and hope and love," et cetera,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.180]   because that doesn't answer the question.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.380]   Those traits are absolutely right,
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.180]   but they belong to both men and women.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180]   And the question was, what does it mean
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.980]   to grow up and be a man and not a woman?
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.500]   What does it mean to grow up and be a woman and not a man?
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.320]   Is there, mommy and daddy, a God-given,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.180]   profound, beautiful meaning to manhood and womanhood?
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.660]   Kids don't say it like that,
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.180]   but that's what they wanna know eventually,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   is there a difference beyond mere anatomy?
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.860]   Are there built-in responsibilities that I have
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   simply because I'm a male or a female human being?
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   There is a pervasive, egalitarian disinclination
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.620]   to say yes to that question.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.620]   The egalitarian inclination is to define
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.620]   all our relationships by competencies.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.500]   And my suggestion or my contention is,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   this is hurting us, this refusal to answer that question
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.080]   or be burdened by it is hurting us.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.260]   It confuses everyone, especially the children,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.520]   and this confusion is hurting people.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.860]   It has moved way beyond confusion.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.820]   It's a firm conviction of most of our egalitarian culture
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.180]   that men as men do not owe women
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.900]   a special kind of care and protection and honor
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.240]   that women do not owe men.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   I believe they do, and I believe 50 years of denying it
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.260]   is one of the seeds, there are others in our culture,
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.260]   but one of the seeds that is bearing very bad fruit,
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.820]   including all those sexual abuses
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.500]   you talked about in your question.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   So let me just point to a few biblical evidences
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.660]   for believing men as men have special,
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.460]   God-intended, God-designed responsibilities
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.460]   for care and protection and honor toward women
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.020]   that women do not have toward men.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.360]   And lest I be misunderstood, of course,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.900]   there are many situations in which women
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.900]   have responsibilities to care for, protect, and honor men.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.260]   I'm simply saying that these are not the same.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.940]   Men have a special, God-given responsibility
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.640]   that comes with being a man, as a man,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.300]   not because of practical competency.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.420]   So here are, I think I've got three jotted down here,
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.400]   three pointers in the Bible.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.520]   They each take a big article to flesh out,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.380]   but here they are.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.120]   Number one, when Satan tempted Eve,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   it says in Genesis 3, 6, that Adam, quote, "was with her."
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.920]   In view of everything else that I see in Genesis 1 to 4,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.080]   and in view of the way Paul handles this issue,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.140]   this text in 1 Timothy 2, 12 following,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.880]   I think the author, the author of Genesis, Moses,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   wants us to see that part of the collapse
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.660]   of God's beautiful order in the garden
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.280]   was the failure of Adam to speak up
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.720]   and to take some initiative and deal with the devil
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.000]   and be the leader and protector
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   that God had designed him to be.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.360]   He failed, and he's been failing ever since.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.640]   And one reason Jesus came into the world
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   was to destroy that failure and cause Adam
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.040]   to own up to the fact that he's got a special burden,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.080]   a special responsibility to bear in protecting
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.480]   and caring for and honoring this woman.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.320]   That's number one.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   Number two, in Colossians 3, 19,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.680]   the apostle Paul told husbands,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   "Love your wives and do not be harsh with them."
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.960]   Now, that is not the same as saying,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.240]   "Neither of you should be harsh."
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   It is a special restraint on typical sinful,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.000]   male harshness and roughness and cruelty
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   that's gone on for thousands of years.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   And its positive counterpart is spelled out stunningly,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.300]   stunningly, beautifully, counter-culturally,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.060]   I would argue, in every culture on the planet,
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.560]   counter-culturally in Ephesians 5, 22 to 33.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.720]   There's nothing like it in any culture in the world
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.880]   that's not rooted in this text,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.720]   where leadership like Jesus and protection like Jesus
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.680]   and provision and cherishing and nourishing like Jesus
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.180]   are laid on the man as a man,
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.740]   not because he's more competent,
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.640]   but because he's a man, not interchangeable with a woman
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.720]   any more than Christ and the church are interchangeable.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.640]   And I would argue from scripture,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.180]   like the creation account and other places,
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.840]   that this special burden put on man,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   this special responsibility toward women
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.800]   for honor and care and protection
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   does not evaporate when he walks out the door of his home
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.240]   as though it were a matter of geography
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   or a matter of marriage alone.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   Manhood does not cease to be manhood outside the home.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   That's number two.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   Here's the last one.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.440]   1 Peter 3, 7, "Husbands are told to dwell with their wives
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.380]   according to knowledge."
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.120]   And then that dwelling according to knowledge
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.000]   is defined two ways.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.360]   And the first one is the one I'm concerned with
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.240]   because it's the one that applies
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.960]   whether you're Christian or not.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   The first one is based on natural differences.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.560]   The second one, fellow heirs of the grace of life,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.000]   is based on spiritual uniqueness of Christians.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.760]   Peter says, "Showing honor to the woman
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.800]   as the weaker vessel."
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.680]   Now, there are ways, of course,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.320]   that women are stronger than men
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.920]   and ways a woman are weaker than men.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.120]   And Peter is focusing on that and asking,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   "How shall a man relate to a woman if she is weaker,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.300]   more vulnerable to his power?"
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.640]   And the answer is honor, honor, honor.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.280]   And my point is that this is a peculiar,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.000]   a special honor and a kind of honor
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.680]   God has built into the man as the stronger.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   This is not merely mutual honor.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.320]   This is a special honor flowing
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.800]   from the stronger to the weaker,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   the honor of a man toward a woman
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.980]   precisely because he's a man.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.560]   And in general, men are in the position
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.840]   of physical power and strength over women.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.000]   And God inserts between them in that relationship
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   a special duty, a special responsibility that a man has.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.120]   And my point, Tony, in this article, in this podcast,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.420]   is that this divine design for men, as men,
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.840]   to show us a special care, protection, honor to women
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   is essential for good families, churches, society,
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.000]   and for women in particular.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Millions of people in our day would rather sacrifice
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.720]   this peculiar biblical mandate given for the good of women,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.220]   they would rather sacrifice it than betray any hint
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.400]   of compromise with egalitarian assumptions.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   So what I'm arguing is that we have forfeited
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.220]   both a great God-ordained restraint
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.560]   upon male vice and male power,
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.640]   and we have forfeited a great God-ordained incentive
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.320]   for male valor because we refuse to even think
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   in terms of maleness and femaleness as they are created
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.720]   by God carrying distinct and unique responsibilities
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.980]   and burdens.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.640]   We have put our hope in the myth that the summons
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.140]   to generic human virtue with no attention
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.220]   to the peculiar virtues required of manhood and womanhood
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.680]   would be sufficient to create a beautiful society
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.960]   of mutual respect.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.880]   It isn't working.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.260]   Men need to be taught from the time
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.800]   that they are little boys that part of their manhood
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   is to feel a special responsibility for the care
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.840]   and protection and honoring of women
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.760]   just because they are men.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.520]   - God's design is profound,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.600]   and these suggestions are significant.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for listening

[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.440]   and hopefully in an understandable way for our audience.

[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   Well, we're gonna break for the weekend
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.360]   and return with an interesting topic
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.520]   because Pastor John will occasionally allude
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.600]   to a dark season he faced in his early 40s.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.240]   It was a midlife crisis that was very strong.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.080]   But Pastor John, you haven't talked a lot about it.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.920]   Next time I'm gonna ask you
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.560]   to go back into this dark season
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.480]   and for you to offer counsel
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.960]   to men who are facing these midlife years
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.360]   who are 40 or close to 40.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.760]   It should be a really important episode.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.440]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.320]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.760]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.960]   (upbeat music)
