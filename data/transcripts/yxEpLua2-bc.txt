[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.720]   - Hi, welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.840]   Today I'm here with my guy, my right hand man, Nicodemus.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.800]   My manager, my trainer, security, all that, all in one.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.920]   So, I'm excited to have you on Curious Mike.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.360]   It's been a long time coming.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.840]   Yeah, so, for those of you that don't know,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.120]   we met back in college when I went to Mizzou.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.280]   He was my strength coach at the time.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040]   And we kind of developed a relationship over time there,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.480]   but nothing to what it's like now.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.800]   Kind of, what was your, from your perspective,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.480]   how was it when I committed to Mizzou,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600]   when I came there and kind of walked through,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.560]   like, what you remember from that time when I was in Mizzou?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680]   - Bro, that was a roller coaster,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.280]   because that was our first year at Mizzou.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.040]   We had just got there, obviously, with Coach Martin.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.920]   There was a ton of excitement around the program.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   And then, all of a sudden, we signed Michael Porter Jr.,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   we signed Jontae Porter, we get Blake Harris,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.080]   in addition to the guys that we already had.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440]   And automatically, America was on notice.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.640]   It was like, oh my goodness,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060]   you have to watch out for Mizzou next season.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   And then, I just remember, we go through that whole summer,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.480]   and I was really surprised at the work and the effort
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.960]   and all that that you guys put in.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.040]   Like, 'cause there's young guys,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   you see freshmen who come in,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.880]   and some of 'em have a work ethic, some of 'em don't.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.840]   But you, in particular, you were serious from day one,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.360]   specifically in the weight room.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   It was like, what is it gonna take to get better?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.440]   You did everything that was required.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.120]   You didn't necessarily like the 6 a.m.'s in the sand.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.680]   - You're getting up early like that, yeah.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.240]   - But, yeah, and then, you get to the,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.720]   everything's going well.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.520]   And then, I remember we get to that first game, right?
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.840]   And then, just something was off.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.600]   And I remember you saying that you couldn't go.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.520]   And then, we go through that whole situation, right?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   Where, right before your first game of college basketball,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.120]   due to the injury, you couldn't play.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.000]   And then, we have the ups and downs and ups and downs
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.760]   to trying to get you back out there on the court,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.000]   trying to get you ready for, really,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.600]   the next level at that point.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.400]   And then, you had that desire to come back.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.160]   So, you came back and played in the NCAA tournament game
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.560]   against Florida State, right?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   I think is who you played against.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.320]   - Yeah, no, I came back against--
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.160]   - Was it Georgia?
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.680]   - I came back against Georgia. - Georgia.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.840]   - In the SEC tournament, then Florida State.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.280]   - Florida State in the NCAA tournament.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.360]   So, there were a lot of ups and downs
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   in between, but through that whole process,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560]   you and I formed a really good relationship.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   And we stayed in contact and kept working together
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.440]   after you left to go to the NBA.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.400]   And then, shoot, here we are now.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.240]   - Yeah.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.160]   So, going back to that time,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.400]   you being a young strength coach,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.600]   you were like boys with a lot of the players, you know?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.200]   What was, you tell me sometimes about how, like,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   we would be going out, not you,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.440]   but, like, some of us would be going out,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.400]   but you would have, like, a fake Snapchat,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.560]   like, acting like you was, like, a girl,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   to, like, add the players to, like, see what we were on.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.920]   Explain your motive behind that.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   - Yeah, so, there was, I mean, you just have to get,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   I had to get creative, right?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320]   Because I think part of my responsibility
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   as the strength and conditioning coach at that time
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   was just to make sure that you guys
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.280]   were putting yourselves in position to be successful,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.200]   to be your eyes and ears for things
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.480]   that you might not know that could happen,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.640]   that are happening out in the world,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.240]   and just be as protective or as helpful as I can.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   And a part of that was understanding
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.200]   how you guys were moving around
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.400]   on the streets in the weekends.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   So, whether it was having a burner account on Snap
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.880]   or having a burner account on IG,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.840]   or even, you know, there were times
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   where befriending you all's significant others, right?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.600]   And you're saying, "Coach Nick,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.720]   "I can't believe Michael would do this,"
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.760]   or, "I can't believe Blake would do this,"
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.520]   and this and that and this and that.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.320]   You know, it was, by any means necessary,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.160]   just keeping an eye in the air to the streets
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   and figuring out, you know,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   how y'all were moving on the weekends and during the week.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.680]   - Yeah, that's funny, that's hilarious to talk about.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.720]   So, yeah, you have a very, I'd say,
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.040]   like a protective nature
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.320]   about your protective personality.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   One story in particular that I think is interesting
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.440]   is the story about your younger sister.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.440]   - Yeah. - And you talked,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.280]   you told me one time about how your younger sister,
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.720]   she was, I think it was her roommate's boyfriend
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.480]   or something, and her roommate's boyfriend, like,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.560]   disrespected your sister,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.400]   and you said you and your brother flew all the way
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.720]   to, I think-- - West Lafayette, Indiana.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.640]   - Oh, yeah, Indiana to check him.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.760]   What was that story?
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   What happened there?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.920]   Have you always kind of had a protective nature?
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.200]   Was that just something you grew up with, or what, you know?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.280]   - Yeah, because, I mean, early on, it comes from our father.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.040]   I'm one of seven.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.600]   I have an older brother, and then I have five sisters.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.920]   And, I mean, we came from very humble beginnings.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.840]   My pops moved around in the streets,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.760]   so he taught us some of those lessons
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.440]   and some of the things that were necessary
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.920]   for us to survive in the streets
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.400]   and to protect our sisters and protect our mom
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.840]   was the number one priority.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.080]   You know, even from a young age, I can remember me and G,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.920]   Gary, my older brother, were very, very young,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.240]   and my dad would always say, "When he's gone,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.200]   "my brother's the man of the house,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   "and then it's my job to help my brother
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.960]   "be in the man of the house,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.760]   "protect my mom and my sisters."
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.960]   So, from a young age, pops ingrained that in us
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.160]   over and over and over.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   So, I mean, when we didn't know what else to do,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   we knew that our responsibility
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   was always to protect our mom and our sisters.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.920]   And that was just an instance
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.120]   where my little sister, she was in college,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   and I remember getting that phone call.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.640]   She called my brother and I, and she was crying,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.840]   and then she started going off.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.480]   My sister's very independent,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.280]   so if she's to the point to where she's crying,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.720]   you know something's going down.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.360]   And I guess she had a confrontation
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.480]   with a roommate's boyfriend.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.780]   A roommate's boyfriend has some choice words.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.880]   So, my brother and I already knew what it was.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   - Nah, we need some circumstance.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.200]   - So, I mean, it was essentially a situation
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.840]   where we hopped on a plane, went to West Lafayette.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.340]   There was a confrontation.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.520]   - With him directly?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.480]   - Yeah. - Oh, really?
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.480]   And then, post-confrontation, all of his things
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.320]   were packed up in black trash bags
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.520]   and put on the street corner,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.040]   and that was the last time they had communication with him.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.160]   One of those type situations, so.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.760]   - I like it, I like it, I like it.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.000]   Nah, I can't think of any times I've really had to,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   you know, both my sisters are older,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.160]   but I can't remember any times
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.360]   me and my brothers have had to,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.280]   but we'd be on the same type of time, for sure.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.120]   - Yeah.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.320]   - Again, switching gears a little bit,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.280]   I wanna get into this book that you recently wrote.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.120]   - Yeah.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.960]   - So, you wrote a book.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   First of all, what was your motivation
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.320]   behind writing the book, and what is it about?
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.960]   - Yeah, so it was, shoot,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   over the last 14, 15 years, right,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.760]   working with collegiate athletes,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.260]   working with professional athletes,
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.000]   working with businessmen and businesswomen,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.800]   you see people who reach this pinnacle of success,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.840]   of what we define as success,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.160]   but behind the scenes, they still, for some reason,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.600]   are never able to find peace.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.960]   So, like, that concept just,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.740]   I almost became obsessed with it.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.520]   So, I challenged myself.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.040]   I was like, for the next year, every single day,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.600]   I had to spend an hour a day studying peace
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.960]   to really figure out what it was,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.640]   how do you find it, how do you help people achieve it,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.600]   and then I ended up, it was over a year straight,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.840]   over a year, 365 days straight,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   where I studied peace and it kept going,
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.980]   but through that study, I came to realize that order,
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.800]   the word order, order was a prerequisite to peace.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.040]   So, when people are able to find order in their lives,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.880]   then that sets them up to have peace, right?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.000]   And that word peace, if you look at it,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.480]   if you look at the etymology of it,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.840]   it's so rich in meaning.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   It means wholeness, it means health,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.960]   it means prosperity, which means to move forward.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.920]   It means protection, it means completion.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.480]   So, when you have order in your life,
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.280]   you set yourself up to have a healthier life,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.360]   to have a more prosperous life, to have all these things.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.300]   So, it was just through my studies,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.280]   through experience in life with guys like you
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.560]   and seeing this struggle to find peace
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   and finding out that order was a prerequisite,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.720]   I was like, yo, this is something
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.800]   that I want to share with others,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.200]   specifically people who are in your situation.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.300]   So, I knew from the beginning,
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.100]   it wasn't gonna be a traditional book,
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.100]   but I've been practicing journaling for over 10 years now,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.160]   and then it clicked.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   It was like, well, I believe in the,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.320]   there's this concept called instinctive elaboration,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.140]   where if you ask a questions,
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.560]   questions for even a quick second, hijack the brain,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.840]   and you have an opportunity to be introspective
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.880]   and to just practice self-examination.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.040]   So, the way that I decided to do it
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   is to ask a series of 17 very introspective questions
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.640]   to where you have to look yourself in the mirror.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.920]   And the hope is that as you find your identity
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.580]   over the course of answering those seven questions
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.340]   and start to establish order in your life,
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.120]   then that's where you can really start to walk in the peace
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.840]   that we should all be walking in.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   - So, peace, identity, all these words that you're using,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.240]   I feel like are words that are super important
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.880]   to a person of faith, a person of God.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   I feel like people that kind of are in the world
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.320]   trying to do what the world is doing,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.060]   their goals would be more happiness,
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.200]   or their goals would be more pleasure,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.320]   but you used the word peace.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.560]   So, how would you say peace differs from happiness?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.120]   'Cause you said like,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.360]   you found that even some of the most successful people,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.880]   they were lacking in peace,
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.000]   which is something I've seen too.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.560]   Some of the most happiest people,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.800]   most famous people, most rich people,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.720]   peace is the thing that they're lacking,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.960]   but it's also the thing that they don't know how to find.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.020]   So, how would you say peace differs from happiness?
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.680]   - Well, I would say that,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.160]   obviously happiness is an emotion.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.040]   One of the words that pops in my mind
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.200]   that's synonymous with peace,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.440]   if you look at the, like I said,
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.920]   the etymology of that word peace is fulfillment, right?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.120]   You see people all the time who are quote unquote
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.440]   at this pinnacle of success,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.120]   and then they're depressed, or they're committing suicide,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.000]   or they're lacking fulfillment.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.960]   That word peace to be complete, to be whole,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   fulfillment is something that alludes so many people.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.460]   So, whether you wanna think of it as the word peace,
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.360]   or even wellness, or fulfillment,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.120]   I think all of us were placed on this earth
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.320]   to fulfill something,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   and that's why I use the word identity,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.520]   because you have to know who you are,
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.020]   and what your identity is,
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.400]   and what you were placed here to do
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.640]   in order to fulfill that.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.760]   So, you can make a billion dollars,
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.200]   but not be doing the thing that you were created to do,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.680]   and you don't have fulfillment.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.600]   You can be the best CEO,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.400]   but at home, your life is in turmoil, right?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.840]   Because you focus so much on the professional accolades
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.840]   that you forgot that you had a wife and kids at home.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.480]   You know, it's interesting you asked that question.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.880]   I saw a quote the other day.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.620]   It said that in 20 years from now,
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.240]   the only person or the only people
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.100]   that are gonna remember that you worked overtime
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.800]   are your kids.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.440]   And that hit me differently, right?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.520]   Because you see, I see it all the time,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.160]   these people who grind, grind, grind, grind, grind,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.760]   they work, work, work, and they find something,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.480]   what I think they do is they reach an achievement,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.600]   it's not success.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.980]   Because success can't just be external,
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.280]   it can't just be money.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.600]   There's two parts to success,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   there's the internal part and the external part.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.120]   So, yes, there's the joy and the happiness and all that,
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.640]   but you don't wanna have that and be broke.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.400]   So, I think that that's why I love the word fulfillment
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.080]   is because I'm having professional success,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.040]   but I'm also having personal success,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.900]   relational success, psychological success,
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.700]   so it's like the whole complete picture coming together.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.120]   - From my experience, and I don't know what you think,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.560]   peace is something that, like it talks in the Bible
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.120]   about it's something you search for,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.440]   but then it's something that you work to keep,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.680]   like you work to maintain peace.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.840]   So, it's something that can come and go.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.660]   What are the main ways, I mean, you talk about order,
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.900]   but what are the practical ways
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.000]   you think that you can maintain peace?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.120]   Do you think it's the routine, it's the habits,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.240]   or it's waking up early?
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.960]   What do you think, if you had to give a few practical ways
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.080]   where you can maintain peace,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.000]   regardless of the ups and downs of life?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.600]   - Number one, find your identity.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.360]   I think that everything that is set apart
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.380]   or set aside for you is in your identity,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.260]   because when you find out who you are,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.200]   then you'll find out why you're here,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.880]   and then that's where you start to prioritize your time
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.020]   and your effort towards that, right?
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.600]   So, I think identity is,
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.080]   finding your identity is so important.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.600]   I think we're suffering from an identity crisis in the world
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.840]   because everybody is putting on these false identities,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.000]   especially guys like you, you have fans telling you,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.240]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.380]   You have friends telling you,
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.520]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.480]   You have an organization telling you,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.580]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.560]   You have a family telling you,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.380]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.700]   But it's like, at what point
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.600]   do you actually find that identity?
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.480]   Me being a believer,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.800]   I believe that we get our identity from God.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.760]   I believe in this concept of original intent,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.560]   where it's like he originally intended for us
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.400]   to be something, to do something,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.080]   to expand his kingdom on earth.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.600]   So, I think that everything starts
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.480]   with finding the right identity.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.240]   I think the second thing is making sure
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.840]   that you have the right influences around you,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.360]   because who you're with and who you're around
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.800]   will significantly impact the decisions you make.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.160]   Interesting thing about that,
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.720]   I had a conversation probably about a year ago
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.840]   with a guy by the name of Dr. Mehran Serf.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   He's a world-renowned neuroscientist.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.240]   I was actually listening to the playback
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.080]   of our conversation this morning.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.000]   And one of the things that he talked about,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.640]   his big thing is human behavior and changing human behavior.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.240]   And he said that one of the biggest things
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.960]   that you can do to impact human behavior
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   is this concept of proximity, right?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.200]   He said that the brain actually has the ability
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.160]   to learn through osmosis.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.880]   So, the example he gave me, he was like,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.760]   "If you wanna be a better comedian,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.120]   you can go read a book about a thousand jokes,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.000]   or you can go spend time with a comedian.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.720]   And if you go spend time with a comedian
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.840]   because you're in proximity to them,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.680]   you'll learn how to be a comedian."
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.500]   So, I think identity, I think influence,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.960]   I think instructions, I'm big.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.160]   So, instructions for me are just like those habits
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.120]   and those principles and those things
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.280]   that we live by that guide us.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.560]   You know me, I'm big on habits, I'm big on discipline.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.320]   So, I think that making sure
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.360]   that you're following some type of principles
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.220]   and you're willing to stick to those principles,
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.720]   I think that those things lead to peace.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.680]   And then there's additionally,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.600]   there's a scripture in the Bible that also says,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.680]   "Wisdom's paths are peace."
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.000]   So, when you practice wisdom, then that path leads to peace.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.880]   So, I think that it's important
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.320]   that you're following the right instructions
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   and your principles and you're applying those principles.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.080]   And when you apply them, you'll have peace, excuse me.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   So, identity, influence, and instructions.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in my life,
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.680]   when I've applied those things,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.240]   sometimes better, sometimes worse.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.840]   But when I'm doing them consistently,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   that's when I have most peace,
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.160]   regardless of the good games, the bad games.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.480]   But like you said, I feel like our culture
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.800]   and a lot of young people, you know,
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.360]   it's an identity crisis.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   I feel like even the people that are doing these things,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.800]   maybe they are using Instagram
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.680]   and that's their whole job or whatever.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.920]   I just feel like there's a lot of people
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.520]   that are doing things in life right now
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.680]   that don't align with their purpose.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.520]   Like you said, you believe everyone
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.680]   was put on here for a purpose.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.040]   So, how do you think you find your purpose?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.960]   For me, I mean, I've always been told,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.680]   like you evaluate kind of your skillset.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.520]   - Yeah.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.360]   - What you're good at.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.000]   And then at the end of the day,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.840]   like if you're a believer,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.280]   you believe that the main thing is to push the kingdom,
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.720]   draw more people to God.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   But how do you think?
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.880]   'Cause I just know, man, there's a lot of young people.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.760]   I got a lot of friends who, you know, even me,
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.400]   I know if I didn't make it in basketball
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.520]   or like it for some reason,
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.720]   if one of those injuries was career ending,
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.240]   like I don't know where I would have gone from there.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.920]   I don't know how I would have used,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.400]   'cause I've always felt like my gift was basketball.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.520]   So, even talking to the people who felt,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.560]   or they grew up doing one thing
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.440]   and then they didn't make it to where they wanted to
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.920]   and now they're having to shift their whole life.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.240]   Like, how do you find your purpose?
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.120]   Because I just feel like, man,
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.040]   a lot of people are walking around here
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.360]   doing things they don't wanna do.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.280]   They have jobs they don't wanna have.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.680]   And I mean, that's a depressing thought.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.400]   I'm glad, you know, basketball worked out for me,
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.840]   but it could have easily not.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.920]   So, how do you find what you're placed on earth for?
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.800]   - Yeah, you know, so that reminds me of a,
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.040]   I was watching an interview,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.200]   this was probably some years ago,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.240]   and it was Virgil Abloh, who before his passing,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.480]   he was at one of the Ivy League schools
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160]   and he was doing an interview.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.000]   And somehow they got on the topic of purpose
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.280]   and he had said it so clearly in a way that stuck with me.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.600]   And he said, "Find your through line."
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.640]   So, what essentially your through line is,
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.040]   is you look over the course of your life
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   and there's this string of something
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   that you just couldn't shake, right?
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.240]   And in looking at that through line, you'll find purpose.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.920]   And the thing that I added to that,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.440]   that I started to realize is,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.640]   oftentimes we get mad at the frustrations that we have,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   but I think your unique frustrations
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.840]   are a clue as to what your purpose is.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   Like for me, for example, I can't,
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.320]   the thing that keeps me up at night is when I see need
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.960]   or when I see somebody who is suffering
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.360]   from some type of disorder or dysfunction
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.720]   or has chaos in their life.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.520]   So, from a young age, my mom will tell you,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.560]   like I always had a heart for the homeless people
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.880]   or people who were dealing with some type of dysfunction.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.480]   So, over the whole course of my life,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.080]   need has bothered me
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.200]   or disorder and dysfunction has bothered me.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.240]   So, I think you look at your unique frustrations,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.040]   obviously your unique abilities,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.160]   like there's something that you can do
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.240]   that surpasses the average skill level, right?
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.500]   You have a unique ability to do something.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.360]   I think there's, I heard an acronym before
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.720]   for finding your purpose, it's called SHAPE.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.480]   So, you look at your spiritual gifts, right?
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.880]   You look at your heart, the unique passions that you have.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.360]   You look at your unique abilities and your attitudes.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.120]   P stands for personality.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.000]   I think that each of us have some unique aspects
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   to our personality that make us who we are.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   If I'm giving an example for myself, very introverted,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.600]   prefer to be behind the camera,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.360]   behind the scenes and all that.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.080]   Why is that important for my purpose
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   is because it was my introvertedness
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.060]   that pushed me to be okay with,
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.220]   instead of moving around this way or that way,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.520]   just be at the crib studying, right?
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.360]   And soaking in this information
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.080]   and learning how to apply this information
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.280]   so that I can help young guys like you.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.520]   So, I think that, and then E is experiences.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   So, you look at the unique experiences
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.400]   that you've had over the course of your life.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.520]   And if you look at all those, your personality,
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.560]   unique abilities, unique frustrations, unique experiences,
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.080]   and even educationally,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.840]   the things that you just have a knack for doing.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   If you look at all those,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.000]   those are all clues that point towards why you're here.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.200]   And I think most importantly is,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.240]   with regards to the identity crisis,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.000]   is you have to connect to the right source.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.040]   That's why, for me, my belief is so important
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.960]   because I can't get my identity from the outside world.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.240]   Like, I can't get my identity from social media.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.400]   I can't get my identity from popular culture.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.860]   I can't get my identity from anything else
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.440]   because it's a flawed identity.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.280]   - 100%.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.300]   So, I think one thing that,
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.480]   this is just a random thing I came up with
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.560]   as we're talking about peace.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.200]   One thing I've always struggled with
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.000]   with people who claim to be Christians
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.440]   is I feel like Christians are sometimes
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.600]   some of the people that lack the most peace.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.480]   And I look at other religious people around the world
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   or some of these people practicing this New Age spirituality
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.680]   or the people that, even sometimes atheists,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.520]   and I look at them and I'm like,
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.280]   "Man, they're more sometimes appear to be more peaceful
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.600]   "than Christians."
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.520]   And I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   I think it might be because of the,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.480]   when you do accept God and you accept Christ into your life,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.880]   there will be a pull.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.060]   It'll be the spirit versus the flesh.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.040]   And you kinda gotta pick one.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.480]   That's why it says if you're a lukewarm Christian,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.800]   that's the most miserable place to be
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.240]   because you'll be lacking so much peace
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.640]   because you're getting pulled in two different directions.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   So, I think in our world now today,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   I feel like part of the reason Christians in general
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.760]   lack so much peace is they're lukewarm.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.920]   They never, they don't,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.580]   and I'm talking to myself as well,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.280]   they didn't go fully in committing to God
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.800]   and His ways and His principles
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.880]   and what the Bible says is right.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.160]   But they also don't feel comfortable
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.600]   doing all the stuff the world says is okay.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.920]   And so they lack so much peace.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.480]   And I just feel like that's a place
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.760]   that a lot of people are in the world today.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.720]   What is your perspective on Christian people lacking peace?
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   Do you think it's 'cause of the lukewarmness
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.880]   or where do you think that comes from?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.400]   - I think that reminds me of a quote my dad gave me.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.320]   He told me, he told us early on,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.120]   he said, "Your religion will take you to hell."
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.160]   So he taught us early on that,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   obviously we're Christians and that's our faith,
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.200]   but he told us the most important thing
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.600]   is your relationship with God.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.440]   Because we know whether it's a physical relationship
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.920]   or whatever type of relationship we wanna apply it to,
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.000]   as you grow in that relationship
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.160]   and you start to become more intimate
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.120]   and you start to find new revelations
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.680]   of this and that and this and that,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.800]   then there is a certain level of peace that comes with that.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.720]   There's a certain level,
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.480]   specifically with our relationship with God
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.000]   is as we start to submit to Him
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.320]   and His plan and His purpose
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.440]   and actually spend time with Him,
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.640]   then He starts to reveal certain things to us.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.280]   I think when you start to talk about religion,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.160]   religion for some people is just a habit.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.680]   It's like, I go to church,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.360]   I sing a couple of worship songs,
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.280]   I pray before I eat,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.320]   but there's no real execution on the principles.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.480]   So it goes back to when I talked about
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.360]   following the right instructions.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.920]   It's okay, it's one thing to read the scripture
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.600]   and it's another thing to actually apply the principles
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.760]   that are in the scripture.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.320]   And I think you and I have talked about this a million times
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.240]   like sometimes now that I'm in the position that I'm in
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.280]   and we'll be sitting in meetings
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.680]   and this and that and this and that.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.480]   So I think sometimes I've seen business,
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.960]   businessmen and businesswomen, CEOs,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   who apply biblical principles better than Christians do.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.720]   - Right. - Right?
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.160]   It's the application of the principle.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.880]   So it's one thing to go to church
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.600]   and it's one thing to receive the gift of salvation,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.800]   but there's a whole nother thing
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.040]   about walking this thing out daily
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.240]   and applying the principles.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.640]   Because principles are important.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.400]   There's the way that Dr. Miles Monroe, I'll never forget it.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.360]   He said, "Every principle has a if-then clause."
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.280]   So if I do this, then this happens.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.440]   The business world applies those principles
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.080]   because they know if, for example,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   if I keep my balance sheet in order, then X, Y, Z happens.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.480]   But in Christianity,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.400]   we don't necessarily follow those principles
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.080]   or execute on them.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.960]   - I agree.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.760]   Talk a little bit about a morning routine
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.160]   on the more practical side again,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.560]   because I feel like as important as all these topics are,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.720]   like sometimes people that are super busy
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.440]   or make themselves too busy,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.960]   it's very hard to get to the place where you're applying
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   the things that you need to
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.880]   in order to live the life you want to live.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.160]   There is a practical side of,
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.960]   I need to spend time in the Word.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.600]   I need to fill myself up.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.720]   I need to have this time to journal.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.400]   So I think personally, from my experience,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.440]   the morning time is so good.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.900]   I heard a quote one time,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.240]   you don't tune the instrument after the concert.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.520]   You tune it before.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.960]   So that's first thing in the morning.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.800]   You make sure you're in the right headspace
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   to go be the person you want to be,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.480]   go make the decisions you want to make.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.080]   And I know you're big on a morning routine.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.440]   So just for the people that are listening,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.200]   that they want to change their life
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.080]   and they want to be more disciplined and install new habits.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.360]   How important is a morning routine?
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.600]   And kind of walk through yours.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.640]   - Yeah, for me, it's extremely important
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.400]   because I heard a quote before.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.200]   You can't be serious about life and serious about purpose
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.680]   and practice apathy in most areas of your life.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800]   So in order to be serious about life
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.160]   and actively transform your life and change your life,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.960]   it requires intentionality.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.600]   You have to be intentional in every area of your life.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.520]   So what that looks like for me
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.120]   is I just made a decision early on.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.760]   I can't just let the day happen to me.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.640]   And the way that I put it is I have to create the day.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.680]   Like that's my goal every single day is to create the day.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.960]   Don't let the day happen to me.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.160]   And what that looks like,
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.660]   what that looks like is taking control of my day.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.800]   So it might look like waking up at 5 a.m., right?
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.840]   So like I joke about it all the time,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.760]   but I know you're gonna wake,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.480]   you usually wake up around 8, 8.30.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.080]   My Nicodemus usually wakes up about 7, 7.30.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.720]   So I know I need to get everything done before then
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.640]   so that I can be completely available for Nicodemus,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.160]   be completely available for you
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.520]   and completely available for any other thing
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.560]   that I need to take care of that day.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.520]   So that requires me to wake up first thing in the morning.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   What I do is now I go get in the cold plunge.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   So first things first,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.060]   wake up, go straight to the cold plunge three minutes, right?
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.960]   That's gonna do a million different things,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.780]   but the biggest thing for me strengthens my immune system,
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.160]   helps with mental clarity first thing in the morning,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.040]   resets my circadian rhythm
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.700]   so that I get better sleep at night.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.480]   So I start there, it wakes me up,
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.900]   and then I'll do red light therapy for about 10 minutes.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.920]   But I'm big on stacking habits
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.600]   because there's a million habits that you can practice.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.880]   But for me, it's like, which ones can I stack?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.400]   So while I'm doing 10 minutes of red light therapy,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.800]   I'll either play worship music and worship,
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.960]   or that's my 10 minutes of uninterrupted prayer.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.040]   Because I think in order for me to maintain my identity,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.300]   I have to connect to my source, right?
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.600]   So just like we wouldn't go on a road trip
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.800]   and leave our charger at home,
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.420]   I have to get charged up first thing every morning.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.680]   You and I have talked about that
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.320]   from a discipline standpoint.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.940]   Sometimes you ask me, "How can you,
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.200]   "how do you stay so disciplined
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.680]   "and not do this and not do that?"
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.640]   And I tell you, I'm just like everybody else.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.760]   I just make sure that I connect to the source
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.840]   first thing in the morning
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.720]   so that I have the right perspective
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.080]   and I know I need to get connected to the source.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.600]   So it's one day to the next.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.380]   So cold plunge, red light therapy with prayer and worship,
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.800]   and then start knocking off stuff off my to-do list.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.040]   And then once Nicodemus wakes up,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.580]   then that's usually like from seven to,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.340]   I drop him off at daycare around 8.30.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.580]   That is my, I'm completely for the most part unavailable.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.140]   Like that's his time.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.740]   So we'll make breakfast together.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.060]   We'll sit, like he knows already.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.220]   He'll, we'll watch worship.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.300]   So we'll listen to one worship song
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.400]   and then we'll do one educational activity.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.380]   Like for him right now, he's learning Spanish.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.680]   So we'll watch like 30 minutes of Spanish while he's eating,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.380]   but we'll make breakfast together.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.380]   And then after that, throughout the day,
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.280]   I set aside time for working out
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.960]   and professional development and all that.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.980]   But that morning routine of getting the cold,
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.100]   red light therapy, prayer and worship,
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.920]   and then sunlight exposure.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.460]   So then I'll walk out before he wakes up.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.180]   If the sun is out, 10 minutes in the sun,
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.940]   and that's my time of gratitude.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.260]   So I've knocked out mind, body, and spirit together.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.920]   And it takes about 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.780]   And that's how I start my day.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.720]   - That's amazing.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.080]   I like what you said about connecting
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.900]   to the power source as well,
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.360]   because it's such a biblical principle
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.460]   of God gives you enough, like for the day.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.440]   Like you can do that routine for a year straight.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.600]   And then if you took three or four days off,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.560]   you wouldn't feel right because,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.380]   or like even talking about like getting in the Word
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.300]   or your prayer time, you can pray for three days in a row,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.280]   but that's not gonna last you for that fourth day.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.480]   It's like a daily.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.280]   And the Bible, you know,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.640]   God gave them enough manna for one day,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   and then it would go rotten.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.220]   They would have to go recollect it the next day.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.240]   I forget which guy it was,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.440]   but he would go into prayer three times a day
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.000]   to reconnect, to refill himself up.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.240]   So it's not like, it's a daily walk,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.280]   and it's a daily habit.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.480]   And sometimes for me,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.640]   and I think a lot of other people, it's like,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   you know, you might be doing so good
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.760]   in how you wanna be and what you wanna do
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.840]   for a week straight,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.720]   but it's like a cycle.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.280]   You go through these ups and downs of,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.000]   you do good, then you don't do good.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.060]   Then you crawl out of it and you do good,
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.900]   then you don't do good.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.960]   And I think that's that chaos in your life.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.160]   If you can create the like, the order,
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.380]   then you'll see like the consistency
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.960]   and who you wanna be.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   And I just think that I've seen it so much in my life
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.240]   because I hate the cycle
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.980]   'cause I feel like a lot of people feel helpless
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.700]   when they're doing good
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.360]   or they're being who they wanna be for a couple of weeks,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.440]   and then man, they have a bad three or four days,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.720]   and then they start binging on something for a few days,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.920]   and they crawl out of it.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.580]   That's like the worst place to be in.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.420]   - It's hard.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.960]   Another part of that word order
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.880]   from the etymology of it is prioritization.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   And that's why I do that.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.560]   I do the first things first.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.640]   Journaling is a part of my morning routine,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.360]   obviously, as well.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.200]   And I know you're big on journaling,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.660]   but it's like, I have to do the first things first.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.800]   I have to set something as a priority,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.660]   and then everything else falls in line.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.400]   So for me, like I said, it's connecting to God,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.640]   it's spending time in worship,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.520]   it's spending time with Nicodemus,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.760]   it's spending time making sure
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.040]   that I'm taking care of myself
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.960]   so that I can provide the best,
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.120]   whatever it is, to the world.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.240]   And then along the lines of what you said,
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.320]   from a biblical perspective,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.600]   one of the most profound things
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   that I had ever seen in the scripture
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.580]   is that when Jesus started His ministry,
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.840]   we see the story of Him being baptized by John the Baptist,
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.760]   and that represents Him beginning His ministry.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.920]   And then that story goes,
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.320]   there's a dove that comes down from heaven,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.760]   and God says, "This is my Son in whom I'm well pleased."
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.120]   So that stuck with me,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.200]   because I realized that before Jesus took the steps
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.960]   to walk in His ministry,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.200]   He received affirmation from the Father.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.660]   And I just took that for me,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.460]   that if I receive affirmation from God,
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.040]   I never have to function for affirmation from others.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   Period.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.320]   So it's either we're functioning from a place of affirmation
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.920]   or you're functioning for affirmation.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.240]   And that's super hard for y'all.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.520]   - Which is our whole life, I mean--
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.360]   - Everything.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.180]   - Our whole life,
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.680]   because you just have so much criticism,
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.060]   you have so much nitpicking on how you played.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.900]   - All of it.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.720]   - But everything.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.160]   I mean, if you're on social media,
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.360]   if you're posting pictures, what is that really for?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.080]   That's usually for affirmation.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.920]   - For sure.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.560]   - 'Cause 99% of people, or maybe probably higher,
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.080]   live from a place of affirmation.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.480]   That's such an unstable place,
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.400]   'cause it's like, man, you're at the mercy of other people.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.860]   If you're an athlete, it's the worst.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.840]   You got these young dudes, one of my good friends,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.280]   retiring at such a young age,
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.560]   because they feel that pressure and they feel that anxiety,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.200]   because they're getting their worth.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.960]   And I feel like that only comes
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.320]   because they're playing for affirmation.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.880]   They're getting their worth from basketball.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.400]   And I mean, every athlete struggles with it,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.760]   'cause it's such high stakes.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.360]   It feels like the world's on your shoulders sometimes.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.740]   So many people watch the games,
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.840]   but yeah, for guys in our position,
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   that would be a game changer.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.560]   And then it lets you play more free.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.400]   - Free.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.760]   - It lets you, you're not playing
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.280]   to get the applause from the fans,
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.720]   to get the people commenting on your pictures
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.600]   after your game on Instagram.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.160]   You're just hooping 'cause you want to hoop,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.000]   and you know that's a gift God gave you.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.280]   And that frees you up to then play better.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.480]   And it gives you a focus for your performance, right?
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.920]   So it's like, I'm not performing for your applause.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.240]   I'm not performing for your cheers,
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.840]   'cause I've already been affirmed from the Father.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.120]   And the way that that looks like,
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.880]   I always try to take biblical principles
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.840]   and make it practical.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.160]   The way that I practice it with Nicodemus,
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.920]   he's only three years old.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.160]   And before, like every day we'll do one activity
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.000]   when he gets home.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.200]   Right now it's basketball or soccer.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.920]   So before we even start the activity,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.680]   I tell him, I love him and I'm proud of you.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.960]   I was like, you know, Dada loves you.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.880]   You know, I'm proud of you, right?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.080]   So I never, so he never has to come to me
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.680]   and ask me if I'm proud of him
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.600]   because of how well he played.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.240]   So I always, and I told myself,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.160]   like I have this list in my phone
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.120]   of things that I have to do.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.360]   And that's one of the things.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.520]   I always affirm him before the activity,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.160]   even if it's a learning activity,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   'cause he's at the age now where he's like,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.720]   Dada, are you proud of me?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.080]   And I remind him, I said, son,
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.280]   I was proud of you before we even started.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.880]   Remember Dada told you he loved you?
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   I told you I was proud of you.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.280]   So now, 'cause he's three and he's already,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.320]   are you proud of me?
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.280]   Dada, give me a high five.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.840]   I told you that before we started.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.760]   So you don't ever have to perform for that
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.440]   'cause you've already been affirmed before.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.880]   - Right, that's cool.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.200]   One thing I want to touch on
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.800]   that I think is really unique about you is
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.000]   because you are, and one of the reasons
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.080]   that I, you know, wanted you in my life
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.000]   is because I felt like I always kind of lacked in,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.320]   I'm disciplined in certain areas.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.480]   You know, I'm disciplined in the weight room
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.640]   and on the court, things like that,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.960]   but I'm undisciplined and I'm very unintentional
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.920]   in other areas, and I saw that in you.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.320]   So you've been like this for a long time,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.640]   one of the most disciplined people, you know,
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   very habit-oriented.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.680]   You have never had a sip of alcohol
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.840]   and you've never smoked or any of that in your life.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.880]   Where did that come from and how do you keep that up?
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.680]   I think you even said you've never even
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.160]   seen pornography before.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   - Like, how did, yeah, how is that possible?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.640]   - Well, younger years, it was a promise
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.640]   that I made to my mom, right?
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.200]   And then you get older, you get past the adolescence
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   and you have a decision on your own.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.000]   - But talk about, I mean, you were in a frat, you know?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.840]   - Yeah.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.560]   - They have the initiation and stuff like that.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.440]   How did you stay strong in all of these convictions
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.280]   that you had and, yeah?
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.080]   - Bro, it's crazy that I don't, I don't know.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.920]   I think it's always been from a young age,
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:13.360]   my never wanting to disappoint God and my parents.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.240]   And you know me now, like that might be
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.200]   one of my greatest weaknesses is
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.520]   I don't like disappointing people, right?
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.760]   So it's like, you'll sacrifice everything for others
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.240]   just so that you don't disappoint them.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   And then sometimes you can end up losing yourself.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.200]   That's a whole nother story, but it was,
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.600]   I never wanted to disappoint my parents.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.560]   I never wanted to disappoint God.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.480]   I remembered how hard life was early on
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.040]   and I never wanted to go back to that.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   And I just associated things like drinking, smoking,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.080]   getting caught up in this and that and this and that
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.560]   as not leading me in the right direction, right?
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.960]   Because for me, I think discipline is simply
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.560]   knowing what to say yes to and what to say no to.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.520]   So I always, I just made a decision early on,
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.600]   I was gonna say yes to, I knew that
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.680]   I was created to do something special.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.600]   I didn't know what it was, but I'd always ask myself,
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.720]   is this gonna get me closer to whatever it is
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.000]   that I'm supposed to do?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.600]   Or is it gonna get me further away?
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.400]   It wasn't hard, being in a fraternity,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.920]   being a part of Phi Beta Sigma,
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.760]   on the campus of Baylor University,
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.600]   like it wasn't, it's not easy, but I did it.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.320]   I was fortunate though, in that my closest circle of friends
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.440]   to this day, Curtis Opara, Nathaniel Higgins,
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.600]   my brother Gary, for a little while,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.920]   I had some very, very close friends who,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.480]   they all accepted me for who I was though too.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.360]   They were always like, "Nicodemus doesn't do that,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.720]   "that's not what he does," and they let me be me.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.800]   I think I told you, and I realized early on
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.080]   how important having the right people in your ecosystem is,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.160]   because they never, it was easy because obviously
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.800]   my brother knew what I was all about,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.640]   and we went to Baylor together, so he was right there.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.280]   But then when you have friends, and they also know
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.000]   that's not what Nicodemus is about, 'cause I said it,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.960]   I made it known early on, and they never,
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.840]   I didn't really have to deal with that peer pressure
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.120]   from them, 'cause they knew what it was.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   So my friends helped me stay consistent,
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.360]   because I wasn't getting that 24/7 pressure from them.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.520]   It was a little bit easier then.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.360]   I think when I was in college is when Facebook
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   really started getting poppin', so I didn't have
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.800]   like the pressure to be cool on social,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.300]   and to socially do this and that, and this and that.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.760]   But I just, I knew early on, my mom tells me this story
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.640]   all the time, at like four years old,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.100]   I would stand on the table in a restaurant,
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.720]   and my name is Nicodemus, which is the story
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.740]   of Nicodemus going to Jesus by night,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.760]   and Jesus saying, "You must be born again."
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.400]   So I would stand on the table and be like,
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.480]   "You must be born again," right?
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.320]   This is before I even know, so I just,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.840]   I knew that there was a calling on my life early,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.800]   and I just tried to do everything that I could.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.720]   You and I have talked about it, I made a million mistakes.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.640]   You know, there's a million other mistakes
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.880]   that you can make other than smoking, and drinking,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.480]   and watching pornography, those are just the three
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.940]   that I've had the mental fortitude not to do.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.640]   - And now you're married, you know,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   you got little Nicodemus, and I've seen it.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.880]   We'll be out, you know, and there's sometimes girls around,
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.400]   and things like that, and they'll approach you,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.640]   they'll come up to you, and, "Are you single?
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.400]   "My friend really likes you," things like that.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.160]   And not even just athletes, but the majority of men,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.320]   when they have, you know, pretty girls approaching them,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.720]   and things like that, it is very hard,
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.240]   especially, you know, you're on the road,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.160]   got your own hotel room, you know,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.000]   you could do something, nobody knows about it.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.200]   Like, I know that's something that in my profession,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.680]   and just in my realm of, that's something
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.760]   that people struggle with, you know?
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.000]   I really respect a dude who gets married,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.720]   and then he stays faithful, because for me,
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.340]   I'm not getting married until I've developed the discipline
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.360]   to know for a fact I could be faithful to one woman
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.720]   for the rest of my life, but you,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.600]   I've seen it over and over.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.840]   You kind of, like, have a firm, like, barrier, like, no.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.480]   And you're cool with a lot of these girls.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.240]   Like, you're friends with females, and things like that,
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.040]   but it never crosses a certain line.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.960]   Is that discipline that you have to develop?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.600]   Or is it just something you've always had?
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.760]   Or is it like a daily, is it like a daily thing?
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.800]   - Right, it's getting connected to that source
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   first thing in the morning.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.880]   'Cause when we talk about discipline, I tell you,
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.040]   like, I have to stay connected to God.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.320]   'Cause apart from Him, shoot,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.440]   there's nothing under the sun that I wouldn't do, 100%.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.960]   Like, most people, they'll put up this fake facade.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.080]   I'm just like everybody else.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.040]   The only thing that keeps me set apart is the fact
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.880]   that I connect to God on a daily basis,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.120]   and get a vision for my life, and just say yes
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.040]   to what leads me to that vision,
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.720]   and no to what takes me away from that vision.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.520]   And then, you've heard me talk about Dr. Miles Monroe.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.760]   I think I quoted him earlier.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.640]   He said something that stuck with me
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.000]   that I heard years ago.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.280]   He said, "Make sure that your private life
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.560]   "is safe enough for public consumption."
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.400]   - 100%.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   - And you look at some of the greatest athletes
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   in the world, you look at some of the greatest CEOs
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.600]   in the world, you look at some of the greatest politicians
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.320]   in the world, at some point,
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.080]   what happened in the dark came to light.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.640]   - Is that the dude that you gave me his book?
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.840]   - The book, yeah, "Kingdom Principles," yeah.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.360]   - Well, there was one, there was a book,
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.200]   I think you might have given me.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.840]   - "The Power and Character of Leadership."
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.680]   - Yeah, is that him?
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.760]   - Yeah, he wrote that book as well, yeah.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.120]   - Because I was reading that book,
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.680]   and it was so true that it doesn't matter
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.240]   how big you get, how much money you have,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.760]   how much influence you have,
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.400]   like, you can lose so much credibility,
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.960]   you can lose all these things in a moment of weakness,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.400]   and I know for a lot of dudes, for a lot of dudes,
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.520]   it's the lust thing, you know, they got a wife,
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.240]   but, you know, they may slip up here or here,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.640]   or, and it's just, it's such a hard thing
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.360]   to keep intact, and, you know, I joke around
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.400]   a lot about, maybe we weren't supposed to be monogamous,
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.120]   you know, maybe, like, you know, back in the day
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.480]   when these dudes had all these wives
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.760]   and all these concubines, like,
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.200]   it really is against our biology
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   to be with one woman, like, the rest of our life,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.040]   like, that takes a certain amount of discipline,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.480]   it really does, and I see it from you,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.240]   and I've seen it from my dad, so I know it's possible,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.960]   but a lot of guys, they never get that discipline,
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.840]   and I just think, like, in this day and age,
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.240]   like, marriage is not really, like,
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.840]   a coveted thing anymore, like, it's like,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.600]   people don't really want that, you know,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.920]   and it's just, it's cool to see.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.040]   - It's not easy, though, bro, it's difficult,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.720]   but like I said, you have to stay connected to the source,
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   and you have to have something that's greater than that,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.200]   because you think about it, like,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   you sleep with one woman while you're married,
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.560]   what's gonna stop you from sleeping
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.320]   with the next woman, right?
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.480]   Then you start a pattern, and those patterns
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.880]   start to predict where you're gonna go in the future,
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.520]   so then that's gonna be what your future looks like,
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.000]   so instead of even starting that pattern,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.520]   and for me, I know I have addictive behaviors,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.800]   that's the other reason why I don't smoke,
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.160]   and I didn't drink, and didn't watch pornography,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.800]   and don't cheat on my wife,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.840]   is 'cause I know I have addictive behaviors,
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.720]   and I will naturally, our inclination
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.600]   is to satisfy our flesh by whatever means,
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.160]   and I will become addicted to whatever pattern I start,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.960]   so I just err on the side of not starting
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.560]   those patterns whatsoever, and then the other thing is,
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.040]   now, is like, I couldn't even imagine
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.640]   having that conversation with Nicodemus II, ever.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.440]   Like, there's nothing that, I don't even know
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.040]   how I would approach having to go to him and say,
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.640]   well, I cheated on your mom, this is why, da-da-da-da-da.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.720]   Like, I couldn't even bring myself
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.920]   to have that conversation with him,
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.880]   so that's a part of it now, too.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.720]   - 100%.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.960]   Do you think you just have to find a girl
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.920]   who would work for that specific marriage?
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.440]   'Cause for me, I know, with my career, what I'm doing,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.520]   I need a girl who's gonna hold it down at the crib,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.040]   who, when I do wanna have children, she's there for them,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.080]   and I'll go out and provide financially,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   and she can, I guess that's more traditional,
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.560]   and I feel like that's just kind of being lost.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.680]   What is your thoughts on that?
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.440]   - It comes down to managing expectations.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.240]   Like, and that's one of the things where,
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.840]   for you, that's one of the things
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.600]   that you've taught me quite a few things,
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.200]   but bro, one of the biggest things that you've taught me
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   is the ability to be unapologetically 100% authentic, right?
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.120]   So, anybody who enters a relationship with you,
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.560]   especially a relationship that's going to end in marriage,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.720]   like, you will have, at some point,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   communicated your beliefs and your expectations
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.560]   for that marriage.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.400]   - It'll make me to roll with it or not.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.920]   - Hands down, right?
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.240]   Like, you are unapologetically,
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.760]   you're you, and you're very strong
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.320]   in what you believe you're gonna say it,
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.360]   and it's like, this is who I am?
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.640]   Like, this is the type of woman I want to raise my kids?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.360]   If that's not you, then it's not you, straight up.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.720]   That's healthy, though.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.940]   That's healthy, and I think a lot of marriages
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.960]   and a lot of relationships fail
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   because you don't manage those expectations.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.580]   Like, you've taught me that, and you've helped me.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.920]   This is what I expect.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.720]   This is what my expectations are for marriage.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.840]   This is expectations for our morals and values.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.960]   This is where we believe.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.000]   Where do you stand on that?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.040]   How do you stand on that?
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.700]   It literally comes down to managing expectations,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.120]   because there might be somebody else who sits here
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   and is like, my wife can do X, Y, Z,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.080]   and I'll just sit back and, you know what I mean?
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.320]   'Cause there's guys who believe
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.440]   completely opposite of what you believe,
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.800]   and they're gonna go get married,
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.720]   and they're gonna marry the woman
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.120]   that you don't wanna marry,
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.340]   but they've managed those expectations.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.740]   You can't wait till you're married
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.640]   to have those conversations either.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   That's the one thing I appreciate about you.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.120]   Like, you might go on a date,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.700]   you might have those first night over pasta.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.880]   You might air it out night number one.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.580]   Bro, we've been at business dinners,
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.680]   we've been at every type of dinner, any type of event,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.860]   and I've seen you air it out
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.340]   to people that were just meeting at the table.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.080]   But that's, I mean, the manager side of me
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.140]   sometimes is like, oh, well, this business deal is over.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:44.120]   But you being my brother and my friend,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.060]   I respect that so much,
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.880]   because it's like, you set the expectation,
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.700]   and that's who you are, you know what I mean?
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.980]   So if you don't do that in a marriage,
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.420]   it's gonna fail, straight up.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.180]   You don't get five years down the line
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.620]   and then something pops up and you've already said, I do,
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.820]   and now you're trying to figure it out.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.620]   And you definitely can't wait till you have kids,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.100]   because then you're trying to mold this human being,
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.740]   and if you're trying to mold this human being
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.740]   into two separate types of values and core beliefs,
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.440]   that's when it gets difficult.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.280]   - I agree.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.820]   Sierra, have you and Christian had this conversation?
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.140]   - We're doing this book right now,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.380]   101 Questions to Ask Before You Get Engaged,
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.980]   and it talks about a lot of things.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.940]   - Are you gonna be okay with taking his last name,
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.100]   or is he gonna have to take--
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.900]   - Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.780]   (laughing)
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.140]   - All right, good.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.660]   All right, my last question for you, bro,
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.580]   is we've talked about peace, we've talked about identity,
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.000]   we've talked about purpose and all these things.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.180]   For you specifically, what do you believe
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.260]   to be your purpose on this earth?
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.260]   Do you believe you're fulfilling it as we speak,
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.100]   and what are your goals?
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.580]   - Yeah, no, I definitely think I'm fulfilling it
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.500]   as we speak.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.100]   That's a great question.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   It took me 30 plus years to figure out what my purpose was,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.940]   and it's interesting, from the day,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.700]   I almost still remember around the time or the season
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.820]   where I figured it out,
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.980]   and how things just continually started to improve
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.420]   from a mental standpoint, spiritual standpoint,
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.420]   just holistically, all the way around.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.500]   For me, my purpose is to help people
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.340]   walk from vision to value, right?
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.260]   So that's why I keep talking about identity,
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.540]   because I think that if you don't have a vision,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.020]   it's to help people discover their vision for their life,
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.500]   and then once you've gotten to the point
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.700]   to where you've discovered the vision for your life,
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.540]   help you to produce value,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.140]   the value that that vision or your purpose
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.100]   predestines you to produce.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.360]   And I think that there's two sides of value.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.680]   So there's the value that you produce for the marketplace
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.660]   or the industry that you're in,
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.900]   but then on the flip side is there's an exchange of value.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.700]   When I produce value, I receive value, right?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.340]   From the most simple terms,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.060]   if you're looking for a professional athlete,
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.460]   if I'm producing this value
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.380]   that comes in a form of performance
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.620]   for the National Basketball Association,
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.700]   in return, I'm gonna receive a contract
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.420]   that shows the value that I'm producing.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.220]   So for me, it's simply put,
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.420]   it's like helping people walk from vision to value, right?
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:18.860]   And along those steps, it takes discovery of who you are,
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.560]   it takes development,
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.740]   it takes finding a way to deliver that value
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.500]   to the right marketplace, to the right people,
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.900]   and then in return, receiving that value
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.540]   that you've delivered to the marketplace.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.220]   So that's where I function every single day.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.920]   - Well, man, I feel like you dropped a lot of knowledge
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.900]   for everybody to listen to and even for me.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.740]   So go get that book.
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.580]   What's the book called again?
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.580]   - Out of Order.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.500]   - Out of Order.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.380]   I've already started it and it's really good.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.980]   Something I'm definitely implementing in my own life.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.020]   So go cop that book, Out of Order,
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.500]   and I appreciate you being on the podcast.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.340]   - Likewise.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.340]   You gotta tell people about our situation
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.700]   in the weight room in college.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.540]   - Oh yeah, I was gonna,
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:08.420]   'cause me and him almost weren't friends
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.780]   'cause I almost had to put hands on him
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.300]   is what he's talking about.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.780]   This is all the way back.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.140]   You know, I weigh 230 now,
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.180]   but I probably was what, like 190 at Mizzou?
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.380]   And I almost whooped him because this is,
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.420]   I'm gonna tell it from my perspective,
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.620]   then you can tell it from your perspective.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.700]   - Please do.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.500]   - So I got hurt already, so you know what I mean?
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.620]   I'm, throughout the course of the season,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.460]   I'm, you know, doing my rehab,
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.180]   getting my extra weight room sessions in, this and that.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.580]   I hit Nick up before a game like,
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.820]   yo, let's get this extra lift in, whatever.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.580]   Meanwhile, these dudes in Mizzou, you know,
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.860]   I don't know about other schools,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   but in Mizzou, they were trying to make us go to class.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.340]   Now, I would finesse my way out of it.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.620]   I would, you know, go until the class checkers came
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.060]   and then I would dip.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.460]   But they had us trying to go to class, tutors.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.340]   People always ask me, like,
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.620]   did I get paid to go to Mizzou?
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.580]   I didn't get anything.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.020]   And they're still trying to make me go to class.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.100]   So they had me doing the most.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.340]   So I hit him like, yo, let's get this extra lift in
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.700]   before this game.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.780]   And meanwhile, I just got done with tutoring.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.100]   Like, my tutoring session went forever.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.700]   And so I showed up five minutes late to the lift
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.100]   and this dude is already like, he has an attitude.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.340]   Like, he's already putting up the equipment, whatever.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.140]   So I'm walking away, I'm like, bro, what are you doing?
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.020]   Like, I'm hot because I already was mad
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.860]   that I was at tutoring.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.300]   So I walk in the way, I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.260]   And then he like, says something crazy.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.820]   So we end up about to scrap, really.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.260]   Like, I forget like, how close we got,
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.900]   but I think like, I started talking crazy to you,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.980]   you started talking crazy to me.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.180]   And like, it was really about to like, go down.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.180]   Like, that's from my perspective.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.420]   - That's definitely not how it happened.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.540]   Okay, so the truth of it,
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.500]   'cause I was talking to C before we even started,
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.820]   I was like, I wonder if Michael is gonna go there
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.940]   and tell that story.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.700]   But yeah, so from my perspective, you did.
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.980]   Kudos to you, you hit me up and wanted to get an extra lift.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.420]   So obviously, I take the time to get there
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.780]   before you're there.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.700]   I set it up and all that.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.220]   I look at the clock, you're late.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.140]   So because you're late, lift is over.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.180]   It's donezo, just straight up.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.260]   So I start putting this stuff away.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.180]   When I start putting this stuff away,
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.580]   that's when you walk in the weight room
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.340]   and you're like, what's good or whatever.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.700]   I was like, no lift.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.860]   You're like, what do you mean?
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.220]   I was like, you're late.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.100]   And then that's when you, he started raising his voice.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.020]   You talk about, what are you doing?
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.100]   I'll never forget.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.860]   I remember that's how it started.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.140]   You were like, what are you doing?
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.580]   And then you just went in.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.180]   You started talking crazy, crazy.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.700]   Like, what are you doing?
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.580]   Bro, you tripping.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.780]   And I'm like, I'm young, obviously.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.020]   So I'm like, I'm not the one.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.940]   So I start going back.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.820]   You start getting louder.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.700]   And you're like, you got me messed up.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.780]   So then that's when I remember
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.900]   I closed the weight room doors.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.980]   'Cause that's when we got to, it was about to get hectic.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.820]   I closed the weight room doors and I was like,
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.980]   so how you want to handle this, right?
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:01.420]   I'm professional, yes.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.500]   But I'm like, okay, so how you want to handle this?
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.380]   You're like.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.660]   And we went on and on and on and on for a little bit.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.700]   And then, but bro, I always,
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.860]   it's funny when you tell that story
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.140]   because people are asking me like,
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.540]   how did you and Mike get to the point
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.020]   to where you guys have the relationship
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.580]   that you have and you have trust?
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.540]   I'm like, because, like, we've gone,
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.180]   there's nothing that we haven't gone through.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.820]   Like, we have confrontations with each other.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.500]   We push each other to be the best, point blank, period.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.140]   So that's why I know that I can trust him
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.340]   and he knows that I can trust,
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   we can trust each other.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.580]   So bro, with that, yeah, dude lost his mind that day.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.860]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.580]   You got me messed up.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.940]   Nah, I'm lifting.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.900]   You're trying to tell me what to do in my weight room.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.420]   - So what would have happened
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.980]   if we got to scrapping, you think?
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.460]   'Cause at that point, I was pretty strong.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.500]   - I would have dropped you.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.660]   (laughing)
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:51.500]   I would have dropped you.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.300]   - And you can ask her, see, when I get--
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.140]   - See, cut the camera.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.140]   You don't even, I would have dropped you.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.900]   - When I get mad, how strong do I get?
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.180]   - Oh, you get pretty strong.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.500]   (laughing)
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.660]   - I used to get bad.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.220]   - Yeah, but that doesn't mean that you,
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.540]   I mean, I'm sure, you know,
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.260]   we do the boxing and stuff in the off season,
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.620]   so I'm sure your hands are improved,
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.700]   but you would have got dropped.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.620]   - It's cool.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.980]   Nah, you are pretty broad.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.740]   - Well, we'll find your picture up here,
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.620]   and your size, your pressure point.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.340]   - I still have his before picture, too,
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.180]   that we took.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.020]   I'll send it to you.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:25.700]   - And let people decide who they think would have won.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.540]   - That's funny.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:27.380]   - Well, I appreciate you, bro.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.820]   - Nah, I appreciate you having me on, bro.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.660]   - Yes, sir.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.340]   (hip hop music)
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.140]   - I always just think about,
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:35.980]   like, when you get mad,
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.540]   and you try to throw me over the banister.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.380]   - I was young.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.780]   I was like, four, I was like--
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.620]   - You were not four,
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.140]   'cause we were in the second house, I think.
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:42.980]   - No, we were in the--
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.580]   - 'Cause the banister was at the house of Fishers.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.580]   - Dude tried to throw you over a banister?
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.820]   - Yes, we had a banister.
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:49.660]   - I was a young boy.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.500]   She had me so high.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.340]   - And then you go up the stairs,
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.540]   and the banister was in the hallway,
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.180]   hardwood floor down there.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.020]   - Ay, yo!
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.100]   - This guy walked in here on me,
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.660]   trying to lift me over the banister.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.500]   I was like, what the,
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.180]   I think it's 'cause I took his lightsaber or something.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.780]   I was freaking, I was so hot.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.100]   - Dude was heated.
