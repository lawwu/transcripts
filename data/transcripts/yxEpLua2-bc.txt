[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.720]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.880]   Today I'm here with my guy, my right-hand man, Nick Ademus,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.820]   my manager, my trainer, security, all that, all in one.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.920]   So I'm excited to have you on Curious Mike,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.380]   it's been a long time coming.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.840]   Yeah, so for those of you that don't know,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.120]   we met back in college when I went to Mizzou.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.300]   He was my strength coach at the time.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.060]   And we kind of developed a relationship over time there,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.480]   but nothing to what it's like now.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.800]   Kind of, what was your, from your perspective,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.480]   how was it when I committed to Mizzou,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.580]   when I came there and kind of walked through
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.560]   like what you remember from that time when I was in Mizzou?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680]   - Bro, that was a rollercoaster
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.280]   because that was our first year at Mizzou.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.040]   We had just got there, obviously, with Coach Martin.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.940]   There was a ton of excitement around the program.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.180]   And then all of a sudden we signed Michael Porter Jr.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.260]   We signed Jontay Porter.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.460]   We get Blake Harris in addition to the guys
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.120]   that we already had.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.460]   And automatically America was on notice.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.640]   It was like, oh my goodness,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060]   you have to watch out for Mizzou next season.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.980]   And then I just remember we go through that whole summer
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.460]   and I was really surprised at the work and the effort
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.960]   and all that that you guys put in.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800]   Like, 'cause as young guys, you see freshmen who come in
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880]   and some of them have a work ethic, some of them don't.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.840]   But you in particular, like you were serious from day one,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.360]   specifically in the weight room.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   It was like, what is it gonna take to get better?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.440]   You did everything that was required.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.100]   You didn't necessarily like the 6 a.m.s in the sand.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660]   - You did nothing like that.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.240]   - But yeah, and then you get to the,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.680]   everything's going well.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   And then I remember we get to that first game, right?
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.820]   And then it's just something was off.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.580]   And I remember you saying that you couldn't go.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.460]   And then we go through that whole situation, right?
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.880]   Where right before your first game of college basketball,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.100]   due to the injury, you couldn't play.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.980]   And then we have the ups and downs and ups and downs
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.740]   to trying to get you back out there on the court,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.660]   trying to get you ready for really the next level
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.520]   at that point.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   And then you had that desire to come back.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.140]   So you came back and played in the NCAA tournament game
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.520]   against Florida State, right?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.300]   I think it's who we played against.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.140]   Was it Georgia?
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.580]   - I came back against Georgia in the SEC tournament.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.260]   - Florida State in the NCAA tournament.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260]   So there were a lot of ups and downs in between,
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.500]   but through that whole process,
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.580]   you and I formed a really good relationship
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.180]   and we stayed in contact and kept working together
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.460]   after you left to go to the NBA.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.420]   And then, shoot, here we are now.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.140]   - Yeah, so going back to that time,
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.420]   you being a young strength coach,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.620]   you were like boys with a lot of the players, you know?
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.260]   What was, you tell me sometimes
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.700]   about how we would be going out,
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.480]   not you, but some of us would be going out,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.000]   but you would have a fake Snapchat,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   acting like you was a girl in the ad of the players
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.700]   to see what we were on.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.980]   Explain your motive behind that.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.980]   - Yeah, so I mean, you just have to get,
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.720]   I had to get creative, right?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.340]   Because I think part of my responsibility
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.080]   as the strength and conditioning coach at that time
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.860]   was just to make sure that you guys were putting yourselves
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.300]   in position to be successful,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.220]   to be your eyes and ears for things
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.520]   that you might not know that could happen,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.680]   that are happening out in the world,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.260]   and just be as protective or as helpful as I can.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.820]   And a part of that was understanding
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.220]   how you guys were moving around
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.420]   on the streets in the weekend.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.420]   So whether it was having a burner account on Snap,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.920]   or having a burner account on IG,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.880]   or even, you know, there are times
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.580]   where befriending you all's significant others, right?
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.680]   And you're saying, "Coach Nick,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.760]   I can't believe Michael would do this,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.780]   or I can't believe Blake would do this,
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.560]   and this and that, and this and that."
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.340]   You know, it was by any means necessary
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.200]   just keeping an eye and an ear to the streets
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.620]   and figuring out how y'all were moving on the weekends
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.720]   and during the week.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.700]   - Yeah, that's funny, that's hilarious to talk about.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.060]   So yeah, you have a very,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.100]   I'd say like a protective nature
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.380]   about your protective personality.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.380]   One story in particular that I think is interesting
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.480]   is the story about your younger sister.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.300]   And you told me one time about how your younger sister,
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.780]   she was, I think it was her roommate's boyfriend
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.060]   or something, and her roommate's boyfriend
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.620]   like disrespected your sister.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.700]   And you said you and your brother
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.160]   flew all the way to, I think-
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.780]   - West Lafayette, Indiana.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.720]   - Oh yeah, Indiana to check him.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.820]   What was that story?
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.940]   What happened there?
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.980]   Have you always kind of had a protective nature?
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.260]   Was that just something you grew up with or what?
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.340]   - Yeah, I mean, early on, it comes from our father.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.340]   I'm one of seven, I have an older brother,
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.680]   and then I have five sisters.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.980]   And I mean, we came from very humble beginnings.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.900]   My pops moved around in the streets.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.820]   So he taught us some of those lessons
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.900]   and some of the things that were necessary for us
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.340]   to survive in the streets and to protect our sisters
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.140]   and protect our mom was the number one priority.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.620]   Even from a young age, I can remember me and G, Gary,
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.980]   my older brother were very, very young.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.340]   And my dad would always say, "When he's gone,
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.340]   my brother's the man of the house."
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.180]   And then it's my job to help my brother
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.780]   being the man of the house, protect my mom and my sisters.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.940]   So from a young age, pops ingrained that in us
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.140]   over and over and over.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.980]   So, I mean, when we didn't know what else to do,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.700]   we knew that our responsibility was always to protect
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.620]   our mom and our sisters.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.740]   And that was just an instance where my little sister,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.100]   she was in college.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   And I remember getting that phone call.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.620]   She called my brother and I, and she was crying.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.820]   And then she started going off.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.460]   My sister's very independent.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.300]   So if she's to the point to where she's crying,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.740]   you know something's going down.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.500]   I guess she had a confrontation with a roommate's boyfriend.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.780]   A roommate's boyfriend has some choice words.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.900]   So my brother and I already knew what it was.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.060]   - Nah, we needed some service.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.180]   - Yeah, so I mean, it was essentially a situation
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.820]   where we hopped on a plane, went to West Lafayette.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.320]   There was a confrontation.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.660]   - Oh, with him directly?
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.500]   - Yeah.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.340]   - Oh, really?
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.980]   And then post confrontation, all of his things were packed
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.540]   up in black trash bags and put on the street corner.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.020]   And that was the last time they had communication with him.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.140]   One of those types of situations.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.740]   - I like it, I like it.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.220]   Nah, I can't think of any times I've really had to,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.180]   both my sisters are older, but I can't remember any times
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.340]   me and my brothers have had to,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.500]   but we'd be on the same type of time for sure.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.340]   - I'm switching gears a little bit.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   I wanna get into this book that you recently wrote.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.940]   So you wrote a book.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.300]   First of all, what was your motivation
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.360]   behind writing the book and what is it about?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   - Yeah, so it was, shoot, over the last 14, 15 years,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.800]   working with collegiate athletes,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.300]   working with professional athletes,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.020]   working with businessmen and business women.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.820]   You see people who reach this pinnacle of success
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.340]   of what we define as success, but behind the scenes,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.640]   they still, for some reason, are never able to find peace.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   So like that concept just, I almost became obsessed with it.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.540]   So I challenged myself.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.060]   I was like, for the next year, every single day,
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.620]   I had to spend an hour a day studying peace
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.500]   to really figure out what it was, how do you find it?
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.660]   How do you help people achieve it?
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.620]   And then I ended up, it was over a year straight,
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.860]   over a year, 365 days straight,
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.420]   where I studied peace and it kept going.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.020]   But through that study, I came to realize that order,
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.820]   the word order, order was a prerequisite to peace.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.060]   So when people are able to find order in their lives,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.900]   then that sets them up to have peace, right?
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.020]   And that word peace, if you look at it,
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.540]   if you look at the etymology of it,
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.860]   it's so rich in meaning.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.380]   It means wholeness, it means health, it means prosperity,
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.980]   which means to move forward.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.960]   It means protection, it means completion.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   So when you have order in your life,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.300]   you set yourself up to have a healthier life,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.380]   to have a more prosperous life, to have all these things.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.340]   So it was just through my studies,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.320]   through experience in life with guys like you
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.620]   and seeing the struggle to find peace
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.380]   and finding out that order was a prerequisite,
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.740]   I was like, yo, like this is something
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.840]   that I want to share with others,
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.240]   specifically people who are in your situation.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.340]   So I knew from the beginning,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.140]   it wasn't gonna be a traditional book,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.140]   but I've been practicing journaling for over 10 years now.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.200]   And then it clicked.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.060]   It was like, well, I believe in the con,
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.340]   there's this concept called instinctive elaboration,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.180]   where if you ask a questions,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.580]   questions for even a quick second, hijack the brain,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.860]   and you have an opportunity to be introspective
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.920]   and to just practice self-examination.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.080]   So the way that I decided to do it
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.080]   is to ask a series of 17 very introspective questions
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   to where you have to look yourself in the mirror.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.980]   And the hope is that as you find your identity
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.620]   over the course of answering those seven questions
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.380]   and start to establish order in your life,
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.140]   then that's where you can really start to walk in the peace
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.900]   that we should all be walking in.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.860]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.860]   - So peace, identity, all these words that you're using,
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.260]   I feel like are words that are super important
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.920]   to a person of faith, a person of God.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.860]   I feel like people that kind of are in the world
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.360]   trying to do what the world's doing,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.100]   their goals would be more happiness
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.240]   or their goals would be more pleasure,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.340]   but you use the word peace.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.580]   So how would you say peace differs from happiness?
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.700]   'Cause you said you found
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.420]   that even some of the most successful people,
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.900]   they were lacking in peace,
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.060]   which is something I've seen too.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.620]   Some of the most happiest people,
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.840]   most famous people, most rich people,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.780]   peace is the thing that they're lacking,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.000]   but it's also the thing that they don't know how to find.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.060]   So how would you say peace differs from happiness?
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.200]   - Well, I would say that obviously happiness is an emotion.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.080]   One of the words that pops in my mind
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.060]   that's synonymous with peace, if you look at the,
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.900]   like I said, the etymology of that word peace
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.960]   is fulfillment, right?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.180]   You see people all the time who are quote unquote
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.500]   at this pinnacle of success,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.160]   and then they're depressed or they're committing suicide
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.060]   or they're lacking fulfillment.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.000]   That word peace to be complete, to be whole,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   fulfillment is something that eludes so many people.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.500]   So whether you wanna think of it as the word peace
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.380]   or even wellness or fulfillment,
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.140]   I think all of us were placed on this earth
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.340]   to fulfill something.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.360]   And that's why I use the word identity,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.540]   because you have to know who you are
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.020]   and what your identity is and what you were placed here
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.680]   to do in order to fulfill that.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.780]   So you can make a billion dollars,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.220]   but not be doing the thing that you were created to do
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.700]   and you don't have fulfillment.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.040]   You can be the best CEO, but at home,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.420]   your life is in turmoil, right?
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.900]   Because you focus so much on the professional accolades
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.900]   that you forgot that you had a wife and kids at home.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.480]   It's interesting you asked that question.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.880]   I saw a quote the other day.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.660]   It said that in 20 years from now,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.820]   the only person or the only people that are gonna remember
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.840]   that you worked overtime are your kids.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.480]   And that hit me differently, right?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.560]   Because you see, I see it all the time.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.200]   These people who grind, grind, grind, grind, grind,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.760]   they work, work, work, and they find something.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.520]   What I think they do is they reach an achievement.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's not success because success can't just be external.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.280]   It can't just be money.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.600]   There's two parts to success.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   There's the internal part and the external part.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.120]   So yes, there's the joy and the happiness and all that,
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.640]   but you don't wanna have that and be broke.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.400]   So I think that that's why I love the word fulfillment
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.080]   is because it's I'm having professional success,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.580]   but I'm also having personal success, relational success,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.900]   psychological success.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.600]   So it's like the whole complete picture coming together.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.120]   - From my experience, and I don't know what you think,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.400]   peace is something that, like it talks in the Bible about,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.120]   you know, it's something you search for,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.420]   but then it's something that you work to keep.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.680]   Like you work to maintain peace.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.840]   So it's something that can come and go.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.680]   What are the main ways, I mean, you talk about order,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.500]   but what are the practical ways you think
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.000]   that you can maintain peace?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.120]   Do you think it's the routine, it's the habits,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.240]   or it's waking you up early?
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.960]   What do you think if you had to give a few practical ways
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.080]   where you can maintain peace,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.000]   regardless of the ups and downs of life?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.600]   - Number one, find your identity.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.360]   I think that everything that is set apart
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.380]   or set aside for you is in your identity,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.260]   because when you find out who you are,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.200]   then you'll find out why you're here.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.880]   And then that's where you start to prioritize your time
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   and your effort towards that.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.900]   All right, so I think identity is finding your identity
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.080]   is so important.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.160]   I think we're suffering from an identity crisis
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.820]   in the world because everybody is putting on
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.300]   these false identities, especially guys like you.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.000]   You have fans telling you,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.240]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.400]   You have friends telling you,
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.520]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.480]   You have an organization telling you,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.580]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.560]   You have a family telling you,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.380]   this is who you're supposed to be.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.840]   But it's like, at what point do you actually find
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.680]   that identity?
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   Me being a believer,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.800]   I believe that we get our identity from God.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   I believe in this concept of original intent,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.600]   where it's like, he originally intended for us
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.440]   to be something, to do something,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.120]   to expand his kingdom on earth.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.640]   So I think that everything starts
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   with finding the right identity.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.280]   I think the second thing is making sure
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.880]   that you have the right influences around you,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.400]   because who you're with and who you're around
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.820]   will significantly impact the decisions you make.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.160]   Interesting thing about that was watch,
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.720]   I had a conversation probably about a year ago
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.560]   with a guy by the name of Moran Cerf.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.840]   He's a Dr. Moran Cerf.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.080]   He's a world renowned neuroscientist.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.220]   I was actually listening to the playback
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.080]   of our conversation this morning.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.000]   And one of the things that he talked about,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.800]   his big thing is human behavior
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.640]   and changing human behavior.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.220]   And he said that one of the biggest things
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.960]   that you can do to impact human behavior
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   is this concept of proximity, right?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.200]   He said that the brain actually has the ability
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.160]   to learn through osmosis.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.920]   So the example he gave me, he was like,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.760]   if you wanna be a better comedian,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.120]   you can go read a book about a thousand jokes,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.960]   or you can go spend time with a comedian.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.720]   And if you go spend time with a comedian,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.840]   because you're in proximity to them,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.660]   you'll learn how to be a comedian.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.460]   So I think identity, I think influence,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.940]   I think instructions are big.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.120]   So instructions for me are just like those habits
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.100]   and those principles and those things
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.260]   that we live by that guide us.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.520]   You know me, I'm big on habits, I'm big on discipline.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.420]   So I think that making sure that you're following
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.340]   some type of principles
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.180]   and you're willing to stick to those principles,
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.660]   I think that those things lead to peace.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.780]   And then there's a scripture in the Bible
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.620]   that also says wisdom's paths are peace.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.940]   So when you practice wisdom, then that path leads to peace.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.820]   So I think that it's important
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.260]   that you're following the right instructions
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.300]   and your principles and you're applying those principles.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.060]   And when you apply them, you'll have peace.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.060]   So identity, influence, and instructions.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.100]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in my life
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.640]   when I've applied those things,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.200]   sometimes better, sometimes worse,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.820]   but when I'm doing them consistently,
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.820]   that's when I have most peace,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.140]   regardless of the good games, the bad games.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.460]   But like you said, I feel like our culture
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.380]   and a lot of young people, it's an identity crisis.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.380]   I feel like even the people that are doing these things,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.820]   maybe they are using Instagram
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.700]   and that's their whole job or whatever.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.940]   I just feel like there's a lot of people
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.500]   that are doing things in life right now
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.680]   that don't align with their purpose.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.940]   Like you said, you believe everyone was put on here
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.760]   for a purpose.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.040]   So how do you think you find your purpose?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.500]   For me, I mean, I've always been told like you evaluate
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.320]   kind of your skillset, what you're good at.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.880]   And then at the end of the day, like if you're a believer,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.320]   you believe that the main thing is to push the kingdom,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.760]   draw more people to God, but how do you think?
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   'Cause I just know, man, there's a lot of young people.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.820]   I got a lot of friends who, even me,
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.460]   I don't know if I didn't make it in basketball
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.440]   or like for some reason, if one of those injuries
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.480]   was career ending, like I don't know
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.320]   where I would have gone from there.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.960]   I don't know how I would have used.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.440]   'Cause I always felt like my gift was basketball.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.560]   So even talking to the people who felt,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.600]   or they grew up doing one thing
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.480]   and then they didn't make it to where they wanted to.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.960]   Now they're having to shift their whole life.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.280]   Like how do you find your purpose?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.160]   Because I just feel like, man,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.080]   a lot of people are walking around here
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.420]   doing things they don't wanna do.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.320]   They have jobs they don't wanna have.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.720]   And I mean, that's a depressing thought.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.440]   I'm glad basketball worked out for me,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.880]   but it could have easily not.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.960]   - So how do you find your, what's your place on earth for?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.800]   - Yeah, you know, so that reminds me of a,
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.060]   I was watching an interview.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.260]   This is probably some years ago.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.240]   And it was Virgil Abloh, who before his passing,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.500]   he was at one of the Ivy League schools
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.600]   and he was doing an interview.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.040]   And somehow they got on the topic of purpose.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.280]   And he had said it so clearly in a way that stuck with me.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.640]   And he said, find your through line.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.700]   So what essentially your through line is,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.080]   is you look over the course of your life
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.900]   and there's this string of something
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.460]   that you just couldn't shake, right?
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.240]   And in looking at that through line, you'll find purpose.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.960]   And the thing that I added to that,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.480]   that I started to realize is,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.680]   oftentimes we get mad at the frustrations that we have,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.440]   but I think your unique frustrations
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.880]   are a clue as to what your purpose is.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   Like for me, for example, I can't,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.520]   the thing that keeps me up at night
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.880]   is when I see need or when I see somebody
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.400]   who is suffering from some type of disorder or dysfunction
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.760]   or has chaos in their life.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.560]   So I, from a young age, my mom will tell you,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.580]   like I always had a heart for the homeless people
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.920]   or people who were dealing with some type of dysfunction.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.500]   So over the whole course of my life,
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.120]   need has bothered me
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.240]   or disorder and dysfunction has bothered me.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.280]   So I think you look at your unique frustrations,
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.080]   obviously your unique abilities.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.200]   Like there's something that you can do
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.280]   that surpasses the average skill level, right?
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.540]   You have a unique ability to do something.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.400]   I think there's, I heard a acronym before
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.760]   for finding your purpose, it's called SHAPE.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.520]   So you look at your spiritual gifts, right?
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.920]   You look at your heart, the unique passions that you have.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.400]   You look at your unique abilities and your attitudes.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.160]   P stands for personality.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.060]   I think that each of us have some unique aspects
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.900]   to our personality that make us who we are.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.100]   If I'm giving an example for myself, very introverted,
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.660]   prefer to be behind the camera,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.400]   behind the scenes and all that.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.100]   Why is that important for my purpose?
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.960]   Is because it was my introvertedness that pushed me
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.500]   to be okay with, instead of moving around this way
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.540]   or that way, just be at the crib studying, right?
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.400]   And soaking in this information
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.120]   and learning how to apply this information
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.340]   so that I can help young guys like you.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.540]   So I think that, and then E is experiences.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.420]   So you look at the unique experiences
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.460]   that you've had over the course of your life.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.580]   And if you look at all those, your personality,
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.580]   unique abilities, unique frustrations, unique experiences,
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.640]   and even educationally, the things
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.880]   that you just have a knack for doing.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.740]   If you look at all those, those are all clues
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.080]   that point towards why you're here.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.260]   And I think most importantly is,
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   with regards to the identity crisis,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.000]   is you have to connect to the right source.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.020]   That's why, for me, my belief is so important
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.340]   because I can't get my identity from the outside world.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.240]   I can't get my identity from social media.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.380]   I can't get my identity from popular culture.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   I can't get my identity from anything else
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.400]   because it's a flawed identity.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   - 100%.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.300]   So I think one thing that,
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.500]   this is just a random thing I came up with
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.560]   as we're talking about peace.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.220]   One thing I always struggle with,
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.020]   with people who claim to be Christians,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.460]   is I feel like Christians are sometimes
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.700]   some of the people that lack the most peace.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.500]   And I look at other religious people around the world
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   or some of these people practicing this new age spirituality
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.680]   or the people that, even sometimes atheists,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.520]   and I look at them and I'm like,
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.340]   man, they're more, sometimes,
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.580]   appear to be more peaceful than Christians.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.520]   And I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   I think it might be because of the,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.500]   when you do accept God and you accept Christ into your life,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.860]   there will be a pull.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.060]   It'll be the spirit versus the flesh.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.060]   And you kinda gotta pick one.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.480]   That's why it says if you're a lukewarm Christian,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.800]   that's the most miserable place to be
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.260]   because you'll be lacking so much peace
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.660]   because you're getting pulled in two different directions.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.640]   So I think in our world now today,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   I feel like part of the reason Christians in general
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.760]   lack so much peace is they're lukewarm.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.580]   They never, they don't, and I'm talking to myself as well,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.920]   they didn't go fully in committing to God and his ways
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.880]   and his principles and what the Bible says is right.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.180]   But they also don't feel comfortable
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.440]   doing all the stuff the world says is okay.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.920]   And so they lack so much peace.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.480]   And I just feel like that's a place
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.800]   that a lot of people are in the world today.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.760]   What is your perspective on Christian people lacking peace?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   Do you think it's 'cause of the lukewarmness
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.920]   or where do you think that comes from?
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.440]   - I think that reminds me of a quote my dad gave me.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.360]   He told me, he told us early on,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.160]   he said your religion will take you to hell.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.840]   So he taught us early on that obviously we are Christians
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.960]   and that's our faith,
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.280]   but he told us the most important thing
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.660]   is your relationship with God.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.480]   Because we know whether it's a physical relationship
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.960]   or whatever type of relationship we wanna apply it to,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.040]   as you grow in that relationship
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.200]   and you start to become more intimate
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.160]   and you start to find new revelations
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.720]   of this and that and this and that,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.860]   then there is a certain level of peace that comes with that.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.360]   There's a certain level specifically
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.540]   with our relationship with God
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.360]   is as we start to submit to him and his plan and his purpose
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.520]   and actually spend time with him,
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   then he starts to reveal certain things to us.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.360]   I think when you start to talk about religion,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.260]   religion is just, for some people it's just a habit.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.440]   It's like I go to church, I sing a couple of worship songs,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.360]   I pray before I eat,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.400]   but there's no real execution on the principles.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.560]   So it goes back to when I talked about
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   following the right instructions, like it's okay.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.000]   It's one thing to read the scripture
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.680]   and it's another thing to actually apply the principles
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.000]   that are in the scripture.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.680]   And I think you and I have talked about this
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.240]   a million times, like sometimes,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.340]   now that I'm in the position that I'm in
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.360]   and we'll be sitting in meetings
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.780]   and this and that and this and that.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.340]   So I think sometimes I've seen businessmen
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.200]   and businesswoman CEOs who apply biblical principles
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.920]   better than Christians do.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.820]   - Right. - Right?
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.260]   It's the application of the principle.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.960]   So it's one thing to go to church
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.620]   and it's one thing to receive the gift of salvation,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.840]   but there's a whole nother thing
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.080]   about walking this thing out daily
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.280]   and applying the principles.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.680]   Because principles are important.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.760]   There's a, the way that Dr. Miles Monroe,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.600]   I'll never forget it.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.400]   He said, "Every principle has an if-then clause."
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.320]   So if I do this, then this happens.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.500]   The business world applies those principles
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.140]   because they know if, for example,
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.140]   if I keep my balance sheet in order, then X, Y, Z happens.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.540]   But in Christianity,
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.460]   we don't necessarily follow those principles
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.140]   or execute on them.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.020]   - I agree.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.820]   Talk a little bit about a morning routine
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.220]   on the more practical side again,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.620]   because I feel like as important as all these topics are,
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.780]   like sometimes people that are super busy
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.500]   or make themselves too busy,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.300]   it's very hard to get to the place
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.580]   where you're applying the things
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.300]   that you need to in order to live the life you want to live.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.260]   Like there is a practical side of,
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.020]   I need to spend time in the Word.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.660]   I need to fill myself up.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.780]   I need to have this time to journal.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.460]   So I think personally, from my experience,
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.520]   the morning time is so good.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.740]   I heard a quote one time,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.340]   "You don't tune the instrument after the concert.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.580]   You tune it before."
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.020]   So, you know, that's first thing in the morning.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.860]   You make sure you're in the right head space
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.580]   to go be the person you want to be,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.500]   go make the decisions you want to make.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.140]   And I know you're big on a morning routine.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.500]   So just for the people that are listening,
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.260]   that they want to change their life
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.180]   and they want to be more disciplined and install new habits.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.440]   How important is a morning routine
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.700]   and kind of walk through yours?
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.720]   - Yeah, for me, it's extremely important
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.500]   because I heard a quote before.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.380]   You can't be serious about life
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.980]   and serious about purpose and practice apathy
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.780]   in most areas of your life.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.860]   So in order to be serious about life
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.180]   and actively transform your life and change your life,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.020]   it requires intentionality.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.640]   You have to be intentional in every area of your life.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.560]   So what that looks like for me
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.140]   is I just made a decision early on.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.780]   I can't just let the day happen to me.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.660]   And the way that I put it is I have to create the day.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.700]   Like that's my goal every single day is to create the day.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.980]   Don't let the day happen to me.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.180]   And what that looks like,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.700]   what that looks like is taking control of my day.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.860]   So it might look like waking up at 5 a.m., right?
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.880]   So like I joke about it all the time,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.780]   but I know you're gonna wake,
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.500]   you usually wake up around 8, 8.30.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.100]   My Nicodemus, Nicodemus usually wakes up about 7, 7.30.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.780]   So I know I need to get everything done before then
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.700]   so that I can be completely available for Nicodemus,
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.220]   be completely available for you
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.540]   and completely available for any other thing
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.600]   that I need to take care of that day.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.660]   So that requires me to wake up first thing
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.540]   in the morning.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.560]   What I do is now I go get in a cold plunge.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.100]   So first things first,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.120]   wake up, go straight to the cold plunge, three minutes, right?
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.980]   That's gonna do a million different things,
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.820]   but the biggest thing for me strengthens my immune system,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.200]   helps with mental clarity first thing in the morning,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.100]   resets my circadian rhythm,
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.740]   so that I get better sleep at night.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.520]   So I start there, it wakes me up,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.940]   and then I'll do red light therapy for about 10 minutes.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.960]   But I'm big on stacking habits
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.620]   because there's a million habits that you can practice.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.860]   But for me, it's like, which ones can I stack?
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.400]   So while I'm doing 10 minutes of red light therapy,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.780]   I'll either play worship music and worship,
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.960]   or that's my 10 minutes of uninterrupted prayer.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.020]   Because I think in order for me to maintain my identity,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.300]   I have to connect to my source, right?
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.600]   So just like we wouldn't go on a road trip
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.780]   and leave our charger at home,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.420]   I have to get charged up first thing every morning.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.360]   You and I have talked about that from a discipline standpoint.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.320]   Sometimes you ask me, how do you stay so disciplined
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.720]   and not do this and not do that?
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.640]   And I tell you, I'm just like everybody else.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.800]   I just make sure that I connect to the source
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.880]   first thing in the morning
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.760]   so that I have the right perspective
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.120]   and I know I need to get connected to the source.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.640]   So it's one day to the next.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.420]   So cold plunge, red light therapy with prayer and worship,
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.840]   and then start knocking off stuff off my to-do list.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   And then once Nicodemus wakes up,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.620]   then that's usually like from seven to,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.380]   I drop him off at daycare around 8.30.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.620]   That is my, I'm completely for the most part unavailable.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.180]   Like that's his time.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.780]   So we'll make breakfast together.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.120]   We'll sit, like he knows already.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.260]   He'll, we'll watch worship.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.340]   So we'll listen to one worship song
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.440]   and then we'll do one educational activity.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.420]   Like for him right now, he's learning Spanish.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.720]   So we'll watch like 30 minutes of Spanish while he's eating,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.440]   but we'll make breakfast together.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.420]   And then after that, throughout the day,
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.320]   I set aside time for working out
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.000]   and professional development and all that.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   But that morning routine of getting the cold,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.120]   red light therapy, prayer and worship,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.960]   and then sunlight exposure.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.520]   So then I walk out before he wakes up,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.240]   if the sun is out, 10 minutes in the sun,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.980]   and that's my time of gratitude.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.300]   So I've knocked out mind, body and spirit together.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.940]   And it takes about 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.820]   And that's how I start my day.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.740]   - That's amazing.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.520]   I like what you said about connecting to the power source
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.380]   as well, because it's such a biblical principle
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.500]   of God gives you enough, like for the day.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.460]   Like you can do that routine for a year straight.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.640]   And then if you took three or four days off,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.820]   you wouldn't feel right.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.420]   Because, or like even talking about like getting in the word
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.340]   or your prayer time, you can pray for three days in a row,
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.320]   but that's not going to last you for that fourth day.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.320]   It's like a daily, in the Bible, you know,
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.680]   God gave them enough manna for one day
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.660]   and then it would go rotten.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.260]   They would have to go recollect it the next day.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.300]   I forget which guy it was,
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.480]   but he would go into prayer three times a day
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.020]   to reconnect, to refill himself up.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.300]   So it's not like, it's a daily walk and it's a daily habit.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.500]   And sometimes for me, and I think a lot of other people,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.660]   it's like, you know, you might be doing so good
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.800]   in how you want to be and what you want to do
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.880]   for a week straight,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.760]   but it's like a cycle.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   You go through these ups and downs of you do good,
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.040]   then you don't do good.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.080]   Then you crawl out of it and you do good,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.920]   then you don't do good.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.020]   And I think that's, that's that chaos in your life.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.220]   If you can create the, like the order,
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.420]   then you'll see like the consistency
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.000]   and who you want to be.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.860]   And I just think that I've seen it so much in my life
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.280]   because I hate the cycle.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.020]   Cause I feel like a lot of people feel helpless
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.740]   when they're doing good
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.380]   or they're being who they want to be for a couple of weeks.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.500]   And then man, they have a bad three or four days
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.740]   and then they start binging on something for a few days
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.940]   and they crawl out of it.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.740]   That's like the worst place to be in.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.580]   - It's hard.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.000]   The, the, another, another part of that word order
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.940]   from the etymology of it is prioritization.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.660]   And that's why I do that.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.580]   It's I do the first things first.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.700]   Journaling is a part of my morning routine,
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.380]   obviously as well.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.240]   And I know you're big on journaling,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.700]   but it's like, I have to do the first things first.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.820]   I have to set something as a priority
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.700]   and then everything else falls in line.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.420]   So for me, like I said, it's connecting to God,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.660]   it's spending time in worship,
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.540]   it's spending time with Nicodemus,
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.100]   it's spending time making sure that I'm taking care
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.980]   of myself so that I can provide the best,
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.180]   whatever it is to the world.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.300]   And then along the lines of what you say,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.340]   what you said, like from a biblical perspective,
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.060]   one of the most profound things I have had ever seen
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.320]   in the scripture is that like when Jesus started
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.220]   his ministry, we see the story of him being baptized
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.100]   by John the Baptist, and that represents him
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.660]   beginning his ministry.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.380]   And then that story goes, there's a dove that comes down
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.120]   from heaven and God says, this is my son
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.780]   in whom I'm well pleased.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.380]   So that stuck with me because I realized that before Jesus
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.980]   took the steps to walk in his ministry,
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.140]   he received affirmation from the father.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.220]   And I just took that for me that if I receive affirmation
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.880]   from God, I never have to function for affirmation
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.580]   from others, period.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.340]   So it's either we're functioning from a place of affirmation
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.940]   or you're functioning for affirmation.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.260]   And that's super hard for y'all.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.540]   - Which is our whole life.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.380]   - Everything.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.700]   - Our whole life because you just have so much criticism,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.100]   you have so much, you know, nitpicking on how you played.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.940]   - All of it.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.220]   - But everything, I mean, if you're on social media,
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.380]   if you're posting pictures, what is that really for?
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.120]   That's usually for affirmation.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:37.960]   - For sure.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.580]   - I've seen 99% of people or maybe probably higher
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.140]   live from a place of affirmation.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.420]   That's such an unstable place because it's like, man,
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.420]   you're at the mercy of other people.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.900]   If you're an athlete, it's the worst.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.860]   You got these young dudes, one of my good friends,
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.360]   retiring at such a young age because they feel
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.600]   that pressure and they feel that anxiety
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.220]   because they're getting their worth.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   And I feel like that only comes because they're trying,
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.340]   they're playing for affirmation.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.940]   They're getting their worth from basketball.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.380]   I mean, every athlete struggles with it
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.760]   'cause it's such high stakes.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.180]   It feels like the world's on your shoulders sometimes.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.740]   You know, so many people watch the games,
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.840]   but yeah, for guys in our position,
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   that would be a game changer.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.020]   And then it lets you play more free, you know.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.740]   It lets you, you know, you're not playing
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.280]   to get the applause from the fans,
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.720]   to get the people commenting on your pictures
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.580]   after your game on Instagram.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.140]   You're just hooping 'cause you want to hoop
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.820]   and you know that's a gift God gave you.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.260]   And that frees you up to then play better, you know what I mean?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.480]   And it gives you a focus for your performance, right?
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.920]   So it's like, I'm not performing for your applause.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.240]   I'm not performing for your cheers
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.820]   'cause I've already been affirmed from the Father.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.100]   And the way that that looks like,
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.860]   I always try to take biblical principles
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.820]   and make it practical.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.180]   The way that I practice it with Nicodemus,
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.920]   he's only three years old.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.180]   And before, like every day we'll do one activity
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.000]   when he gets home.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.220]   Right now, it's basketball or soccer.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.900]   So before we even start the activity,
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.680]   I tell him I love him and I'm proud of you.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.980]   I was like, you know, Dad loves you.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.880]   You know, I'm proud of you, right?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.100]   So I never, so he never has to come to me
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.660]   and ask me if I'm proud of him
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.600]   because of how well he played.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.240]   So I always, and I told myself,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.140]   like I have this list in my phone
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   of things that I have to do.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.340]   And that's one of the things.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.500]   I always affirm him before the activity,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.140]   even if it's a learning activity,
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.060]   'cause he's at the age now where he's like,
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.700]   "Dad, Dad, are you proud of me?"
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.580]   And I'll remind him.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.160]   I said, "Son, I was proud of you before we even started.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.760]   "Remember, Dad, I told you he loved you.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.760]   "I told you I was proud of you.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.160]   "So now, 'cause he's three and he's already,
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.220]   "are you proud of me?
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.140]   "Dad, Dad, give me a high five.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.700]   "I told you that before we started.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.640]   "So you don't ever have to perform for that
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.380]   "'cause you've already been affirmed before."
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.160]   - Right, that's cool.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.160]   One thing I wanna touch on
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.580]   that I think is really unique about you
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.980]   is because you are, and one of the reasons
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.020]   that I wanted you in my life
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.300]   is because I felt like I always kind of lacked,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.420]   and I'm disciplined in certain areas.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.120]   I'm disciplined in the weight room and on the court,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.740]   things like that, but I'm undisciplined
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.580]   and I'm very unintentional in other areas,
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.860]   and I saw that in you.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.280]   So you've been like this for a long time,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.460]   one of the most disciplined people, very habit-oriented.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.620]   You have never had a sip of alcohol
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.820]   and you've never smoked or any of that in your life.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   Where did that come from and how do you keep that up?
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.660]   I think you even said you've never even seen pornography
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.660]   before, like how did, yeah, how is that possible?
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.620]   - Well, younger years, it was a promise
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.580]   that I made to my mom, right?
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.140]   And then you get older, you get past the adolescence
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   and you have a decision on your own.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.620]   - But talk about, I mean, you were in a frat.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.520]   They have the initiation and stuff like that.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.400]   How did you stay strong in all of these convictions
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.220]   that you had and yeah?
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:02.100]   - Bro, it's crazy that I don't, I don't know.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.980]   I think it's always been, from a young age,
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:13.360]   my never wanting to disappoint God and my parents.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.260]   And you know me now, like that might be
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.740]   one of my greatest weaknesses
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.540]   is I don't like disappointing people, right?
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.740]   So it's like you'll sacrifice everything for others
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.220]   just so that you don't disappoint them.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   And then sometimes you can end up losing yourself.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.200]   That's a whole nother story, but it was,
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.580]   I never wanted to disappoint my parents.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.560]   I never wanted to disappoint God.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.460]   I remembered how hard life was early on
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.020]   and I never wanted to go back to that.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:54.020]   And I just associated things like drinking, smoking,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.100]   getting caught up in this and that and this and that
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.600]   as not leading me in the right direction, right?
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.000]   Because for me, I think discipline is simply like
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.620]   knowing what to say yes to and what to say no to.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.360]   So I always, I just made a decision early on.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.620]   Like I was gonna say yes to, like I knew that
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.740]   I was created to do something special.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.420]   I didn't know what it was, but I'd always asked myself,
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.760]   like, is this gonna get me closer to whatever it is
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.020]   that I'm supposed to do?
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.640]   Or is it gonna get me further away?
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.460]   It wasn't hard being in a fraternity,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.060]   being a part of Phi Beta Sigma
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.820]   on the campus of Baylor University.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.640]   Like it wasn't, it's not easy, but I did it.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.260]   I was fortunate though,
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.640]   and that my closest circle of friends to this day,
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.880]   Curtis Oparra and Nathaniel Higgins, my brother Gary,
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.500]   for a little while, I had some very, very close friends
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.520]   who they all accepted me for who I was though too.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.480]   They were always like, Nicodemus doesn't do that.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.320]   That's not what he does.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.740]   And they let me be me.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.640]   I think I told you that.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.820]   And I realized early on how important
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.120]   having the right people in your ecosystem is
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.180]   because they never, it was easy because obviously
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.860]   my brother knew what I was all about
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.100]   and we went to Baylor together.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.680]   So he was right there.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.320]   But then when you have friends and they also know
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.240]   that's not what Nicodemus is about.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.380]   'Cause I said it, I made it known early on
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.960]   and they never, I didn't really have to deal
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.740]   with that peer pressure from them
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.140]   'cause they knew what it was.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.100]   So my friends helped me stay consistent
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.360]   because I wasn't getting that 24/7 pressure from them.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.780]   It was a little bit easier then I think
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.360]   when I was in college is when Facebook
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.740]   really started getting popping.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.820]   So I didn't have like the pressure to be cool on social
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.300]   and to socially do this and that and this and that.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.400]   But I just, I knew early on,
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.220]   my mom tells me this story all the time.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.620]   I like four years old,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.100]   I would stand on the table in a restaurant
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.980]   and my name is Nicodemus,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.740]   which is the story of Nicodemus going to Jesus by night
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.780]   and Jesus saying, you must be born again.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.480]   So I would stand on the table and be like,
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.500]   you must be born again, right?
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.780]   This is before I even know.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.820]   So I just, I knew that there was a calling on my life early
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.820]   and I just tried to do everything that I could.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.840]   You and I have talked about it.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.980]   I made a million mistakes.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.260]   There's a million other mistakes that you can make
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.440]   other than smoking and drinking and watching pornography.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.520]   Those are just the three
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.960]   that I've had the mental fortitude not to do.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.660]   - And now you're married, you know,
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.960]   you got the, you got a little Nicodemus
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.860]   and I've seen it, we'll be out, you know,
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.620]   and there's sometimes girls around and things like that
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.220]   and they'll approach you, they'll come up to you
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.740]   and are you single?
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.420]   My friend really likes you, things like that.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.100]   And not even just athletes, but the majority of men
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.300]   when they have like, you know, pretty girls approach him
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.700]   and things like that, it is very hard,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.260]   especially, you know, you're on the road,
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.140]   got your own hotel room, you know,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.980]   you could do something and nobody knows about it.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.180]   Like, I know that's something that in my profession
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.980]   and just in my realm of,
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.500]   that's something that people struggle with.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.980]   You know, I really respect a dude who gets married
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.180]   and then he can, he stays faithful
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.560]   because for me, I'm not getting married
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.180]   until I've developed the discipline to know for a fact
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.940]   I could be faithful to one woman for the rest of my life.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.640]   But you, I've seen it over and over,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.360]   you kind of like have a firm, like barrier, like, no,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.500]   I'm like, and you're cool with a lot of these girls.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.220]   Like you're friends with females and things like that,
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.020]   but it never crosses a certain line.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.900]   Is that discipline that you have to develop
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.540]   or is it just something you've always had?
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.980]   Or is it like a daily, is it like a daily day?
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.800]   - It's getting connected to that source
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.820]   first thing in the morning.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.900]   'Cause when we talk about discipline, I'll tell you,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.020]   like, I have to stay connected to God
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.320]   'cause apart from him, shoot,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.460]   there's nothing under the sun that I wouldn't do 100%.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.980]   Like most people that put up this fake facade,
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.080]   I'm just like everybody else.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.380]   The only thing that keeps me set apart
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.860]   is the fact that I connect to God on a daily basis
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.820]   and get a vision for my life
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.060]   and just say yes to what leads me to that vision
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.700]   and no to what takes me away from that vision.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.540]   And then you've heard me talk about Dr. Miles Monroe.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.780]   I think I quoted him earlier.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.060]   He said something that stuck with me that I heard years ago.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.260]   He said, "Make sure that your private life
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.580]   "is safe enough for public consumption."
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.420]   - 100%.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   - And you look at some of the greatest athletes
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.460]   in the world, you look at some of the greatest CEOs
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.620]   in the world, you look at some of the greatest politicians
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.360]   in the world, at some point,
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.140]   what happened in the dark came to light.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.660]   - Is that the dude that you gave me his book,
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.500]   the character? - The book, yeah.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.900]   "Kingdom Principles," yeah.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.420]   - Well, there was one, there was a book,
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.240]   I think you might have given me--
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.080]   - About character. - Character.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.840]   - Power and character of leadership.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.100]   - Yeah, is that right? - Yeah, he wrote that book
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:45.940]   as well, yeah.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.240]   - Because I was reading that book and it was so true
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.400]   that it doesn't matter how big you get,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.200]   how much money you have, how much influence you have,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.420]   you can lose so much credibility,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.040]   you can lose all these things in a moment of weakness.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.360]   And I know for a lot of dudes,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.880]   for a lot of dudes, it's the lust thing.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.140]   They got a wife, but they may slip up here or here.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.160]   And it's just, it's such a hard thing to keep intact.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.720]   And I joke around a lot about,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   maybe we weren't supposed to be monogamous,
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.680]   maybe back in the day when these dudes had
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.760]   all these wives and all these concubines,
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   it really is against our biology to be with one woman
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.840]   like the rest of our life.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.040]   That takes a certain amount of discipline.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.880]   It really doesn't.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.580]   I see it from you and I've seen it from my dad,
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.660]   so I know it's possible, but a lot of guys,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.980]   they never get that discipline.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.040]   And I just think, in this day and age,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.520]   marriage is not really a coveted thing anymore.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.940]   It's like people don't really want that.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.960]   And it's cool to see.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.480]   - It's not easy, though, bro.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.060]   It's difficult.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.740]   But like I said, you have to stay connected to the source
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.960]   and you have to have something that's greater than that.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.240]   Because if you think about it,
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.260]   you sleep with one woman while you're married,
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.360]   what's gonna stop you from sleeping with the next woman?
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.160]   Then you start a pattern.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.420]   And those patterns start to predict
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.900]   where you're gonna go in the future.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.540]   So then that's gonna be what your future looks like.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.020]   So instead of even starting that pattern,
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.540]   and for me, I know I have addictive behaviors.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.820]   That's the other reason why I don't smoke
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.180]   and I didn't drink and didn't watch pornography
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.820]   and don't cheat on my wife,
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.020]   is 'cause I know I have addictive behaviors.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.400]   Naturally, our inclination is to satisfy our flesh
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.420]   by whatever means, and I will become addicted
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.200]   to whatever pattern I start.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.080]   So I just err on the side
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.420]   of not starting those patterns whatsoever.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   And then the other thing is now,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.500]   is like I couldn't even imagine having that conversation
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.660]   with Nicodemus II ever.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.480]   Like there's nothing that I don't even know
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.980]   how I would approach having to go to him and say,
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.040]   "Well, I cheated on your mom.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.680]   "This is why duh, duh, duh, duh."
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.740]   Like I couldn't even bring myself
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.960]   to have that conversation with him.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.920]   So that's a part of it now, too.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.760]   - 100%.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.020]   Do you think you just have to find a girl
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.960]   who would work for that specific marriage?
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.460]   'Cause for me, I know with my career and what I'm doing,
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.540]   I need a girl who's gonna hold it down at the crib,
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.100]   who when I do wanna have children, she's there for them,
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.980]   and I'll go out and provide financially and she can,
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.120]   I guess that's more traditional
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.580]   and I feel like that's just kinda being lost.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.740]   What is your thoughts on that?
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.880]   - It comes down to managing expectations.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.920]   And that's one of the things where for you,
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.760]   that's one of the things that you've taught me
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.020]   quite a few things, but bro,
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.200]   one of the biggest things that you've taught me
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   is the ability to be unapologetically 100% authentic.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.140]   So anybody who enters a relationship with you,
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.780]   especially a relationship that's going to end in marriage,
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.780]   you will have at some point communicated your beliefs
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.180]   and your expectations for that marriage.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.440]   - Doesn't make me either roll with it or not.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.960]   - Hands down, right?
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.380]   Like you are unapologetically, you're you
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.560]   and you're very strong in what you believe,
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.420]   you're gonna say it and it's like, this is who I am.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.660]   Like this is the type of woman I want to raise my kids.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.400]   That's not you, then it's not you, straight up.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.460]   That's healthy though, that's healthy.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.140]   And I think a lot of marriages and a lot of relationships
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:31.000]   fail because you don't manage those expectations.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.620]   Like you've taught me that and you've helped me.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.980]   This is what I expect.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.780]   This is what my expectations are for marriage.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.880]   This is expectations for our morals and values.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.020]   This is where we believe.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.040]   Where do you stand on that?
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.100]   How do you stand on that?
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.740]   It literally comes down to managing expectations
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.180]   because there might be somebody else who sits here
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:53.160]   and it's like, my wife can do X, Y, Z
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.140]   and I'll just sit back and you know what I mean?
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.300]   'Cause there's guys who believe completely opposite
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.780]   of what you believe and they're gonna go get married.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.780]   And they're gonna marry the woman
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.160]   that you don't want to marry
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.380]   but they've managed those expectations.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.780]   You can't wait till you're married
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.700]   to have those conversations either.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.660]   That's the one thing I appreciate about you.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.160]   Like you might go on a date.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.760]   You might have those first night over pasta.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.920]   You might air it out night number one.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.620]   Bro, we've been at business dinners.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.720]   We've been at every type of dinner, any type of event.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.880]   And I've seen you air it out to people that were just meeting
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.400]   at the table.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.680]   But that's, I mean, the manager side of me sometimes
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.200]   is like, well, this business deal is over.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.160]   But you being my brother and my friend,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.140]   I respect that so much because it's like,
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.340]   you set the expectation and that's who you are.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.020]   So if you don't do that in a marriage,
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.460]   it's gonna fail straight up.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.220]   You don't get five years down the line
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.640]   and then something pops up and you've already said I do.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.860]   And now you're trying to figure it out.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.660]   And you definitely can't wait till you have kids
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.140]   because then you're trying to mold this human being.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.780]   And if you're trying to mold this human being
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:12.780]   into two separate types of values and core beliefs,
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.480]   that's when it gets difficult.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.320]   - I agree.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.860]   Sierra, have you and Christian had this conversation?
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.120]   - We're doing this book right now,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.560]   "101 Questions to Ask Before You Get Engaged"
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.040]   and it talks about a lot of things.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.980]   - Are you gonna be okay with taking his last name
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.300]   or is he gonna have to tell you?
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.940]   - Yeah, I don't have a problem with you.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.800]   (laughing)
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.140]   - All right, good.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.700]   All right, my last question for you, bro,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.660]   is we've talked about peace.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.620]   We've talked about identity.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.040]   We've talked about purpose and all these things.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.460]   For you specifically,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.300]   what do you believe to be your purpose on this earth?
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.300]   Do you believe like you're feeling it as we speak
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.140]   and kind of what are your goals?
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.560]   - Yeah, no, I definitely think I'm fulfilling it as we speak.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.100]   That's a great question.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   It took me 30 plus years to figure out what my purpose was
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.940]   and it's interesting like from the day,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.700]   I almost still remember around the time or the season
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.820]   where I figured it out
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.980]   and how things just continually started to improve
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.400]   from a mental standpoint, spiritual standpoint,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.420]   just holistically all the way around.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.860]   For me, my purpose is to help people walk
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.340]   from vision to value, right?
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.260]   So that's why I keep talking about identity
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.560]   because I think that if you don't have a vision,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.140]   it's to help people discover their vision for their life
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.500]   and then once you've gotten to the point
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.720]   to where you've discovered the vision for your life,
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.540]   help you to produce value,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.140]   the value that that vision or your purpose
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.100]   predestines you to produce
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.360]   and I think that there's two sides of value.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.680]   So there's the value that you produce for the marketplace
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.660]   or the industry that you're in
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.920]   but then on the flip side is there's an exchange of value.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.740]   When I produce value, I receive value, right?
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.400]   From the most simple terms,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.100]   if you're looking for a professional athlete,
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.520]   if I'm producing this value
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.440]   that comes in a form of performance
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.680]   for the National Basketball Association,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.720]   in return, I'm gonna receive a contract
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.460]   that shows the value that I'm producing.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.260]   So for me, it's simply put,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.480]   it's like helping people walk from vision to value, right?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.880]   And along those steps, it takes discovery of who you are,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.580]   it takes development,
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.740]   it takes finding a way to deliver that value
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.380]   to the right marketplace, to the right people
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.900]   and then in return, receiving that value
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.540]   that you've delivered to the marketplace.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.220]   So like that's where I function every single day.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.940]   - Well, man, I feel like you dropped a lot of knowledge
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.580]   for everybody to listen to
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.720]   and even for me, so go get that book.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.580]   What's the book called again?
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.580]   - Out of Order.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.500]   - Out of Order.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.260]   I've already started it and it's really good.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.960]   Something I'm definitely implementing in my own life.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.980]   So go cop that book Out of Order
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.200]   and I appreciate you being on The Pocket.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.040]   - Likewise.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   You gotta tell people about our situation
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.840]   in the weight room in college.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   - Oh yeah, I was gonna,
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.360]   'cause me and him almost weren't friends
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.720]   'cause I almost had to put hands on him
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.280]   is what he's talking about.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.720]   This is all the way back.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.120]   You know, I weigh 230 now,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.180]   but I probably was what, like 190 at Mizzou
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.360]   and I almost whooped him because this is,
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.560]   I'm gonna tell from my perspective,
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.400]   then you can tell from your perspective.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.700]   - Please do.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.500]   - So I got hurt already, so you know what I mean?
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.620]   I'm throughout the course of the season,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:33.880]   I'm doing my rehab, getting my extra weight room sessions in
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.180]   this and that.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.560]   I hit Nick up before a game like,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.820]   yo, let's get this extra lift in, whatever.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.600]   Meanwhile, these dudes in Mizzou,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.860]   I don't know about other schools,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.880]   but at Mizzou, they were trying to make us go to class.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.360]   Now, I would finesse my way out of it.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.620]   I would, you know, go until the class checkers came
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.080]   and then I would dip.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.480]   But they had us trying to go to class, tutors.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.320]   People always ask me like,
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.640]   did I get paid to go to Mizzou?
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.560]   I didn't get anything.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.040]   And they're still trying to make me go to class.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.080]   So they had me doing the most.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.260]   So I hit him like, yo,
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.700]   let's get this extra lift in before this game.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.760]   And meanwhile, I just got done with tutoring.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.100]   Like my tutoring session went forever.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.680]   And so I showed up five minutes late to the lift
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.080]   and this dude is already like, he has an attitude.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.360]   Like he's already putting up the equipment, whatever.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.140]   So I'm walking away and I'm like, bro, what are you doing?
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.020]   Like, I'm hot because I already was mad
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.860]   that I was a tutor.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.320]   And so I walk in the way and I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.280]   And then he like says something crazy.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.360]   So we ended up about to scrap really like,
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.260]   I forget like how close we got,
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.840]   but I think like I started talking crazy.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.000]   You started talking crazy to me.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.160]   And like, it was really about to like, like go down.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.320]   Like that's from my perspective.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.440]   - That's definitely not how it happened.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.560]   Okay, so the truth of it,
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.520]   'cause I was talking to see before we even started,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.840]   I was like, I wonder if Michael is gonna go there
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.960]   and tell that story.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.720]   But yeah, so from my perspective, you did.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.540]   Kudos to you.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.000]   You hit me up and wanted to get an extra lift.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.400]   So obviously I take the time to get there
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.800]   before you're there.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.720]   I set it up and all that.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.200]   I look at the clock, you're late.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.160]   So because you're late, lift is over.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.180]   It's done so, just straight up.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.260]   So I start putting this stuff away.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.180]   When I start putting this stuff away,
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.580]   that's when you walk in the weight room
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.340]   and you were like, what's good or whatever.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.820]   I was like, no lift.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.860]   You're like, what do you mean?
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.220]   I was like, you're late.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.100]   And then that's when you, he started raising his voice.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.040]   You talk about, what are you doing?
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.080]   I'll never forget.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.860]   I remember that's how it started.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.140]   You were like, what are you doing?
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.580]   And then you just went in.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.180]   You started talking crazy, crazy.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.700]   Like, what are you doing?
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.220]   Bro, you trippin', duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.760]   And I'm like, I'm young obviously.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.020]   So I'm like, I'm not the one.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.980]   So I started going back.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.380]   You start getting louder and you're like,
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.700]   you got me messed up, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.900]   So then that's when I remember I closed the weight room doors
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.980]   'cause that's when we got to, it was about to get hectic.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.820]   I closed the weight room doors and I was like,
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.960]   so how you wanna handle this, right?
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.020]   (both laughing)
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.420]   I'm professional, yes.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   But I'm like, okay, so how you wanna handle this?
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.380]   He's like duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.660]   And we went on and on and on and on for a little bit.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.860]   And then, bro, I always, it's funny when you tell that story
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.140]   because people are asking me like,
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.540]   how did you and Mike get to the point
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.020]   to where you guys have the relationship
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.600]   that you have and you have trust?
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   I'm like, because like we've gone,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.140]   there's nothing that we haven't gone,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.800]   like we have confrontations with each other.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.500]   We push each other to be the best, point blank, period.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.140]   So that's why I know that I can trust him
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.320]   and he knows that I can trust, we can trust each other.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.640]   So, bro, with that, yeah, dude lost his mind that day.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.880]   Talk about what are you doing?
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.600]   You got me messed up.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.000]   No, I'm lifted.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.920]   Try to tell me what to do in my weight room.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.440]   - So what would have happened
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.040]   if we got the scrappy thing?
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.520]   'Cause at that point I was pretty strong.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.660]   - I would have dropped you.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.620]   (both laughing)
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.460]   I would have dropped you.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.320]   - You can ask her, "See, when I get--"
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.360]   - See, cut the camera, you can do it.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.200]   I would have dropped it.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.960]   - "When I get mad, how strong do I get?"
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.680]   "How strong do you get from these two?"
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.160]   - It used to get bad.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.240]   - But that doesn't mean that you,
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.560]   I mean, I'm sure, you know,
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.240]   we do the boxing and stuff in the off season,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.640]   so I'm sure your hands are improved,
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.680]   but you would have got dropped.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.640]   - It's cool.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.920]   Nah, you aren't pretty, bro.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.760]   - Well, we'll find your picture of your size.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.600]   - And then we can--
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.320]   - I still have his before picture, too,
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.060]   that we take, I'll send it to you.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.680]   - And let people decide what they think with the one.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.520]   - That's funny.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.360]   - Well, I appreciate you, bro.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.840]   - Nah, I appreciate you having me on, bro.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.960]   - Yes, sir.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.800]   ♪ Dreams and PJs ♪
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.520]   - I always just think that I was really quick
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.640]   to get mad when you tried to throw me with the banister.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.480]   - That was young.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.920]   I was like four, I was like--
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.760]   - We were not four,
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.200]   'cause we were in the second house, I think.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.600]   - No, we were in the--
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.680]   - 'Cause the banister was at the House of Fishers.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.600]   - Dude tried to throw you over at banisters?
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.880]   - Yes, we had a banister.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.160]   - I was a young boy, she had me so high.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.240]   - This man from the hallway, hardwood floor down there.

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:55.900]   - This guy that wasn't here,

[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.840]   I think it's 'cause I took his lightsaber,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.580]   - I forget, I was so hot, dude was heated.
