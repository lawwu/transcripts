[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.840]   Today my guest is Kathy Fetke from TheRealWealthNetwork.com.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.960]   Kathy is an expert in real estate investing.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.280]   Kathy, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   Thank you.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   Great to be here.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.440]   Let's start off with your story.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.840]   You have a unique and interesting story.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.840]   How did you stumble across the world of real estate investing?
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.640]   Well, it was a bit by accident both times, really.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.800]   The first time was when my father was panicking because he had invested in an apartment building,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.760]   but he kind of not paid attention to it.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400]   It was being managed by somebody else.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   It was a group of investors.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   And they didn't manage it well.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.040]   They didn't take care of it.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.160]   And then they sold it because I think there were so many vacancies and vandalism and just
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.440]   the whole area went downhill.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.560]   And so having had that apartment for many, many years and depreciating it, he would have
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.840]   owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes, which he didn't have because he was literally
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.760]   just about to retire.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.720]   And all of that money was his retirement and he would have had to pay it to taxes.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.440]   So we have this wonderful thing called a 1031 exchange where if you sell one asset, you
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.920]   can exchange it into another.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.640]   But you have to do it in 45 days.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.320]   Now these managers were not even respectful enough to give my father a phone call.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.000]   All he received was a letter.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.840]   By the time he received it, he had about two weeks left to find that replacement property.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.200]   So we jumped in.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520]   I had just literally been married.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.760]   We were renting and my husband and I said, "Hey, is the biggest stress here that you
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.400]   just need to find a new property?"
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520]   My dad's in retirement, so he didn't want to be a landlord or anything.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.800]   So we said, "Listen, we'll find the property.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   We'll live in it.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   We'll be your tenants.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   We'll take care of everything.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Don't worry."
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   And we did.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   That's how we got into our first property.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.040]   Dave: Did you have any experience or goal of doing this or you just stumbled across it
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.520]   and realized that you had an opportunity?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.400]   Suzanne: It was really more a labor of love.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   He was so stressed out and really becoming ill.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.960]   Some people have different skills.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.440]   For me, at that age in my life, there was nothing stressful to me about that.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.040]   It was, "Tell me what you're looking for.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040]   I'll find it."
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   I literally found it.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.160]   He needed it to be a certain price range because when you exchange, of course, it has to be
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.560]   the same price or more of what was sold.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.180]   And so it had to be around $500,000, which in the San Francisco Bay Area is pretty easy
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.520]   to do.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   But we wanted it to be a place we would live in.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.560]   So we just found this.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.920]   I saw a sign on the road and I turned in and there it was.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   That's it.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   It was a big 4,000 square foot, six bedroom home.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.680]   It was beautiful, my dream home.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.120]   It was so large.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.240]   It had an in-law unit and a separate area for an office.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   I said, "Oh my gosh.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   I can just turn this into a fourplex really easily.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   We can live in the main part of the house and rent the rest and take care of this situation
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   for my dad."
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   It just ended up being a miracle for us because we were able to refinance it later.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.560]   The timing, without us knowing, was perfect.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.920]   It was '97, so the bottom of the last downturn.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   So we were able to buy it at the bottom.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.320]   Every single year after that, it went up $100,000 in value.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.760]   We were able to refinance it, pay my dad anything back that he'd ever put into the property
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.840]   prior to that.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.160]   So it boosted his retirement further and he never had to pay those taxes.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.260]   The way it works here is that once he passed away, that property stepped up to market value.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.520]   We inherited it and those taxes were wiped out.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.360]   It was just a huge win-win.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   That's how we got our start.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.440]   Dave: Fortuitous timing is always helpful when putting together a real estate deal,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   isn't it?
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.760]   Julie: Yes, and jumping in and just doing it too.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.840]   Not stupidly, but we saw this was a beautiful home.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.120]   Where we went well, I think, on this is that we did buy in a really nice neighborhood with
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.520]   really good schools and at the bottom of the market.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.240]   It was just, literally, because it was right before real estate went up for 10 years.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.360]   By 2008, about 10 years later, or 2007, that house was worth $1.8 million.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   We had paid $500.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   Then, of course, the next year it was worth about $800 again.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.680]   Dave: So you said both times you got into real estate.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.200]   What do you mean by the second time?
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   Julie: Well, the second time, we had for 10 years been renting out these little pockets
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.800]   of the house.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   We never shared space.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.080]   We literally turned it into separate living areas like a fourplex.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.000]   Really, we barely paid anything to live in this beautiful home.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.680]   We'd become landlords without really trying, I guess you could say, because we just learned
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.920]   how to rent and collected income and took care of the property.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   About 2012, my husband was doing really well.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.480]   He had just published a book called Extreme Success.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   It was based on his extreme sports and how that ties to life.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.920]   What it takes to overcome fears and really live the ultimate life.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.360]   Of course, he related that to jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and jumping off Half
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:55.320]   Dome in '70 and surfing tornado waves and all sorts of things, tsunami waves.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.560]   Everything was going great.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.720]   His New York publishers, Simon & Schuster, were kind of billing him as the new Tony Robbins.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   We couldn't be happier.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.640]   We had this big, beautiful house and helping mom and dad.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   His career's taking off.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.880]   We had two beautiful children.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.880]   It was my dream, organic garden in the yard.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   I was in the kitchen cooking from the vegetables from our garden blissfully, just happy as
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.680]   could be.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.600]   My husband literally proposed to me in a prince suit, so I felt like a princess.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.840]   He walks in the door with tears in his eyes.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.600]   The only time he ever cries is tears of joy.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.760]   These were not tears of joy.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   I said, "What's wrong?"
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   I dropped everything.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.920]   He said he had just come from the doctor for a routine check.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   This freckle on his forehead and leg turned out to be melanoma and very fast moving.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.560]   They did more tests and it looked like it had moved to his liver, in which case the
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.240]   doctor said, "If that's the case, you have six months to live."
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.200]   That was a game changer.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.520]   He is totally healthy today.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.520]   Everything's fine.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.960]   The doctor was wrong, but at the time, we didn't know.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.320]   I said, "If you have six months to live, you better live.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.880]   We have these two young children.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   Spend time with them.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.360]   Spend time with your friends and family.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.720]   I'll figure out the money piece."
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:34.400]   At the time, I was a stay-at-home mom, but I had been in broadcasting most of my life.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.960]   I had this radio show in San Francisco.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.040]   I think it was KNEW at the time.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.840]   I just thought, "Okay, I'm going to use this platform to interview wealthy people and just
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.440]   millionaires, people who became millionaires overnight through their own effort.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.560]   I'm going to learn what they did and I'm going to do this so my husband can rest and that
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.400]   we have the money we need."
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   Of course, medical bills blew up.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.840]   It was pretty tough during that time.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.400]   I interviewed millionaire after millionaire to learn their secrets.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.880]   It came often to two things.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.720]   They either had a business, a very successful business, and/or they owned real estate.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   That's what we did.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   We went to real estate.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.360]   Why did you choose that instead of a business?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   It ended up being both, actually, because we'd had businesses all our lives, so we knew
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   that.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.060]   I wanted something where if the doctor was right, I didn't know really at the time how
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.400]   to run a business that didn't involve me.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.680]   I didn't know how to run a self-managed business.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   I wanted something that would allow me to raise my children.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.240]   I didn't want to be gone all day and be busy.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.120]   Real estate seemed to be a choice where I could be more passively involved and be able
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:09.600]   to do what we had done, which is rent out space and have income come in.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.560]   At the same time, I needed money that day.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.520]   I started calling people to sponsor my show.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   One after the other, I went down the list.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.560]   I'm like, "Okay, this is some quick money."
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   I couldn't get anybody.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.120]   It was always, "No, no, no."
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.160]   I would literally call somebody who had just advertised on another show before me and say,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.600]   "Hey, you want to advertise on my show?"
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   It was, "No, we already spent our budget."
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.040]   I'm like, "No, no, no, no.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   Down the list."
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   Finally, I thought, "You know what?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.440]   I really need money.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.720]   I need it today.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.840]   We've blown our savings, everything.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   It's a tough time."
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.000]   I thought, "My next phone call, I am going to make an offer the person who answers the
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.480]   phone cannot refuse."
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.880]   I boosted the amount of money I wanted significantly.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.200]   I asked for a ton of money, but instead I said, "When I called, how would you like to
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   co-host with me?
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.000]   I will make you a local celebrity and here's the price."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   He answered, "Yes."
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.080]   I ended up getting a lot of money from him that helped with our bills, but even more
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.240]   importantly, he was a mortgage broker who specialized in real estate investing.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.440]   It was a perfect mix.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   On the show, which is the Real Wealth Show, I still have it today, I had no idea that
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   something that has to do with mortgages could be interesting to anybody.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.000]   I came home and told my husband, "Oh my gosh, I've just sold my soul.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now my show is going to be so boring.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.560]   It's going to be on mortgages."
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   He just laughed.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.480]   He's like, "Oh, you'll figure it out."
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.160]   I would recommend human interest.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   I was like, "Oh, okay.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.080]   We'll find out what people are doing with these mortgages."
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.440]   Once again, I interviewed one after the other, "What are you getting a mortgage for?"
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   "Oh, I'm buying this investment property here and it's doing this."
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   That person, "Well, I refined my home and I was able to invest it in these properties
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   and now we're retired."
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.400]   All these fantastic stories behind the mortgage.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.320]   Our phones started to blow up.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.160]   Everybody wanted a mortgage.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.840]   My co-host now said, "Listen, get your real estate license.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   I can't handle it.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.540]   This show is far more successful than I expected.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.540]   Get your license.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.840]   You can't take all of these loans."
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.120]   I did.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.800]   This was back in the mid-2000s where you could make a whole lot of money doing loans.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's harder today.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I did.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.920]   I got my license literally that month.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.580]   Suddenly, I was one of the busiest mortgage brokers in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.620]   We just had phones ringing off the hook.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.280]   My very first loan was a million dollar loan.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.580]   I made $10,000 and our financial troubles were over.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.240]   You said you were a stay-at-home mom, but you also had the radio show.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.780]   Did you have the radio show the whole time or did you go and get it when you decided
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.980]   that you needed to earn income?
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.980]   No.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.100]   I loved broadcasting.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.100]   I studied broadcasting.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.580]   I worked at CNN and Fox and ABC.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.620]   I loved news.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:14.940]   I needed something to keep for myself, so I kept that show while having young children.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   It didn't take a lot of time.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.740]   It was just once a week.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.540]   I kept that, but I changed it because at the time, it had been more newsy and a little
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.340]   bit more Oprah style.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.140]   Then I completely changed it to real estate and wealth building.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:38.700]   When your husband was diagnosed with this disease, was he working at the time?
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.500]   He was traveling the country promoting his new book, Extreme Success.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.060]   He'd been given a big advance from Simon Schuster and he was business coaching.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.220]   Still is today, but mostly our company.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.220]   Coaching businesses all over the country, really just at the peak of his success.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.980]   When you get that word from your doctor that you've got six months, let me tell you that
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.700]   the last thing he wanted to do was coach people in business.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.620]   We just wanted him to be able to have those last six months be great.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.700]   He still did a little coaching, but not very much.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:25.180]   Once he came back completely fine and healthy, then he went back to coaching.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.840]   By then, this business I started had just taken off.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.100]   He also started with that.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.100]   Now he's my co-CEO.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.260]   Now we have 24,000 investor members.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.460]   We're doing huge deals.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.220]   We're helping lots of people get into real estate today and either buy their first rental
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.820]   property or get into some massive land development deals we're doing.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.780]   It's a whole new world.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:57.740]   Do you remember how much your monthly bills were when he was diagnosed with his illness?
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:03.380]   It was, I'm going to say probably $10,000 a month.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.940]   Were you at that time earning any income from your radio show?
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.940]   You were just doing it as a hobby.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.220]   Were you earning anything from it?
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:15.020]   I was that typical stay-at-home mom that made enough money for the fun stuff.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:23.340]   I think I made around $2,000 a month just for vacations and stuff I wanted.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.580]   What gave you the confidence that you could go from $2,000 a month to $10,000 a month
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.340]   to cover your bills?
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.340]   Desperation.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.060]   I had no idea.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.520]   I had absolutely no idea.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.660]   I was terrified, but I had to figure it out.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.820]   Another thing we did was because we had the six-bedroom house, we ended up renting.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:53.260]   I found out about this student program where exchange students would pay $600, but you
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.300]   could stick four of them in a room.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   They didn't care.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.540]   I got bunk beds and I had four students in a room.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.340]   We just took the kids' playroom away.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.500]   I mean, you do what you have to do, right?
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   No.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   Many people don't do what they have to do.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.820]   That's why I'm zeroing in on it because I think that's one of the most interesting aspects
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:23.340]   of your story is how you can go from a low income to a high income and then figuring
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.060]   out the plan along the way.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:32.620]   My observation has been many times the people who are successful in different things, successful
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.720]   in real estate investing or successful in business investing, it really doesn't matter
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.180]   what the path is.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.580]   It doesn't matter whether it's real estate or oil wells.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.980]   It's a matter of the character traits and the person behind it.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.740]   And then they just find a market that works.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.060]   And if the real estate market wasn't working or if the mortgage market wasn't working,
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.380]   you'd find something else.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.380]   Absolutely.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:16:00.220]   And so to me, your story demonstrates how for some reason, somehow, you were able to
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.460]   find some ideas and then to pursue a path when you needed to.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.460]   And adversity seems to bring out in some people their best where they say, "We're going to
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.900]   make this work out."
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.380]   And it brings out in some people their worst where they kind of sit down and get depressed
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.020]   and say, "I'm not going to do anything."
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:22.860]   And so to me, I'm interested in what makes a difference in the person.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.900]   The real estate is easy.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   The business is easy.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.540]   It's just a matter of learning the skills and applying them in the right context.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.100]   It's a matter of that personal skill.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.220]   So that's why I was probing there because it fascinates me.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.820]   You're so right because I will say that I do have family members who could definitely
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.380]   – they're struggling financially.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.780]   And of course, we're doing really well and I've tried to teach them the secrets and
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:53.580]   they just don't seem interested even though they absolutely have the skills, far better
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.180]   skills than I do.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.340]   So I don't know what that thing is.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:08.540]   For me, it was a labor of love wanting my husband to really enjoy those last six months
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.900]   if it was indeed true.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.540]   And again, he's healthy and happy today.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.420]   It was also my labor of love of not wanting to be the mom who is not home.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   I couldn't do it.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   I couldn't be the person who leaves the house at seven and comes home at seven and
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.260]   someone else raised my kids.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:33.020]   And then I do remember there was like this turning point of absolute 100% conviction
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   that I was going to make it happen.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.820]   There was not a shred of doubt I was going to do it and I was going to figure it out
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.540]   and there were people smarter than me.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.220]   I'm not smarter than me.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:47.600]   People less smart than me who had done what I wanted to do so why not me?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.100]   And I think that's what happened on the show is I would interview these people that
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.580]   were retired by the age of 30 and the way they did it, it's like, "Wait.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580]   Anyone can do that.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.660]   You just have to do it."
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.340]   You mentioned that when you were interviewing all these wealthy people, it was either in
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:12.100]   business or real estate.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:19.780]   Did you find that real estate, just in your experience, I know this is not academically
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.380]   rigorous objective data.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.180]   I'm just curious about your personal gut level feeling of doing those interviews.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.740]   What percentage of people had built their wealth through business, private business
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.140]   and what percentage had built it through real estate?
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.060]   That is a great question.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:41.620]   Because it ended up being a mortgage show, of course, the people I interviewed were mostly
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.220]   real estate.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:52.140]   But as I started to attract an audience who wanted that and then I suddenly overnight
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.420]   became a real estate celebrity even though I was learning it myself.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.140]   But I had this pretty big radio show and suddenly that was my focus.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.100]   I was being asked to keynote at different real estate events.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.700]   I had to learn quickly.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:14.100]   And it was in those scenarios where the audience was mostly business or many of them had spent
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:19.260]   most of their lives saving money the traditional way and just weren't happy with the way that
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.260]   went.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.380]   Just IRAs and the stock market and S&P and all that.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.940]   So, most of our members are that.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.440]   They're people who have just saved really well or they have really, really good businesses
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   and just about anything.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.820]   I mean pizza, franchises, health clubs, car parts.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.740]   There's so many different ways that people were able to find the money to use for real
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   estate.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.260]   But for my audience and the people I interviewed, we really pretty much focused on real estate
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.260]   at that point.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.580]   I just want to clarify one thing.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.860]   I believe the date that your husband was sick, was diagnosed with the illness was 2002, not
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.860]   2012.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.860]   Is that correct?
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.860]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.860]   So, you had a misspoke and said 2012.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.860]   I think I did.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.660]   So, over the last, that'd be 14 years now.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:13.700]   Over the last 14 years, set aside the network that you built and the business that you built.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.220]   What was your path into investment yourself?
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.780]   So, as we were learning, we realized, wow, we're already doing this.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   We have this house.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.820]   We've been renting every nook and cranny of it.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.780]   It was such a lifesaver to have that house because there were times we paid almost no
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.260]   rent, quote unquote rent, because we were renting everybody else, all these other rooms,
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.420]   and that was covering the expenses and some.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.540]   And so, we already knew the power of real estate from that perspective.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:54.660]   And then, as I said, it was at a time when that property gained about $100,000 per year.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.500]   So, it just made sense to do what we were hearing everybody else do, which was to refi
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.700]   and take some of the cash out and go buy property.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:12.660]   Now, fortunately, I was being given some amazing advice from these people on the show.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.500]   I'd interview like Robert Kiyosaki and Dennis Kaminsky and some pretty high level people
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.980]   because having that platform, I was able to get them to talk to me.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.780]   And many of them, offline, I would say, "All right, come on.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.900]   Tell me where you're investing.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.900]   I need to know."
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:34.980]   And for many, most, it was Texas because in the mid-2000s, we were watching California
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.940]   real estate just bubble up.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.860]   I mean, 100% of your paycheck going to basically going to pay for real estate, except for that
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.100]   little caveat that you didn't actually have to make your payment and you didn't actually
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.100]   have to qualify.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.300]   So, you could qualify for a loan based on a teaser rate.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.460]   So, when the adjustment would come, there was no way you could possibly make that payment.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.860]   And so, we knew something was wrong and these experts on the show absolutely knew something
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.100]   was wrong and they said, "California is going to have a major meltdown."
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.820]   What most people didn't know is the entire country was.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.580]   But Texas wasn't because they weren't doing those.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.400]   They had very, very strict mortgage laws.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.580]   They didn't allow 100% financing.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.140]   They didn't allow 105% financing.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.660]   In most of the country, you could get a loan on a property.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.140]   You could purchase a property, not put a penny down, but instead get 5% back.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.140]   You know, I mean, it was crazy.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.420]   You get money back for buying a home.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.060]   So, you could go buy your furniture or whatever.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.180]   Insanity.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.780]   And so, Texas didn't allow that.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:43.100]   And you couldn't refi past 80% LTV because they'd already been through it.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.500]   They had been through the SNL crisis and it wiped them out in the '80s and they weren't
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.060]   going to allow it again.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.300]   So, after that SNL crisis, the government came into Texas and said, "We're going to
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.100]   make this the most job-friendly place in the U.S.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.500]   And we're going to give tax credits and all kinds of incentives for business to come here
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.660]   and we're going to diversify out of oil."
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.260]   Because obviously, that did not work.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.020]   They went into a major recession when, you know, worse than most of the country.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.100]   So with good and strong leadership in Texas, it did work and it became the place with the
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.220]   strongest job and population growth in the country.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.020]   And our experts on the show recognized that.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.020]   And yet, home prices had not caught up.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.580]   Nobody thought anything would ever happen in Texas when it comes to real estate because
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.980]   it never had.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.180]   And so, prices were like 28% undervalued.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.860]   Salaries going up, but home prices not doing anything.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.660]   So, you know, my experts on the show were teaching us, "Hey, if you sell this overpriced
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.820]   bubble property in California and buy and instead, you know, exchange it for property
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:50.780]   in Texas, you can quadruple your cash flow and avoid the coming crash."
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.100]   And so, we didn't take all the advice.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100]   We kept the house.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:00.900]   We just refied, took some cash out and bought eight properties in this part of Texas called
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.260]   Rockwall that is now one of the nicest places in Texas to live.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.300]   But we were able to buy properties there for like $140,000, $150,000 for gorgeous brand
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.520]   new homes in this very nice part of Dallas near a lake.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.260]   And we knew, the reason we chose that is we knew that the area, they were putting in a
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:27.620]   new freeway and that would connect this kind of remote little town to Dallas and you could
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.300]   get to downtown in 20 minutes.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.580]   Whereas, at the time, you had to go around and it was going to take an hour.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.060]   So, we bought eight.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.820]   And sure enough, today, you know, those properties have doubled and it's been really lucrative.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.460]   At the same time, I said, you know, I was talking about this on the show, so my listeners
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.460]   were interested and they did do what I said.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.840]   So, I had like one lady who had three homes in Stockton, California.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.100]   She sold them based on our advice for $400,000 each.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.700]   They each rented for $1,200.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.220]   So, you know, $3,600 a month gross she was getting on those properties.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:12.940]   We were able to get her into 10 properties in Dallas that were each renting for $1,200
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.540]   as well, but brand new, in good neighborhoods.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.660]   So, she literally walked into work the next day and quit her job.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:26.100]   The next year, those properties in Stockton she sold were worth $100,000 each.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.360]   So she would have lost everything had she not, you know, sold at the peak and bought
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.660]   at the trough in Dallas.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.900]   And then, of course, since then her properties have doubled in value in Dallas.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:43.420]   So, you know, that's basically how Real Wealth Network was born was we created a place where
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.740]   investors could come and just learn from these experts, understanding market cycles and how
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.460]   to identify a bubble and how to, you know, how to invest for cash flow because Californians
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.180]   don't know anything about that.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.100]   They only invest for appreciation.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:02.180]   So when that's not happening, when you've peaked and there's not appreciation and worse,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:08.100]   you know, depreciation, values going down, then that method doesn't work.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:14.460]   So we taught this new concept of cash flow and, you know, it just took off.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.460]   So that's where we are today.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:21.600]   So how long has Real Wealth Network been around?
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:29.220]   It basically started pretty early on because, you know, because I was, I think 2003, 2004,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.860]   we were already starting little meetings because I was being asked to speak at these different
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.420]   events because I was now the host of this real estate show and everybody thought I knew
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.420]   something about it.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:44.580]   I was really just learning myself, but we were also learning and doing and I was surrounding
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.460]   myself with experts.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.900]   And so I would be asked to go speak at these real estate events and I would sit in the
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:57.580]   back of the room when I was done speaking and I would hear these, ah, people that just
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.980]   made my skin crawl, you know, and they would be talking about, you know, foreclosures and
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.620]   how to knock on doors and do this and do that.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.060]   And, you know, for $20,000 you can buy the bootcamp and learn how to do it yourself.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.860]   And I didn't know anything about foreclosures so I didn't know specifically that they were
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.360]   lying but they just, there was something sleazy about them.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.780]   And this one time I was in the back of the room with a man who actually did buy properties
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.940]   at auctions and did do foreclosures and he knew the business inside and out and he just
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.940]   tapped me on the shoulder.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.860]   And he was like, "These guys are lying.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.460]   This is not true.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.700]   What they're telling is just not true.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.960]   It's not how it's done here.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.940]   Maybe it's how they do it in Georgia or wherever they're from, but not here."
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.060]   So he raised his hand and said, "Sir, I think you've got the laws wrong here.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.540]   You can't do that here."
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.020]   And the speaker said, "Oh, okay.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.020]   We're going to take a break."
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.620]   And he comes to us because I'm sitting next to this guy and he escorts us out, tells us
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.620]   to leave.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:57.540]   That's when I realized, oh wow, the only real estate groups and investment groups at that
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:03.220]   time were just selling these boot camps and these educational programs but not really
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.260]   teaching people legit investing.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.700]   So we just saw this amazing opportunity and that's why we call it the real wealth network.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.300]   It's like I wanted people who didn't have anything to sell, that they would just be
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:20.740]   willing to come, don't wear a suit, wear your baseball cap, whatever.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   It's like the millionaire next door type.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.100]   And come and just tell us what you're doing.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.460]   And nothing's for sale.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.900]   And just make an investor group where people can legitimately learn the business.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.060]   And that's what we did.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.700]   And it just, again, it grew because there was such a starvation, such a need for real
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.220]   information.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.220]   And so that's what we do.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:48.820]   Now we charge a whopping $10 a month for our academy because we still have the belief that
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.780]   we want your money going into investment property, not into, I mean education's important and
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.980]   I'm not knocking people who charge a lot for good education.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.740]   But we just feel like we want to provide the education and make it affordable so that your
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.660]   money goes into investing.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.900]   So I don't understand fully your business model.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.780]   If you're not charging your members, how are you earning income and profiting from the
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   business?
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.780]   Well at the time I was doing mortgages.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.620]   So in the very beginning, so like I mentioned the woman in Stockton.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.400]   So I helped her buy those 10 properties in Dallas.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.820]   And so I did 10 mortgages and that was good money.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.620]   The mortgage world, the mortgage meltdown happened and then Dodd-Frank came along and
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:37.740]   there's 22,000 pages of regulations and oh my goodness.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.860]   Mortgage brokers deserve a lot of credit because it is so, so hard to get it done today.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.860]   There's so many regulations.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.660]   So I didn't want to do that anymore.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:54.420]   I went to the real estate side and decided to basically have a network across the country
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:00.140]   where we would do a referral type thing, basically realtor to realtor type thing.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.460]   So I would go to Dallas and work with the real estate agent there and say, "All right,
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.980]   you've got your 3% commission you make on these 10 properties or whatever.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.020]   I want half."
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.700]   So we co-brokered like that.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:21.220]   And that's how we still do it today because I can't sell property in Texas or Ohio or
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.960]   Indiana or Florida or any of these places where we feel the opportunities are today
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.920]   but I can co-broker with agents there.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.180]   So our members don't actually pay for our advice and our help because the broker does.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.380]   And it's not any more than they'd have to pay anyway because there's always sales
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.380]   commissions, right?
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.380]   >> Sure.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.380]   That's great.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:46.260]   So now Real Wealth Network, you have information, you're in webinars, you're doing presentations
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.820]   and whatnot for the people that are there.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.380]   And then you still have opportunities to set up referral relationships using your real
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.060]   estate license with other real estate agents so that as your members are investing in different
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.160]   locations, you're able to share in the commissions from that with the real estate agents who
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   are selling the properties.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   Is that accurate?
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   >> That's it.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.960]   Although we went one step further because it's still really hard as a, you know, we've
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.920]   got investors from all over the world.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.240]   We've got lots and lots of California investors and we're really promoting judicial states
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   right now.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.520]   These would be the states where there's still a backlog of foreclosures because of their
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.400]   very strict foreclosure laws that make it nearly impossible for a bank to foreclose.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.360]   Like Florida, I mean, it takes six years to foreclose.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.920]   It's crazy.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:37.080]   So what we've done, it's still hard for someone from California to make offers on properties
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.140]   and then oversee a renovation because a property that's been sitting in foreclosure for six
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.400]   years is going to need work.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.640]   Even if it was a brand new property at the time, it's been sitting or uncared for by
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.400]   the person who's been living there not making any mortgage payments for six years.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.840]   So we just didn't want our members to have to deal with a renovation from afar.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.960]   So we went one step further where our teams in these different areas actually buy the
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.520]   properties, renovate them, get a tenant in, a very highly qualified tenant, and offer
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.760]   ongoing property management for what we call real turnkey property.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.680]   And real is an acronym for what that means.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   It means fully renovated, fully renovated so it's like new, everything replaced, new
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:26.080]   HVAC, new pipes, new, everything updated, new roof if needed.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:33.480]   And evaluated so it's been inspected by an independent inspector and then appraised and
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.760]   then licensed property management in place so that basically an investor can come in
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.280]   and buy a rental property that's already done.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.640]   All renovated, all taken care of.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.840]   You can inspect it, appraise it, and know that it's exactly what we're saying it is.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.240]   It's just, we still, there's some people who still prefer to buy the property and oversee
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.800]   the renovation but a lot more, there's more factors there.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Things can go wrong.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.600]   I don't know if you've done a renovation or tried to, I don't know if you've tried to
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:07.160]   manage contractors in your own home but that's not even easy so it's even harder from afar.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:13.660]   The real estate business is a mixture of investment and business and it is a specialized business
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.400]   whether you're doing renovations, that's a specialized business.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.720]   Every aspect of it is a specialized business.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   And so the challenge, and I was going to ask you about this, I want to, well let's go ahead
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   and do it now.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:33.480]   The challenge is often for real estate investors, people who have the expertise of investing
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.080]   often have built that expertise partly with their own money and often they are short on
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.460]   cash especially at the beginning of their career.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.060]   So there are a few ways that you can creatively finance it.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.120]   Sometimes you can get the sellers to finance it but I have a number of friends and I think
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.880]   it's a very viable, valid business model to use other people's investment dollars who
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.680]   are looking for good returns and you take and apply your skills with developing the
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.000]   property, renovating the property, getting it rented and you're using a private investor's
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   money.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.960]   And there are a lot of people who are interested in owning real estate whether that's for the
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.640]   potential of possibly higher returns and they can get in public and trade securities whether
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.360]   that's some of the getting the benefits of the depreciation expense for their tax planning
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:26.120]   whether it's from a perspective of diversification, owning some physical tangible property in
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:32.040]   a location that they want to own it in versus having everything be paper assets.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:37.880]   There are various reasons that people could do that but it's a hard thing.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.440]   It's hard to advise somebody who's making multiple six figures doing an excellent job
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.680]   at their job to say, "Well, you should go and you should dedicate your time to investing
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.480]   and finding a local property for $200,000, fixing it up and doing it."
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.440]   A highly compensated person, it's most likely not a good use of their time to go out and
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.720]   walk away from $1,000 an hour work to do $200 an hour work.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:08.080]   So these networks and relationships and things like that can be a win-win.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.920]   It can be a win-win for both people and so I see the value of them.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:20.160]   The question always comes down to every single one of those things that you mentioned.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.240]   There's a cost along the way when you have a professional doing that service.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:30.360]   So if you have renovation, the person who is supervising that is functioning as essentially
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.840]   a contractor and they're going to be paid for their services as a contractor.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.320]   The person who's doing the evaluation or who's supervising the evaluation, there's going
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.200]   to be payment for that.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.240]   The appraisal process and then the property management is going to be put in place and
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:52.680]   sometimes I wonder if after layering on all of those layers of cost, I wonder if it's
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.800]   still worth it.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:00.840]   I wonder if the benefits are still there with regard to the actual returns from the real
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   estate.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   Because much of the real estate return potential seems to be from being able to take out and
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.160]   do – here I'm primarily thinking of single family houses.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.800]   There are many ways to invest in real estate but many of the returns of working in things
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.760]   like single family houses seems to be in taking the profit from those various activities.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:28.400]   So after your investors are going through and offering these properties to other investors,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.880]   do you have any sense of how that impacts the returns for the money investor at least?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   Here's the thing.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.120]   I brought in a – now we're a legitimate company.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.200]   Back in 2003, we were just figuring it all out and we were one of the first to figure
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:50.160]   it out and so of course, there are people who copy.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.680]   And so there's a lot of people out there who are calling themselves turnkey rental
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   properties.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.480]   You can go online and search it all day long but I can tell you that most are not.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   We turn down nine out of ten companies who say they're turnkey.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:14.640]   So I hired a Six Sigma black belt who is an expert, the highest trained expert on systems
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:21.080]   to verify when reviewing these companies that now say they're turnkey.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:27.280]   And it's so easy because our list, it's on our website, the very, very high standards
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.640]   that we expect when we call – that's why we call it real turnkey, not just turnkey.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.280]   We saw this one company that – it's these young guys who totally know how to do internet
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   marketing.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.360]   I mean they're brilliant internet marketers but they're doing exactly what you say.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.600]   They're marking up the properties far beyond what they're worth yet the renovation is
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.040]   barely done.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.360]   There's people in real estate and I think in any investment business, anywhere that
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.960]   has to do with money and big dollars that just literally don't care about the client.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   They just don't care.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.760]   They're in it for the short term and they're not going to last.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.440]   But these kids were marking up these properties and selling garbage and when my team went
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.720]   and said, "Well, I don't even think these properties look renovated and you've sold
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.360]   it in this condition."
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.440]   And the kids were like – I call them kids, they were in their early 20s – were like,
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   "Yeah, we've got a wait list."
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.800]   We're like, "Do these people ever come out and look at these properties and see what
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   they're buying?"
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   And they go, "Oh no.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.760]   They just look at the pictures we send them."
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.840]   So don't think that what I'm saying is easy for anyone to duplicate.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.500]   Many have tried and it hasn't gone well for them.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.240]   We are extremely strict on what we look for.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.160]   Because I'm representing investors and I want a long term business where those investors
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.600]   rave about us and they do.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   And so if we find a company who's got their systems in place and they're doing volume
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.000]   because they're so good at what they do, well then they're going to get materials much,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.920]   much cheaper than the individual.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.160]   So I could go out and try to buy a property in Florida and renovate it and you still have
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.520]   to hire the construction people.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.360]   You still have to do all that.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.120]   The difference is I'm going to pay more for my materials and my contractors than the company
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.520]   who's doing 20 a month has contractors in-house.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.920]   They've got deals with suppliers or they have their own supply companies.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:31.640]   So it's a model where actually in the end it comes in cheaper.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.120]   So that's the beautiful thing.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.680]   It's happened so many times at our events.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   I'll have somebody come running up to the front of the room, grab my mic, and I'm not
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.280]   sure what they're going to say.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.840]   And this guy will say, "I'm a real estate agent.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.960]   I have been buying properties in Florida for years.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.360]   I fly out there.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.960]   I pay for hotels, airplanes.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.240]   I hire my teams.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.960]   I've got my real estate team in place and I cannot bring it in at these prices or at
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.840]   this level because it's just harder."
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:10.020]   And so it's really the opposite is true with the teams we work with where our investors
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.080]   are still getting it much cheaper than if they did it on their own.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.120]   And it's all done for them, all managed for them.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.200]   And yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.000]   They do need to come out of pocket for that appraisal and that inspection.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.040]   But those are $300, $400 and well worth every penny.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.960]   And to have that inspection come back looking perfect gives you a lot of satisfaction.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   And same with the appraisal.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.720]   A lot of times the appraisal comes in over.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   That makes you feel good.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.440]   Sometimes it comes in under, but there's reasons for that.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.280]   Appraisals, they're hard to do when in an area where there's a lot of foreclosures,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.920]   it's hard to get the comps.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.260]   But we always work it out.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:51.600]   And because we are a really powerful network now that when we find a team, we refer really
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.080]   high level, really high level investors to that team.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.480]   And the last thing they want to do is ruin this relationship.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:05.680]   So if one of our investors is unhappy with something, that company is going to take care
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.200]   of it.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.920]   And to the level of what's fair.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.040]   Obviously real estate, things happen and sometimes things happen that you don't expect.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.960]   Maybe a pipe breaks or something that didn't come up in the inspection.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:24.320]   But in most cases, the company, the turnkey provider will go way beyond what would be
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.640]   normal to keep our investors happy because they want rave reviews.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:39.160]   As we record this interview in July 19, 2016, what are the trends that you see for US American
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.680]   real estate prices?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.000]   It's a great question.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.680]   I've had nothing but economists on my show.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   Well, I've had a lot more.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.320]   We do a lot of success stories.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.120]   But I'm still interviewing people to figure out what in the world is going on in this
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   country.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.600]   It is craziness.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.720]   The consensus seems to come to bread and butter.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.080]   If you can really stay within the bread and butter properties, the good, hardworking Americans,
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.640]   the working class of America, what we call the B neighborhoods, the middle class, in
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.160]   the markets where prices, where fundamentals are still in place.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.840]   In other words, if the average income of the area is $50,000, then the average home price
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.760]   should not be over $150,000.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.800]   Whereas in California, the average income might be $100,000, but the average home price
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.640]   is a million or something like that.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.600]   And that's just not sustainable.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.200]   So bread and butter America in areas where there are sustainable jobs, not jobs that
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   come and go.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.480]   And let me tell you, jobs come and go every year because technologies are changing so
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.520]   rapidly.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.040]   So an example is Reno, Nevada.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:54.380]   We're doing actually more syndications, group investments, where we're pooling investor
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.560]   funds and buying land there.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:02.480]   You know, Tesla's just gone in and put in the first of their battery factories that's
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.680]   the size of a football field, and there's going to be 10 of those.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.400]   Now, do you think Tesla's going anywhere?
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.320]   Do you think they're going to be out of business next year?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.720]   I doubt it.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:17.660]   So to be able to provide housing in an area like that, where there's 50,000 jobs expected
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:24.080]   in that area, and there's only been 800 new homes every year, there's a need for housing.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.360]   I'm not worried about an area like that.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:34.040]   But when you go to another place that's maybe more dependent on the stock market or companies
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.160]   that might be dead tomorrow, I mean, I'll give you an example, retail.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.280]   Retail's struggling, and it's going to continue to struggle.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.040]   Retail REITs, you know, they're not doing well because, and when I say retail, it's
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.280]   like shopping centers, because, you know, what's changing?
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.720]   What's changing is the way people buy.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.880]   And when that, that's what we have to pay attention to.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:03.520]   And so my 24-year-old millennial daughter is working for a company called Build.com,
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:09.840]   where people buy their construction materials online for cheap.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.480]   How's that going to affect these big box stores?
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.280]   You know, more and more, I told on another show, in Malibu, our daughter just went to
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   a prom.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   And I asked her, you know, are you going to go shopping?
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.680]   And she's like, oh yeah, my friends are coming over, we're going to shop this afternoon.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.480]   What do you mean?
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   Online.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.760]   So they all got together at our house, and they all bought their prom dresses online.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.320]   When I bought prom dresses, we went to Macy's.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.980]   So you know, it's, everything's changing.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.640]   And so you can't do what we used to do when trying to figure out where to buy real estate.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.400]   It used to be that you would buy near big box stores.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   Not anymore.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   That's changing.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.740]   You've got to stay on top of those things and only buy where there's jobs that are not
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.240]   going away.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.040]   How would you identify a job that's not going away?
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.920]   That's the trick, right?
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:02.600]   You know, one of the, you know, one of the things that we look at are, like I said with
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.400]   the Tesla plant, you know, that's a lot of money going into that.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.280]   And Nevada wants it.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.200]   This is creating tremendous jobs.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:16.920]   And so it's looking at things that are here for the future.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.740]   And so another example might be there's a lot of places in the South where we're investing.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.500]   You know, I used to have people say, "Well, we're going to invest in Detroit because that's
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.900]   where the auto industry is."
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.060]   And you know, it's like, "Really?
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   Is it?"
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.060]   You have to really look.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.120]   Where is the auto industry?
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.820]   It's moving out of Detroit.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.960]   And so, and a lot of it's moving to the South, to warmer climates, to cheaper areas where
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:43.940]   they don't have, you know, the same kind of, I guess, what am I trying to, union type,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.940]   you know, the unions don't control.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:52.100]   And so, you know, that's, if you're going to see a Toyota or a Mercedes Benz or, you
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.220]   know, they're going to build a huge plant, it's probably going to be jobs.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.380]   Another thing we look at is, recently is the Panama Canal was just expanded.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.140]   I mean, I think just this month it finally opened to much, much larger container ships
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.260]   moving through the Panama Canal.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.660]   That means that huge container ships can now move to the East Coast instead of coming to
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.820]   Long Beach, California or Seattle and then training across the country or trucking.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.900]   Now they can just go through the canal to the East Coast.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.580]   Now, what's that going to do to the East Coast?
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:22.580]   A lot.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.740]   So, we are focused on port cities on the East Coast because, again, these are like things
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.660]   that aren't going to go away overnight.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.020]   So, for example, Jacksonville, Florida, great market.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.740]   They're expanding to be able to take on these new container ships that then is going to
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.420]   affect the whole economy because now the trucking is coming from that side, you know?
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.940]   So, just things like that.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.540]   Bigger deals, I guess you could say.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:53.700]   I want to ask you about on your website, you have Chicago, Illinois listed as, I'm not
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.380]   sure, I don't know that you're saying it's the number one market, but you have it listed
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.220]   on the top of your list.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.260]   Why Chicago, Illinois?
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.940]   That surprises me.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.380]   It's a little, you know, I'm pretty honest, I'm not pretty honest, I'm totally honest
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.500]   and upfront with how I feel about different markets.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.100]   Now, I don't like the politics of Chicago.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.520]   It's very similar to Detroit.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.700]   They have entitlement programs that they can't pay for and the city's going to go bankrupt.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.940]   It just simply can't, you can't make promises you can't keep.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.300]   I mean, all we have to do is look at, you know, Puerto Rico and, you know, Detroit and,
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.460]   you know, Chicago's headed in the same direction.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:37.100]   So, here's the thing about both Detroit and Puerto Rico.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.040]   People who bought bonds lost their money.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.620]   You know, if you bought bonds in Puerto Rico, you're not getting it back.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.620]   You didn't do your homework.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.180]   You didn't look and see that they're broke.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.180]   Can't pay you back.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.180]   But you know what?
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.940]   If you bought real estate, you're doing just fine.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.500]   So none of that affected it.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.760]   I have close friends who own property in Puerto Rico and it's only done better because now
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.940]   that whole burden of debt is gone because they defaulted, you know?
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.340]   But the real estate's there.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.180]   So they've still got renters.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.860]   They've still, you know, the property's still, it's, you know, it's a beautiful part of Puerto
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.260]   Rico and it's doing well.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.660]   Same with Detroit.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.660]   Went bankrupt.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.180]   But what did the property values do?
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.820]   They've only gone up.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:25.960]   And so Chicago is the third largest, third or fourth, it keeps changing, largest city
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.620]   in the U.S.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.060]   There is a lot of good stuff in Chicago.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.100]   It's just their politics are terrible.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.220]   And so they're going, you know, it's going to come to a head.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.700]   They can't pay these entitlements.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.660]   They're going to have to default.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.860]   And that's not really going to affect real estate at certain levels.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.260]   They have passed a bill where property taxes are going to go up 72 percent.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.380]   I mean, you know, yeah, sure, let's blame the property taxes for our massive entitlement
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.380]   programs.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.780]   But anyway, that's only affecting the higher end.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.820]   So anything under $200,000 won't be affected by that new property tax.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.420]   So what do you think that's going to do for those properties?
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:10.460]   So we're helping investors get into properties in Chicago that are between $120,000 and $150,000
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.820]   that rent and the cash flow is unbelievable.
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.620]   They're not affected by the taxes.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:21.100]   They can offer lower rent because they're not paying that 72 percent increase in property
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.100]   tax.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.620]   So, you know, it's a it's a great play.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.580]   We have an unbelievable team there and it works.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.060]   But that doesn't mean you should go running off to Chicago and buy property because there's
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.580]   neighborhoods you need to stay out of.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.220]   We just we have very good teams there that know exactly how to how to do it.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:38.940]   So you know, you've got to real estate is local and you got to know what you're doing
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.100]   and you know, you got to have really good teams.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.940]   Two questions last on my list for you, Kathy.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.500]   You and your family continue living in California.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   Is that right?
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.860]   Yeah, we love paying high taxes.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.660]   It's our favorite.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:02.800]   What is your prediction regarding California real estate prices and why do you continue
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   to live there?
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:09.820]   We have this thing about surfing.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.440]   So we really, really, really like to surf.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.540]   We live two miles from the beach.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.980]   We bought the cheapest and oldest house in Malibu.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.260]   It was cheaper than the house we owned, you know, that I told you about earlier.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.460]   It was, you know, just a dump.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.460]   But we fixed it up.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.460]   We love it.
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.660]   It's our home.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:31.220]   And we have a daughter who, you know, our oldest daughter's already left and gone to
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.340]   college and is now working, like I said.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.460]   But the younger one, we don't we don't want.
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.460]   She loves it, you know.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.540]   So probably what we're going to do is once she's gone, we're going to buy a vacation,
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.900]   not a vacation, but we're going to move to Nevada and buy a property where we can ski
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.900]   in Tahoe.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.740]   And that would be our primary.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.860]   And we would keep the house in Malibu, which would then become our vacation home.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.380]   So basically for taxes.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:59.140]   But what do I think about California real estate?
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.740]   Well, California is California.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:01.740]   Born and raised.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.740]   I know it well.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.740]   Prices go up.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.740]   Prices go down.
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.740]   You can make a million.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.740]   You can lose a million.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.740]   You just need to know what you're doing.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:14.060]   You either need to hold the property forever so you don't care or you need to time it well.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:21.260]   So I'm more about timing because I think you can really make your millions, sell and then,
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.380]   you know, transfer the property somewhere else until the market crashes, come back by
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.380]   then.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:30.100]   So what we're doing is, you know, absolutely 100 percent.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.100]   It's a bubble.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.340]   San Francisco is the most expensive place in the country, more than New York City.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.980]   People can't afford to live there.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.640]   It's not like the Silicon Valley is going to be there forever.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   It's moving.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.940]   You know, there's tech jobs moving all over to Utah, to Austin, to Pittsburgh.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.860]   You know, so to think that this one time in history, prices aren't going to go back down
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.420]   even though they've done it every 10 years, every decade.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.900]   They go up, they go down.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.060]   People forget.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:01.300]   So we're telling everyone who will listen, it's time to sell.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.540]   This is your time to cash in.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:09.140]   Go buy in these other areas like I recommended before and cash, you know, quadruple your
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.500]   cash flow.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.900]   Rent in California if you still want to live there.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:17.780]   Wait till prices crash and then buy back in the market when prices are low.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.420]   So it's already happening.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.460]   It's already softening.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.980]   The high end is already, you know, it's affected.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:29.340]   I mean, the evaluations of these high tech Silicon Valley companies is just ridiculous.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.660]   There's no fundamentals in place.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.800]   So here we are.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.120]   People will listen or they won't.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.940]   How are you protecting yourself with regard to your personal property?
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:45.060]   How are you balancing, yes, we're living here but we also want to protect ourselves financially?
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.420]   Well, that's what I was saying before.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:54.740]   Like if you love where you live and you're not going anywhere, if you're not moving and
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.700]   you can afford your payment, then you have nothing to worry about.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.780]   It's just what you have to worry.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.260]   So like I told you, we bought, it was a $750,000 home in Malibu.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.700]   Now that might sound expensive to other people but in California that's cheap.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.460]   We bought a one bedroom, one bath.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.860]   Our daughter lives, we converted the garage for her room.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.100]   I mean, we're living small.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   It's California.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.100]   It's Malibu.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.940]   You know, the average home price there is like $10 million.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:25.460]   So we've got this little tiny cottage basically but we love it and we're not going anywhere.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.060]   And so we're going to have it forever.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   It doesn't matter.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   We can afford it.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.460]   But for people who come to me who are, and this happens every day, they're in their 50s,
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.420]   they're in their 60s, they're sitting in a dump, they don't love it, they're in a Silicon
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420]   Valley, they're done.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.300]   I just had a guy come to me, he got laid off.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   He's 65.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.580]   He's in the Silicon Valley.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.300]   Well, listen, you're in the most expensive place in the world to live.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.540]   Bad idea if you don't have your retirement in place.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.540]   Sell it.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:01.980]   Take that $500,000 tax free gain and go live an hour outside of the Silicon Valley or somewhere
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.860]   else that's lovely.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.420]   And buy, you know, I'm sitting in Chico, California right now in my daughter's place.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.220]   It's two hours away from the Bay Area.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.560]   You can buy a beautiful home here for $300,000, $200,000.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.540]   So get out of the expensive stuff.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   Get into something you can afford.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.420]   Take that extra money and invest it properly.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.860]   That's what you got to do if you're later in life.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.060]   Don't sit there and think you can live in the most expensive place in the world when
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.580]   you don't have your retirement set up.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.380]   If you do, then good for you.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   Live wherever you want.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.380]   But most people don't.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.780]   - Last question.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.980]   You have almost two things regarding real estate and business.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:49.020]   You have some real estate investments and you have a business.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.580]   Here's my question.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.820]   Which has been better to your family's finances?
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:01.480]   - That's a close one because our business has taken off.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.060]   Last year we literally said, "All right, this is growing too fast.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.360]   We need to slow down.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.740]   Just improve systems.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.180]   Just make our customer service better, our quality better.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:12.040]   Just slow down."
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   And guess what?
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.040]   We didn't even try.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.580]   We're just trying to improve systems.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:22.020]   So we're just at that time in life where everybody gets that real estate's a safe investment
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.900]   and we're very, very busy.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:31.280]   But really just trying to improve every little bit of it, every system we have.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.740]   We did just make it to the Inc. 5,000.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   So we're excited about that.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.300]   One of the fastest growing companies in the U.S. in spite of the fact that we're really
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.100]   just trying to slow down.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:45.300]   So to compare that to our investments, like I said, our very first investment we made
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.180]   a million dollars just living in a house.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:53.220]   So we bought those properties in Texas that 10 of them doubled.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.220]   We've done well.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:56:00.860]   Now we are buying, just to give you an example, we pooled together, I think it was 100 investors
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:07.220]   who each put in $50,000 each and we bought this land in Reno just outside that Tesla
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.700]   plant and bought it from a distressed seller.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.380]   He was on a loan that ballooned.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.380]   Balloon loans are terrible.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.420]   It means you have to come up with a whole payment and if you don't you lose the property.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:21.820]   So the seller was on a balloon because we were the only ones that could come in right
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.340]   away with cash.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.420]   We bought this property for cheap.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:33.180]   By the time we closed we had a national builder come in and ask for half the lots for more
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.200]   than we'd paid for all the lots.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.260]   So now we're sitting on these lots in Reno free and clear.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:47.460]   So I mean probably still our net worth is much higher in our investments.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.020]   But the business is doing well too.
