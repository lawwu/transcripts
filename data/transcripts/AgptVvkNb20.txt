[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   After one quarter of a century at Bethlehem Baptist Church, John Piper looked back and
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.520]   reflected on one of the most troubling trends that he followed in Christianity.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.440]   It was the trend of self-esteem and self-love.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.840]   Big in the 1970s and 1980s, self-esteem was said to be the key to Christian love.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.080]   Love yourself more, then you'll be able to love others more effectively.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200]   But such a model was a distortion.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   Actually, what the Bible demands from Christians is far more radical than self-esteem.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.960]   It's more radical because the Bible does not call us to love ourselves more, but to
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.800]   love others with the same earnestness and zeal that we already love ourselves with.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.200]   This more radical calling to love is such a high and demanding calling.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.920]   Pastor John will come out and call this revelation utterly devastating.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.120]   Because it really renders Christianity to be "an impossible religion."
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.120]   Here's Pastor John to explain in one of his 2005 sermons.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.120]   How is the debt of love we owe to others related to self-love?
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.920]   Verse 9 is a quotation, Romans 13 9, is a quotation of Leviticus 19 18.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920]   It's quoted by Jesus, it's quoted by James, it's quoted by Paul.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.320]   This is the royal law of love.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.160]   You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.360]   And my question is, what does "as you love yourself" mean?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   As yourself?
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.880]   I've been here 25 years now.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.840]   We just celebrated that on Wednesday night.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640]   And I can remember in the six years before I got here being over at Bethel.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:59.560]   And I would say among the dominant concerns of my life from 1974 to 1986, 7, 8, 9 was
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.480]   this issue.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   What does "as yourself" mean?
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.680]   And I point out that little historical fact just because either I've got my head in the
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.080]   sand or things have changed a little bit.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:22.220]   I don't hear as much now as I did 30 and 20 years ago the psychological scheme that was
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.560]   built on this verse that was so wrong.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.800]   But I'm going to tell you what it is just in case my head is in the sand and just in
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.080]   case it's got a hook in you in a second or third generation.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.680]   I'm going to try to get the hook out right now.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.280]   For many years, people, Christians, would write articles and books in which they said
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.000]   that this command meant that the reason people don't love others is because they haven't
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.480]   learned to love themselves enough.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.000]   And therefore, the task of counseling and the task of education and parenting and preaching
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.160]   is to help people love themselves more so that they would have resources to love other
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400]   people.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.360]   And in that little scheme, self-love always meant self-esteem.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.760]   So the universal gospel that fixes all problems of children and marriages and business conflict
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.640]   is lack of self-esteem.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.320]   And therefore, the task of all counselors, all preachers, all parents, all educators
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.160]   is get more self-esteem into these little kids' lives and into these employees' lives,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.320]   and then things will go better because as they love themselves, they will spill over
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.740]   on love to other people.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.520]   That was the scheme, and it colossally missed the point in several ways.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.200]   First, this biblical commandment assumes that all of us love each other and don't need to
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.880]   be taught at all to love each other.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   It is an assumption.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.560]   Every person in this room, without exception, has a massive love affair with yourself.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.280]   You don't need to be taught at all, and it has, secondly, nothing to do with self-esteem.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.840]   Your love for yourself is very simply your desire to be happy and to do whatever it takes
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.040]   to make your life the way you want it.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.360]   He's not talking about first you learn to esteem yourself, and then out of that rich
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.160]   appreciation for your qualities, you now are free to love other people, which presumably
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   then would mean to help them appreciate how wonderful they are.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.760]   That's just not the way Paul is thinking.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.560]   The words are not a command to love yourself.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160]   They are an assumption.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.960]   Love your neighbor as you already love yourself, no questions asked about it.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   Here's an example.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   Ephesians 5, I'll just read it to you.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.080]   What Paul is doing in Ephesians 5 is husbands and wives, right?
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.140]   And in husbands and wives, he's taking the command to love your neighbor and applying
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.600]   it to husbands and wives.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.400]   Isn't it great?
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.000]   So how does a husband love a wife in these terms?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And it goes like this, verse 28 of Ephesians 5, "Husbands should love their wives as their
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.960]   own bodies.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.760]   He who loves his wife loves himself."
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.560]   And then he adds this amazingly crucial statement in verse 29, "For no one ever hated his own
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.520]   flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does."
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.160]   The church.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.760]   Nobody ever hated himself, but nourishes and cherishes himself.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:09.840]   Everybody without exception loves himself, whatever his self-esteem is, high or low.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:19.140]   Everybody wants food to eat and will do almost anything to get it if we get hungry enough.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.600]   Everybody wants to drink and not die of thirst, and we will do almost anything to serve ourselves
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   with drink if we get thirsty enough.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.200]   Everybody wants to avoid injury and death, and we will do whatever it takes not to walk
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:45.520]   in front of a train or a truck or drink poison or get ourselves killed in some other way.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   We love life and our health big time.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:58.240]   And if somebody raises the objection, "Well, what about masochists and suicide victims?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   Are they exceptions?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.440]   I mean, they don't treat themselves well, do they?"
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.920]   The answer is that masochists and suicide victims are not exceptions to this rule.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.640]   A masochist is a person who, for very sad and sick reasons, finds pleasure in hurting
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   himself or pleasure in the tending of the doctors.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   I've talked to these people who cut themselves.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   And I asked one young woman we were working with, "Why do you cut yourself?"
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.280]   Big lacerations on her stomach.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.060]   And she said, "It's the only time anybody ever touches me."
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.060]   She wanted to be touched.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.060]   She loved herself massively.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.480]   "Touch me.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.520]   Touch me, doctors."
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.700]   Same thing with suicide.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.540]   The only reason people commit suicide is because life has gotten so painful they can't stand
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.360]   it anymore, and they want to escape.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.880]   They just want out of the pain, which is self-love.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.560]   I don't want the pain anymore.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.960]   Everybody likes to be praised.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:22.080]   And apart from grace, we all subtly say things and do things to be liked, to be praised.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   Takes a massive work of divine grace to free you from that idol.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.980]   We love the praise of men.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.400]   Everyone has self-love.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.980]   Jesus does not command it.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.280]   He assumes it.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:46.360]   Now, lots of people think it would be very radical if Jesus said, "So stop loving yourself
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.600]   like that and start doing the duty of love to other people.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   Stop having those strong cravings for your own happiness and your own welfare.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   Stop that.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   Kill that.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   Crucify that.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.360]   And start doing something that doesn't flow from desires for your happiness and just do
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.000]   dutiful loving things."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   Some people would say that's really radical.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.120]   And it would be, I suppose, but it's not as radical as what Jesus says and Paul says and
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.680]   James says and Leviticus says.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:36.600]   They say, "Love your neighbor that way, that way, like you massively love yourself.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   Make your desire to be alive.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.960]   Make your desire for happiness the measure of your desire for other people's happiness."
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.920]   You talk about radical.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   You talk about life-changing, heart-exploding, impossible demands.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   Love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.420]   If you are energetic in pursuing your own happiness, be energetic in pursuing the happiness
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.880]   of your neighbor.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.600]   If you are creative in pursuing your own happiness, be creative in pursuing the happiness of your
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   neighbor.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.880]   If you are persevering and enduring in pursuing your own happiness, be persevering and enduring.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.280]   Be enduring in pursuing the happiness of your neighbor.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:33.600]   Paul is not mainly saying, "Seek for your neighbor the same things that you want."
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.960]   He's saying, "Seek their good in the same way that you seek your own good."
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:49.440]   Make the degree of your own self-seeking, which is very high, the measure of your seeking
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.680]   their good.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   This is devastating.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.440]   You're sitting at home.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.920]   You're just enjoying an evening.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   Feels good.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.840]   Watching television, watching a video, eating a good meal, talking, and you hear Jesus say,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.400]   "Love your neighbor as you want this evening."
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.960]   It's just devastating.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.600]   Measure your pursuit of the happiness of others by the pursuit of your own.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.480]   How do you pursue your well-being?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.760]   Pursue their well-being that way.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.440]   Are you hungry?
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.740]   Find a hungry neighbor and feed him.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.040]   Are you thirsty?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.840]   Give your thirsty neighbor a drink.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.200]   Are you lonely?
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.220]   Find someone who's lonely and befriend them.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.920]   Are you frightened?
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.080]   Send someone to comfort.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.920]   You want to make a good grade on the next exam.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   So do others.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.600]   Help them.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   That is radical.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.820]   It's far more radical than saying, "Stop desiring and start doing duty."
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:04.400]   It's far more radical because it says, "Now, all these massive desires that I have for
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.540]   my happiness are not sent away.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.480]   They are transposed into another kind of music."
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   The same energy, the same longings, the same desires are now desires for you and your salvation
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   and your happiness and your good, your stomach being full, your mind being educated, and
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.560]   your life having significance.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:38.460]   All the things I want, I now, with that same energy, want for you.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.500]   Christianity is an impossible religion.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:53.060]   This is a standard that is overwhelming, and it just makes me long to have a miracle done
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   to me.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.060]   Amen.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.940]   I had to listen to this clip twice to fully understand Pastor John's point, and I'm glad
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   I did.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.540]   The very high calling, the impossibly high calling of Christian love.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   Incredible.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.940]   This was pulled from his sermon on Romans 13, verses 8 to 10, titled "Love is a Fulfilling
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.480]   of the Law, Part 2," preached on July 31st, 2005.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.980]   You can get the entire audio recording at DesiringGod.org right now.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.340]   Well, if you have a great Piper sermon clip, email me.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.820]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.980]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   That's our email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
