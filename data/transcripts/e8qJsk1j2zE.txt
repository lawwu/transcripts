[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.980]   You wrote a post about levels of lucidity. Quote, as we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually accumulating ideas about itself.

[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.360]   but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages. So, there's seven of the stages.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.440]   but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages. So, there's seven of the stages.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:54.640]   Stage one, reactive survival infant. Stage two, personal self, young child. Stage three, social self, adolescence, domesticated adult. Stage four is rational agency, self-direction. Stage five is self-authoring. That's full adult. You've achieved wisdom, but there's two more stages. Stage six is enlightenment, self-reflection, and self-adultery.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   That's full adult. You've achieved wisdom, but there's two more stages.

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   stage six is enlightenment, stage seven is transcendence. Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages? What's your sense why there are stages of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short life?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.640]   This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan. He talks about the development of the self as a process that happens in the process of self-reflection.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:35.200]   In principle, by some kind of reverse engineering of the mind, where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself.

[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:54.640]   I found myself using this model not so much as a developmental model. I'm not even sure if it's a very good developmental model because I saw my children not progressing exactly like that. I also suspect that you don't go through these stages necessarily in succession, and it's not that you work through one stage and then you get into the next one, and you're not that successful in the next one. I also suspect that you don't go through these stages necessarily in succession, and it's not that you work through one stage and then you get into the next one,

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:54.640]   In some sense, you could compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or social colors and sounds. People are all not physical objects. They are creation of our mind at a certain level of coarse grainy models that are mathematical, that use geometry, that use manipulation of objects and so on to be able to do this kind of work.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:24.640]   a great thing in which we can find ourselves and interact with them. So Minecraft, yeah, and this personal stuff is something that is more or less created after the world is finished after it's trained into the system after it has been constructed and this personal stuff is an agent that interacts with the outside world. And the outside world is not the world of quantum mechanics, not the physical universe, but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   The outside world is not the world of quantum mechanics, not the physical universe, but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.680]   And this is us. And we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.980]   that is created outside of our own mind.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.920]   And outside of ourself, there are feelings,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.680]   and they presented our interface with this outside world.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.560]   They pose problems to us.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.340]   These feelings are basically attitudes
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.060]   that our mind is computing that tell us what's needed in the world,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.720]   the things that we are drawn to,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.640]   the things that we are afraid of.

[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   It takes a long time to figure out and it's okay to be different. In fact, it's beautiful to be different.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:34.980]   You know, I think that's what I was thinking when I was growing up. That I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that I could belong.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:11:03.160]  , but I felt that in my twenties I had lots of friends and I had my place in the world and I had no longer doubts that I would never be alone again.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.660]   Is there some aspect to which we're alone together? You don't see a deep loneliness inside you?
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:33.840]  , sorry.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:07.260]   To a large degree. What was the trick?
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260]   In many ways growing up and paying attention. Meditation did help. I had some very crucial experiences in getting close to people, building connections, cuddling a lot in my student years.

[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   So, really paying attention to the, what is it, to the feeling another human being fully.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   And loving other people and being loved by other people.

[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   Over time basically at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that I feel blocked out.

[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:24.700]  , but I feel connected and I experience where somebody else is at.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   Normally my mind is racing very fast at a high frequency. So, it's not always working like this. Sometimes it works better, sometimes it works less. But also don't see this as a pressure. It's more, it's interesting to observe myself on which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at. Yeah, man, the mind is so beautiful in that way. Sometimes it comes so natural to me. So, even if I'm not in the right place, I'm not in the right place.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   It's easy to pay attention, pay attention to the world fully, to other people fully. And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming. It's so interesting to demise that rollercoaster in that way.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   It's easy to pay attention, pay attention to the world fully, to other people fully. And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming. It's so interesting to demise that rollercoaster in that way.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed. Self-offer.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   You realize that your values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving a world that you like and aesthetics that you prefer.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   The more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your identity is constructed.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   So, the more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your identity is constructed
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   a little more you get agency over how your identity is constructed
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   a little bit more easily,
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:24.740]   a little bit more easily,
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:24.740]   and you realize that identity and interpersonal interaction is a costume. And you should be able to have agency over that costume. It's useful to be a costume. It tells something to others and it allows to interface and roles. But being locked into this is a big limitation. The word costume kind of implies that it's fraudulent in some way. Is costume a good word for you? No. Like we present ourselves to the world. In some sense I learned a lot about costumes because I'm not a good person.

[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.760]   somebody and you become empathetic with them what happens that is that you go

[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.040]   into a resonance state system right similar to when people go into a

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.200]   integrating over all these signals you can make inferences about the state of

And so I had to learn and I for me Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:47.560]   I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness works, I was quite optimistic. I thought I need to need to be a big body of knowledge that I can just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science, and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found because I found that the questions of how consciousness and so on works, how emotion works, how it's possible that the system can experience anything, and I was disappointed by what I found because I found that the questions of how consciousness and so on works, how emotion works, how it's possible that the system can experience anything,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:46:17.140]  , how motivation emerges in the mind, were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that were around. And instead, I found that with individual thinkers that had useful ideas that sometimes were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group of people, sometimes were rejected by large groups of people, but for me it was much more interesting to see these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking about the mind as a whole,

[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   It's a very basic question when you read a theory that you find convincing or interesting. How do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources of that other person, not which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of being truthful. But how does this authority in turn know? What is the epistemic chain to observable solutions?

[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   What is the epistemic chain to observable solutions?
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:43.820]   - Yes.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:43.820]   - Yes.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:50:13.840]   - Yes.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:51:13.880]   'Cause I'm not sure if I'm not saying it right now. But I think that's a good question.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   - Yes. - I think that's a good question.

[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:15.920]   the distinction between the individuals that throw that away. So what does this interaction representations look like?
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.180]   - When you think about how you represent the interaction of us and this room, at some level, the modalities are quite distinct.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:28.920]   They're not completely distinct, but you can see this as vision, you can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore,
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.720]   but you still imagine that you can see this as a vision, you can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore, but you still imagine that you can see a lot,
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:35.060]   and you can imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.060]   And you know that it's very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes,
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.540]   And you know that it's very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes,
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.360]   and you get back into this shared merge space.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.360]   And we also have these experiments that we noticed that the way in which my lips are moving are affecting how you hear the sound,
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.700]   And we also have these experiments that we noticed that the way in which my lips are moving are affecting how you hear the sound,
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing have an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.660]   And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing have an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.940]   And so these modalities are not separate in the way that you're hearing the sound.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   And your own interactions in the scene are also not completely separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   But there is some resonance that is going on, where we also have a degree of shared mental representations and shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between the two.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   And so these modalities are not separate in your mind, they are merged at some fundamental level where you are interpreting the entire scene that you're in.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   And your own interactions in the scene are also not completely separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene,

[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.160]   I wonder if self-improving AGI
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.720]   might end up saturating physical environments
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.440]   with intelligence to such a degree
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.900]   that isolation of individual mental states
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.380]   becomes almost impossible
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.220]   and the representations of all complex
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.340]   self-organizing agents merge permanently
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.780]   with each other.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.840]   So that's a really interesting idea.

[01:00:40.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   I think that the end game of AGI

[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:02.480]   and so on. So if you combine this with the notion that systems are physically interacting to the point where their representations are merging and interacting with each other, you would literally implement something like this. It would still be a representational state, you would not be one with physics itself, it would still be coarse-grained, it would still be much slower than physics itself.

[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:31.340]   It would still be coarse-grained, it would still be much slower than physics itself. But it would be a representation in which you become aware that you're part of some kind of global information processing system, like thought and a global mind. And a conscious thought that coexisting with many other self-reflective thoughts.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:31.420]   It would still be coarse-grained, it would still be much slower than physics itself. But I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.
