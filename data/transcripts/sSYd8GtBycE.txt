[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Well, in our fight against sin, do we focus our attention on Christ or do we focus our
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.560]   attention on ourselves?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.680]   It's a very tangible question today from a listener.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.600]   My name is Matthew, a Christian college student in Colorado.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.480]   I just listened to the recent episode, 'Fight Sin Like a Victor, Not a Victim'"—that's
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.600]   APJ 1559—"and it brought up a question for me that I've been struggling with for
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.920]   the past few years.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.800]   In that episode, you say, and I'm paraphrasing, that having the verdict of not guilty on the
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.020]   basis of Christ's sacrifice on my behalf is the key to overcoming sin.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.360]   From books like James and 1 John, I also see that obedience to God is the necessary evidence
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.880]   that we have saving faith.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.900]   There is a great confusion for me with these two truths.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.760]   This confusion keeps me from joy and gets my eyes on myself instead of Christ.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.920]   The following question is the source of my confusion.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.760]   How can I rest in being justified if I need obedience as the evidence to truly know that
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.720]   I am justified?
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.320]   In other words, how can I rest in the verdict of not guilty if in reality the verdict could
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.460]   be guilty unless I see obedience in my life?
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.200]   This circular reasoning inevitably puts the focus back on myself instead of Christ, the
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.760]   opposite of what it is intended to do.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.480]   I am almost sure that I'm thinking about this the wrong way, but Pastor John, would
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   you please help me see how I am misapplying these truths?
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   Let me begin by affirming Matthew's dilemma and then suggest a new angle on the problem
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.800]   that might help.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   Matthew's dilemma is this.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   On the one hand, the New Testament is wonderfully clear that our permanent and full acceptance
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:04.160]   into God's eternal fellowship of joy is based on the blood and righteousness of Jesus,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.480]   whose death on the cross is counted as our punishment and whose obedience is counted
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.920]   as our righteousness.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   So when God looks at us in union with Jesus Christ by faith, he reckons us to be free
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.280]   of guilt and full of righteousness.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.800]   That's amazing.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.600]   So for example, Paul says in Romans 8, 3, "By sending his own Son in the likeness
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.360]   of sinful flesh and for sin, God condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:50.840]   In other words, in his own crucified flesh, Christ received from God our condemnation
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.880]   for sin, so that Paul says two verses earlier, "There is no condemnation for those who
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.440]   are in Christ Jesus."
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.960]   It's all on Jesus, or as Galatians 3, 13 says, "Christ became a curse for us."
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.120]   So we aren't cursed anymore in him.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:24.240]   We enjoy this forgiven, guilt-free, no condemnation, standing before God because of our union with
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.440]   Christ through faith.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.560]   Through faith—I say it again, through faith, not through works—God creates faith in us
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:44.840]   and unites us to Christ through that faith so that what he endured on the cross counts
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   for us.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   Here's the way Paul said it in Ephesians 2, 8, "By grace you have been saved through
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840]   faith.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.040]   This is not your own doing.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.080]   It is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.640]   For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works."
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:22.680]   So that's one horn of Matthew's dilemma—saved by grace alone, through faith alone, on the
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.000]   basis of Christ's righteousness alone.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   Now here's the other horn of his dilemma, and we just saw it in Ephesians 2, 10.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   Even though we are put in a right relationship with God, not as a result of good works, nevertheless
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:50.360]   we are in a right relationship with God for good works, in order to do good works.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.080]   And these good works, this new way of life in love and holiness, is not just an opportunity,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.200]   it is a necessity.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   That's Matthew's dilemma.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:13.640]   He feels a tension between the finished justification and the necessary sanctification.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:24.320]   A new life of holiness is necessary evidence, necessary confirmation that we are in fact
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.500]   saved, born again, new creatures in Christ, justified.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:37.760]   Our new transformed life of obedience is not the ground of our justification, it is the
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.120]   result of it.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:51.040]   Obedience is not the root of faith and salvation, but the fruit of faith and our regeneration,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.800]   our justification.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.120]   Jesus said, "You can know the tree by its fruit.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.540]   The bad fruit shows a bad tree.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.640]   The fruit doesn't make the tree healthy, it shows whether the tree is healthy."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.880]   That's the way Jesus talked about this.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:17.480]   So for example, in Hebrews 12, 14, it says, "Pursue holiness," that is, pursue sanctification,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.400]   "without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.160]   It's necessary.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.640]   This sanctification is necessary to see the Lord.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:37.000]   Or 2 Peter 1.10 says, "Be diligent to confirm your calling and election."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.640]   You don't create your calling by your diligence, you confirm your calling by your diligence
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.800]   in good deeds.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.500]   So Matthew is asking, "How can I rest in my forgiveness and justification and acceptance
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:05.320]   with God when I know I must obey and pursue holiness in order to confirm that I'm accepted?"
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.240]   Isn't the pursuit of obedience, he wonders, the opposite of resting in Christ's obedience
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   for me?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.880]   I'm going to say that again, because that's a paradox lots of us wrestle with, and the
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.920]   Bible wrestles with us.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.840]   Isn't the pursuit of obedience the opposite of resting in Christ's obedience for me?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   And the answer is no, it's not.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.420]   It is not.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.960]   They are not opposites.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.880]   They are not in conflict.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   They go together.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.080]   Now here's my new angle that may help feel that, feel the coherence and have peace about
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   it.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.480]   Here's the new angle that I want to suggest for Matthew to consider, or all of us to consider.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   For sure, Matthew's right to emphasize resting in Christ's finished work as the foundation
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.840]   of our acceptance with God and as fountain of all our obedience.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.440]   But here's what's missing in that correct emphasis.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:19.280]   Christ's past payment for our eternal life is not the only sovereign act that God performs
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.760]   to get us to heaven.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:29.320]   Our security, the certainty that we're going to get there is achieved not only by the infallible
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:38.200]   work of Christ's sacrifice, but also by the infallible work of his spirit in us to make
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   us holy.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.040]   That's an infallible work bought by Jesus.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:50.400]   Another way to say it is that what Christ secured for us on the cross is not just pardon
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   for sins, but God's power to break the bondage to sinning.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.360]   The blood of Jesus is the blood of the new covenant.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.160]   That's what Jesus said in Luke 22, verse 20.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.760]   This is my blood of the new covenant.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   And the promise of the new covenant is not only I will remember their sin no more, but
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:26.160]   also I will put my spirit within them and cause them to walk in my ways.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.400]   Christ's blood bought and secured and guaranteed that.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:40.200]   Or to put it yet another way, when we think about resting in the work of Jesus to save
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:48.520]   us, we should think about what it means to rest not only in his past work of justification,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.680]   but also his daily and future work of sanctification.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   God's commitment to sanctify his elect is just as sure as his commitment to justify
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   his elect.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.000]   That's why Paul says in Romans 8, 30, "Those whom he justified, he glorified," because
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.920]   glorification is the completion of our sanctification.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.040]   Sanctification is a process.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.720]   It ends with glorification.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.080]   It is guaranteed for everybody who is justified.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.280]   No one who is justified will fail to be sanctified.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:33.640]   So perhaps it may help if Matthew and all of us meditate on and rest in promises like
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.520]   these because they're blood bought promises.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:44.880]   The God of peace who brought Jesus alive from the dead will work in us that which is pleasing
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.240]   in his sight through Jesus Christ, Hebrews 13, 21.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   Or God is at work in us to will and to do his good pleasure, Philippians 2, 13.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   Or I am sure that he who began a good work in you will complete it for the day of Christ,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.560]   Philippians 1, 6.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   Or may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   He who calls you is faithful, he will surely do it, 1 Thessalonians 5, 23 and 24.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.800]   Those we called, in other words, he sanctified.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   It is done.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.520]   He is going to do it.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:33.960]   In other words, instead of thinking, "Christ died to secure my justification, and now I
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:43.640]   have to work to confirm my justification," rather think like this, "Christ died to make
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   my justification absolutely certain, and Christ died to make my sanctification absolutely
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   certain.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:06.240]   Therefore, my resting in Christ and his work is not just a past-oriented resting in tension
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:16.540]   with my work, but rather it is a past and present and future-oriented resting precisely
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:25.800]   in his absolutely certain sanctifying work as well as his justifying work."
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.200]   I read a whole book called "Future Grace" on this, and the point was simply this.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:42.360]   It is a glorious thing that the past grace of blood-bought justification is the guarantee
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.560]   of the future grace that will get us home to heaven through sanctification.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the follow-up question, Matthew, and thank
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.160]   you for listening.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.960]   You can ask a question, search or browse all 1,600 of our past episodes or subscribe to
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.200]   the podcast.

[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.340]   When Romans 8:30, the Apostle Paul gives us what has been called the golden chain of redemption,
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.840]   God predestines us in order to call us, and he calls us in order to justify us, and he
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.480]   justifies us in order to glorify us.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.440]   It's an amazing chain of grace, but if we stop here, we behold some amazing works of
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   God in our lives, but we miss the 35-carat diamond that hangs from this golden chain.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.800]   It's the question, why?
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.120]   Why are we saved?
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.760]   It is absolutely essential.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.720]   You must understand this point, and we're going to address it next time on Wednesday
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.320]   when we return.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   Thanks for listening.
