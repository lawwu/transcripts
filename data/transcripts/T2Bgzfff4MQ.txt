[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   We'll get through a lot here.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.160]   I wanna start with a brief news reaction.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.360]   As usual, I'm less interested in the details of the news
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   as much as using this as a hook to get into a,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.660]   maybe a slightly larger discussion of some bigger points
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.160]   going on with tech and culture.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.800]   But I wanted to start with an article
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   that a listener sent me that came from Pew Research.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.600]   All right, so it's an article, this is from June 27,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.320]   so quite recent for those who are watching on YouTube,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   youtube.com/CaliforniaReportMedia.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.840]   You can see the article,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   those who are listening at home, I'll narrate it.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.760]   The title of this article is
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.120]   "Twitter is the Go-To Social Media Site for US Journalists,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.560]   "but Not for the Public."
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.380]   And if we look at it, it's based off of a survey.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.280]   So a recent Pew Research Center survey
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.440]   of people from the news industry.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.840]   So we have reporters, editors,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.960]   and others working in the news industry.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620]   I wanna hone in on one particular chart,
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.600]   which you should be seeing, I'm gonna scroll this up now.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.760]   There we go.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.000]   So you should be seeing this chart
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.020]   if you're watching online.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.160]   Basically, if you're listening, here's what it is.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.320]   It's two bar graphs.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.600]   On the left, it shows for each of these common
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   social media style sites,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.920]   what percentage of US journalists say they use that
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040]   most or second most in their job.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.240]   And then on the right, it is what percentage of US adults
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.640]   say they use that platform,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.840]   particular platform regularly to get news.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.200]   So we're comparing the platforms that journalists
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.280]   use regularly, when their top two sites
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.000]   they use in their job versus the websites
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.140]   that the average US adult uses to get news.
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.620]   That's the comparison being shown here.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.600]   Left is journalist, right is adults.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.680]   The big thing you'll notice,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.800]   and this is from the headline,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.000]   is that for the journalist, Twitter dominates.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   69% of the journalists surveyed say Twitter
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   is their top one or two platforms they use for their job.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.240]   You look next to it, you look at US adults,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.760]   and you see Twitter is 13%.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.640]   13% regularly use that to get news.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.420]   So there is a major difference between the digital world
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900]   in which journalists live versus the digital world
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.540]   in which most US adults live.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.280]   Journalists are very Twitter focused.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.660]   That is where they find news.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.820]   That is where news is discussed.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.760]   The average American adult is not.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.060]   Now this matters for a couple of reasons.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.060]   One, as we've covered numerous times on this show,
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.640]   there is a real effect, a real filter effect
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.940]   of what you see and how it is portrayed
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.000]   based on the particular platform you look at.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.380]   So Twitter creates its own ecosystem
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.420]   of what's important and what's not important.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.460]   How we should feel about this,
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.580]   how we shouldn't feel about this.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.820]   And it's a very emotionally salient ecosystem.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.700]   So it not only pushes things to the forefront
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.540]   as being important,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.180]   but it does so with great emotional gusto.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.820]   So if you're a journalist who lives in this world,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.420]   you are being exposed to these huge,
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.780]   seemingly huge upswellings of emotion and commitment
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.660]   and engagement and activism,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.100]   which may actually be largely artifice
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.440]   or at the very least, largely separate
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.220]   from what the population as a whole believes.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.260]   This is why, as we covered in previous shows,
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.120]   we're beginning to see some of the major news companies
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.700]   pushing their staff away from Twitter
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.140]   because of this effect.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.380]   New York Times being the most prominent example
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.340]   of them telling their reporters,
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.900]   please stop using Twitter.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.380]   This is not helping the quality of our reporting.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.720]   The other issue with Twitter,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.880]   it's not captured directly,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.260]   but it's implied by this graph,
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.060]   is that the reaction to what you do
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.360]   as an individual who posts on Twitter can be quite strong.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.780]   We talked about this in a previous episode.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.500]   Feedback is something we're wired to take seriously.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.780]   So if you're a journalist who uses Twitter
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.700]   as your primary tool, like 69% of US journalists do,
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.820]   you're constantly working with this digital
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.540]   sword of Damocles hanging over your head.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.500]   What if I say the wrong thing
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.980]   and really upset the crowd on Twitter?
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.740]   What if I miss out a particular caveat
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.380]   or don't mention this other factor that could be happening
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.740]   and I really get swarmed on by other people?
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.220]   This is anxiety producing.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.100]   This is nerve wracking,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.640]   and it really can push coverage in certain directions.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.500]   Certain issues are never talked about
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.700]   or other issues are drowned
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.940]   in all sorts of defensive maneuvering.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.660]   So there is all of these negative side effects,
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.340]   both what you see and how you worry about people seeing you
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.000]   if Twitter is the main thing you use.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.580]   Most people don't use it.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.780]   Journalists do, so it's an interesting separation.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.660]   There is, however, something new I wanna remark about,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.420]   new to this show, that I think is significant.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.920]   And I don't quite understand this well,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.100]   but I wanna put a preliminary stake in the ground here.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.260]   Let's look at the right side of this chart.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.340]   So the sites that US adults in general use to get news.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.300]   Look at number two.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.860]   YouTube.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.780]   It's the second most used site by US adults to obtain news.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.440]   So what's going on with that?
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.120]   Well, I think what this might be reflecting is generational.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.620]   There is, I think, for the younger adult generations,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.060]   what I guess you might call Gen Z
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.140]   and the younger millennials,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.920]   a shift towards YouTube being a replacement
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.900]   for what my generation would have used cable for.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.300]   That YouTube has become your source
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   of television style entertainment.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.940]   And so why are you getting a lot of news from YouTube?
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.900]   Because that's where I watch shows,
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.900]   putting quotation marks around them,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.300]   'cause they look very different than they did before.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.420]   But if I want news, maybe I'm looking at breaking points
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.160]   or Kyle Kalinske, or if I'm on the other side
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.020]   of the political spectrum, Ben Shapiro or what have you.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.460]   But this is actually where I think a whole generation
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.460]   is going for relatively reasonably produced video content.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.100]   Now, I think this is really significant.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.140]   I think it's really significant
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.860]   because it is a different game than is being played
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.300]   by the real flashy players
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.940]   in the online digital attention economy.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.780]   We're looking now at the war between TikTok and Facebook,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.220]   and there's Instagram and there's Twitter.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.380]   And these are the platforms
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.900]   that are getting a lot of attention now.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.920]   But they're playing a different game.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   Those platforms are playing what I think of
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   as being the more short-term game
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   of how do we get maximum engagement from people today?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   How do we get you to put your eyeballs
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.680]   on this app as long as possible?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.400]   And so Facebook adds this feature
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.240]   and then TikTok tries something different
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   and then Instagram tries to pivot
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.640]   and let's try to use reels here to be more TikTok like.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.960]   And it's just fighting short-term
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.560]   to get people to glue their eyes to these screens.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.280]   And they're using user generated content.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.400]   Most of it's not super high quality, fine.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.000]   YouTube, I think, is playing a longer game.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.580]   It is looking at what happened when the web came along
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.360]   and it completely disrupted and democratized
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.460]   the production and publication of text.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.920]   You used to have to be a newspaper or a magazine
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.640]   or a book publisher to have any sort
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.060]   of mass audience for text.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.140]   The web said anyone could do this now.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.040]   YouTube is doing this with video.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.240]   And I think it's a really important shift.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   It's going to change long-term how we consume
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   and produce video content away from the TV
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.700]   and towards these new sort of mediums
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.900]   that YouTube is experimenting with.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.580]   And I don't think the game is,
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.060]   how do I do this addictive TikTok style experience
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.980]   that's going to get you glued to this as much as possible?
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.580]   I mean, maybe they care about that in the short term,
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.000]   but the long-term impact, I think,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.440]   of democratizing video is going to be
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.260]   a complete change of that landscape.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.500]   So we see hints of that in 22% of US adults
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.180]   getting their news from YouTube.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.300]   That's because YouTube is their TV.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.520]   That is their cable TV.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.860]   They don't go to CNN.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.800]   They go to a YouTube channel of someone they trust.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.900]   They want to know about, let's say, the latest COVID news.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.980]   Instead of going to Fox News or MSNBC,
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.700]   they will switch to something like
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.220]   John Campbell's YouTube page.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.900]   A former nurse, an instructor of nurse
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.860]   who has a YouTube page where every other day,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.040]   or maybe even every day, he literally just takes
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.740]   the statistics of what's going on in UK in particular
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.220]   with COVID numbers, and he goes through them,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.780]   and the camera shows him the paper,
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.380]   and he just ticks things off with his pen,
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.560]   and just let's go through the numbers
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.540]   and see what's happening, 2.5 million subscribers.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.380]   You get more people watching those videos
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.300]   than are watching the morning show on CNN.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.280]   So this, I think, is interesting.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.500]   And where is this all going to lead?
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.660]   Well, I honestly think the red herring in this conversation,
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.060]   the red herring is the highly engaging,
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.980]   addictive TikTok style, user-generated,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.260]   go straight into my brainstem type,
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.980]   quick, quick, 15-second content.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.980]   What I think is going to emerge from the YouTube world
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.500]   is this medium-level production value.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.420]   Like, I think this is what's gonna be important.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.980]   This is what is gonna disrupt the television,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.540]   in particular, the cable television landscape,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.820]   which is hundreds of billions of dollars of economy.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.960]   What's gonna disrupt this is people creating videos,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.240]   but not creating videos quickly with their phone
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.940]   to go to TikTok, but people who have some production value.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.500]   That they have a set, they have some good lights,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.340]   they have some people working on it.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.060]   It's still a fraction of the cost
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.260]   of producing a half hour
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.580]   of standard terrestrial linear cable programming,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.700]   but it's good enough production values.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.220]   We saw that happen in the blogging revolution.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.740]   It was individual bloggers that gave way
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.900]   towards content sites.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.560]   You get the, like, BuzzFeeds and the Slates and the Vox
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.220]   that actually were replicating newspaper magazine quality,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.620]   but at a fraction of the production cost.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.620]   We're seeing that in audio.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.780]   What's happening in podcast?
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.340]   We're seeing this large industry eating into
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.220]   and about the Conquer radio,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.580]   but what are the shows that are doing this?
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.740]   Well, they have radio-style production values.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.780]   I mean, there's a reason why we're in this studio,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.540]   why we have all this equipment over here.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.100]   It's a lot cheaper than running an NPR affiliate,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.220]   but it's when you cross that uncanny valley
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.320]   into production values
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.060]   that are close enough to professional.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.180]   That's when these democratized channels
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.660]   for media production become important,
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.460]   and that, I think, is the important thing
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.780]   happening in YouTube.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.820]   It's not my picture I took with my smartphone,
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.180]   but the breaking point set
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.180]   where they have a pretty good lighting grid,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.180]   and they're using a $60,000 4K camera,
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.020]   three-camera system with a TriCaster
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.260]   so that you can actually display their show
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.860]   on a 4K large-screen television,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.440]   and it looks the same resolution style
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.620]   as what's coming out of the TV studios.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.300]   $60,000 is a lot,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.100]   but it's a fraction of what it pays to do,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.700]   costs to do a traditional cable show.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.780]   So anyways, there's this underlying trend
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.300]   I think is important.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.420]   YouTube is becoming the new TV for a bigger generation.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.260]   This is driving a crossing of the uncanny valley.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.660]   More and more democratically distributedly produced
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.900]   video content is beginning to approximate
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.020]   the production values of low-end television.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.760]   That, I think, those are the moves I think
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.300]   that really disrupt the media landscape.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.340]   So there's the whole engagement war
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.740]   happening with social media platforms.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.100]   Let's put that aside for now.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.580]   This, I think, is a trend that is also,
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.920]   it's also worth keeping an eye on.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.500]   I mean, Jesse, that's why we're doing video.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.060]   I don't really know, we don't really know
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.860]   what exactly we're trying to accomplish
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.100]   by having the reasonably lit studio,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.300]   a pretty good camera system, you know, some good audio.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.220]   But as you heard me say all along,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.180]   is I just had this instinct, I think we should be there.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.540]   I think things are happening.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.940]   I can't tell you, I can't point to,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.900]   oh, we're trying to do X, what this person's doing,
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.160]   and we can be there in six months.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.960]   But I think a couple years from now,
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.860]   there's some importance to being early on this.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.000]   - It's the same deal that you talked about originally
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.300]   when you provided the justification for the YouTube channel
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.300]   and having your core ideas, those types of,
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.100]   like your reading lists, like you can get specific content
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.740]   where you went to the podcast and go to minute 32,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.700]   whatever, to see Cal talk about books,
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.000]   whereas now you can just send him the video.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.140]   It's like easy, they can watch it on their phone.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.180]   - You can share, yeah, and there's something about visual.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.660]   Like why do people watch video of podcasts?
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.220]   I had this conversation with a friend of mine,
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.220]   we went out to lunch, and he's my age.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.460]   So he's like, I don't understand
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.860]   why anyone would have a video of a podcast.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.500]   He's like, when are people, when are they listening to it?
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.180]   And I was like, no, people like to watch it.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.740]   - It's funny, I actually figured out when they do,
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.140]   one of my buddies, Eitan, who I hadn't seen in a while,
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.740]   he watches it in the gym.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.820]   So he has it on the gym and then he, like on a big TV,
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.380]   and then, 'cause he sent me a picture,
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.220]   he's like, is that you?
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.140]   And I was like, it is me.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.740]   So then he watches it when he works out.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.580]   I think a lot of people do that.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.940]   - Which is like people used to put TV on, so why not?
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.180]   I think the sports radio people figured that out, right?
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.740]   Especially like the early, like Dan Patrick, Colin Coward,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.420]   like they figured out people like to see you,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.980]   even if it's just they're in their studio
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.820]   with their fancy mic and they're just sitting there talking,
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.660]   something about it is just, that was really compelling.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.460]   There's the, you know, the sports junkies
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.260]   is a morning sports show here in DC.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.220]   They have, they're now televised
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.100]   on the NBC sports network, right?
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.300]   It's just four guys around the table talking,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.180]   but that is like compelling television.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.260]   There's something, don't underestimate, you know,
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.700]   our attraction to the visual.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.860]   So I don't think the model's there yet.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.740]   Like the, obviously the monetization model
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.100]   is coming there for podcasts.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.340]   I mean, the ad rates are good.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.300]   Really good shows are getting bought up
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.220]   in the networks for real money.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.820]   You know, people are making more on podcasts
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.300]   than they would have made in low end TV.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.420]   So like the model is there for podcasting.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.540]   YouTube, not really.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.860]   I mean, there's like the super like professional YouTubers
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.900]   trying to do the Mr. B style.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.420]   I have millions and millions of viewers
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.180]   and trying to, that game.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.900]   But I think there's another video game
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.300]   that hasn't emerged yet.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.420]   Where like high quality video, approximating cable,
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.580]   where the revenue is not from some incredibly low CPM
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.980]   automated YouTube ad, but from something else.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.260]   And maybe that's nothing to do with YouTube.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.900]   It's on private apps or networks.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.740]   I don't know, but I mean, I think there's something.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.380]   - Well, even on Tyler Cohen's podcast recently,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.980]   he was talking to Horowitz and what's the partner's name?
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.860]   He was talking to the partner
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.980]   and they were talking about how-
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.820]   - Andreessen.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.660]   - Yeah, Andreessen.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.500]   - Mark Andreessen.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.300]   - And he was talking about how the economic model
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.020]   for podcasts actually isn't there yet.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.860]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.700]   - He's like, it's starting to get there, but it's still,
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.220]   he was explaining, he does a much better job
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.060]   of explaining it than I did,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.380]   but it was pretty cool to listen to.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.940]   - Yeah, 'cause I know two people, not well,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.540]   but just like I've crossed paths with them
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.420]   or talked with them who in the last year or two
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.860]   have done seven figure deals for podcasting.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.740]   I mean, the interesting thing about that is,
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.060]   like in writing, for example,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.500]   which has been around forever,
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.060]   seven figure deals are very, very hard
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.700]   and they're very, very rare, right?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.860]   I mean, the level of success you have to have
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.020]   in the world of writing in terms of where you rank
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.180]   among other writers to do seven figure deals
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.820]   is like really at the tippy top.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820]   These guys doing seven figure deals for podcast
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.700]   are not at that super elite level.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.580]   It's not like, okay, these are the names.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.980]   I mean, if you're doing a seven figure deal for a book,
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.300]   people know who you are.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.700]   These are not podcasters who people are like,
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.380]   oh yeah, I know that show, right?
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.740]   So there's something interesting going on.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.100]   I think it's a highly monetizable world.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.860]   It's the, I don't know, Jordan Harbinger and I
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.860]   talked about this when we did, I guess last summer,
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.180]   I don't know, I had him on the show a while ago
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.020]   and we got deep into the economics of podcasting
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.460]   and we tried to get into this
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.700]   and I was kind of arguing that the peak of,
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.860]   you know, you can make a good living
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.180]   is actually way broader on that than in other things.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.340]   He kind of disagreed,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.660]   but it was like something's interesting going on.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.940]   When I know two people who's like,
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.980]   if I grab someone on the street and said their name,
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.100]   they don't know who they are,
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.220]   but are doing these seven figure deals,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.380]   something's interesting going on
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.860]   because in almost every other media,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.780]   if you're doing seven figure deals,
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.500]   at the very least you're a popular host of a radio show.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.260]   You're like, you have a pretty good prime time,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.380]   maybe early prime time cable news show.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.380]   Your book is at the front of the bookstore at the airport
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.180]   and podcasting is bringing people to that level.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.900]   - It's similar to like internet marketing,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.980]   how people kill it on the internet, you know?
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.140]   And like you can compare that
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.500]   to like a brick and mortar business
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.100]   and some of these internet marketers
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.980]   or you would see this simple website
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.260]   and it generates millions and millions of dollars a month.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.100]   It's kind of similar.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.620]   - Yeah, you've told me about some of that world.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.660]   Like the numbers are crazy.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.740]   - Yeah, they're insane.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.180]   - Forget seven, talk eight figures or more, right?
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.620]   - Some of them, I mean, it's really hard to figure out,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.180]   but if you figure it out, I mean,
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.260]   but even like the seven figure ones or whatever,
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.540]   I mean, that's doable, you know?
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.460]   - Yeah, so it's interesting.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.780]   I love those trends.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.940]   So I think video, like, so audio is getting there.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.640]   Text never got there.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.220]   It was very, the upper limit
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.620]   for monetizing democratized text
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.380]   after the World Wide Web came along,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.540]   the upper limit there was the ceiling
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.780]   was relatively low.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:48.220]   Like Andrew Sullivan could get high six figures
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.740]   for the Daily Dish, but it was a huge pain.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.340]   You know, it was a huge pain technically.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.540]   You know, I think some people now with Substack
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.740]   can do like high six figures,
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.740]   but it's like, that's a ceiling for people
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.140]   who are at the very top of the game,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.700]   the very top of their pyramid.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.540]   Audio seems to be, you know, better.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.820]   Like I could replace my Georgetown salary
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.420]   with what we're doing right now,
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.460]   which is a half day a week.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.380]   So that's like, something's happening there.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.020]   And we see these people doing seven figure stuff
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.380]   and video I think is gonna maybe have an even bigger ceiling.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.380]   I just don't think it's figured it out yet.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.900]   Obviously YouTube ads is not what is going
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.380]   to monetize video in a meaningful way.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.660]   It's just the numbers aren't there.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.660]   It only rewards virality and certain types of like content
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.460]   that serves to the algorithm.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.460]   But I think there's gonna be monetization
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.820]   that gets free from the algorithm.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.820]   - So we'll see.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.060]   - That's kind of what Mark was talking about.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.500]   - Right, so that's what he was.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.340]   - I can't really explain it well,
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.420]   but I'd have to listen to it again.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.660]   But he was talking about some stuff.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.220]   - This was, so this was on Tyler Cowen's podcast
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.060]   kind of recently.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.860]   - Yeah, I just listened to it last week.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.860]   - Andreessen and Horowitz were both.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.700]   - It was just Mark.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   - Just Mark Andreessen, yeah.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.060]   - On the show, interesting.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.020]   - He reads a lot too.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.540]   You probably get along with him.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.700]   - Never met him.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.540]   - You guys, I could tell you guys would be able
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.540]   to talk about a lot of stuff.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.380]   - Yeah.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.860]   (upbeat music)
