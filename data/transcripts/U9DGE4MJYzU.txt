[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, last time we were together on Wednesday,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   we looked at a warning text in the Bible that applies to our media diets.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's Hebrews 2.1. That was the text.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It encourages us to focus our attention and not get distracted from the cross.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   An incredibly important text for our lives inside the attention economy,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   as it's been called now.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Today's question also relates to our media diets.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   It comes from an anonymous listener asking about a Christian view of fiction.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Here it is. Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I've been struggling to understand 1 Timothy 1.4 and Paul's warning against myths.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   What implications does this verse against ancient myths have for a culture like ours,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   full of contemporary myths and fictional storytelling?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Jesus told stories. C.S. Lewis wrote great fictional stories.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Harry Potter is a best-selling series of contemporary mythology.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So how do we view our own cultural myths, our captivating novels and superhero movies
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and long-running TV series, considering Paul's warning to believers to not be devoted to myths?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Do we face a spiritual danger in our fiction today or not?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   That's a good question. It's a good question exegetically for what Paul meant.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We want to start there and then relate it to some things today.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Let's put the New Testament word "myth" or Greek "mythos"—it's the very same word in Greek.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Let's put it in front of us. It's used five times in the New Testament,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   four in Paul and one in 2 Peter.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So here they are. 1 Timothy 1.4.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "Charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   which promote speculations rather than stewardship from God that is by faith."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   1 Timothy 4.7. "Have nothing to do with irreverent and silly myths.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Rather, train yourself in godliness."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   2 Timothy 4.3-5. "The time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   to suit their own passions and will turn away from listening to the truth
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And then Titus 1.12. "Rebuke the cretins sharply that they may be sound in the faith,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then 2 Peter 1.16. "We did not follow cleverly devised myths
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So those are all the uses of the word "myth" in the New Testament.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The dictionary definition, if you look up in a Greek dictionary,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   of the first century, it means a tale, a legend, a story,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   that over time became fictional narrative over against historical account of things.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Now the way Paul and Peter are using the term is clearly negative.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   If you take those five texts that I just read, here are the associations with myths.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Myths promote speculations. They are like endless genealogies.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They don't get anywhere. They don't land anywhere solid.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He calls them "old wives tales" in 1 Timothy 4.7,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and maybe that's because there were vulnerable women that we meet at the church in Ephesus
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   who were "always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   In other words, there was this endless speculative approach towards things there,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   never get their feet on the ground of God's reality, and myths were feeding into that.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Myths were irreverent and empty. They were the opposite of training oneself in godliness.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   They were a wandering away from truth.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   They were cleverly devised and not based on eyewitness accounts.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So Paul's main problem with them—if you step back and say, "What's the big picture here?"—
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   his main problem with them is that they weren't serving what he calls the "oikonomia,"
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   the household plan of God, namely the up-building of faith.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I think that would be his summary criticism.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   These are not doing what God means to be done in his house, build people up in faith,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   give them a firm place to stand and make their faith strong.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So, in summary, myths, as Paul and Peter dealt with them in their letters, were not just faults,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   but they were destabilizing.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That is, they didn't result in helping people plant their feet anywhere in God's reality.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   They promoted speculations, endless openness, never coming to a knowledge of anything.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Like old Chesterton, he said, "There's a good reason to open your mouth."
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   In other words, be open-minded, but you open your mouth in order to bite down on something.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You understand? Your mouth endlessly open.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And that's what Paul was concerned.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I see that today in a lot of places, just an endless opening to possibilities,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   but never a closing of your mouth on anything enriching.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Now, what about myth today?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The word has ordinary meanings and technical literary meanings.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Kind of complex.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   For example, the second meaning in the Oxford English Dictionary is, quote,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   "a widely held misconception," period.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That's it. That is, "Oh, that's a myth," you know, an erroneous belief.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So in that sense, a myth is the opposite of reality.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's false to what is.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Or it can refer to stories in general, and they might be true,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and communicate truth and help truth advance, or they might be misleading.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Or, thirdly, it can refer to something quite technical.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Let's say in C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, as they develop the term
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and work on writing that kind of literature,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   a myth, they would say, is a structure of ultimate reality,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   which can be pointed to, hinted at, or embodied in lots of different forms.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Fables, epic poetry, novels, dramas.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And in that technical sense, myth is the ultimate story
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   within various literary forms and not reducible to any literary form.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And the really important thing to grasp for Lewis is that he means to say
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   that Christianity is true myth.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He's got this essay called "Myth Became Fact."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Here's a quote. This is Lewis.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "The heart of Christianity is a myth."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   If you stop there, that'd be heresy, right?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I mean, given the ordinary meaning of the word.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   "The heart of Christianity is a myth, which is also a fact.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The old myth of the dying God, without ceasing to be myth,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   comes down from heaven, the heaven of legend and imagination,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   to the earth of history. It happens at a particular date,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   a particular place, followed by definable historical consequences."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   So that's Lewis.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So let's step back now and ask about whether myths,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   as Paul used the term, and as many use it today,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   is a problem or a danger for Christians who love the truth.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   What really is, that's what I mean by truth, what really is God
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and all that God has revealed about his thoughts and his ways,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   his view of things.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Not just what human imagination can make up, but what God says is real.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Paul's warning was that myths were leading people away from the truth
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and thus destroying people.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   They were, in fact, creating an indifference to the truth.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   As anything fixed and stirring up endless speculations,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   they were fascinating. They were intriguing people,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   but not helping them land them anywhere.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I get nervous when I'm around people who constantly use the word,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   "Oh, that's intriguing," or "That's fascinating."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And they don't ever use categories of truth, right, wrong, good, bad,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   beautiful, ugly. It's just intriguing.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I think Paul was dealing with that all the time in Ephesus, evidently.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They don't get their feet on the ground of truth,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and they're not stable with a clear sight of God and his ways and his will.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So that is what we should watch out for.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   That's the way I would sum up the issue today.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The use of stories to lead away from truth and to use the stories
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   to destabilize people by replacing the very concept of firm, true,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   stable reality with open-endedness, that's always going to be a problem.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Ever learning, never coming to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And that might happen through novels or TV dramas or movies or theater.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Do they serve the truth or lead away from it and diminish the importance of it?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   But here's the reason we must not lump all fiction into the category of misleading myth
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   or destabilizing myth.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Fiction as a way of leading to truth is firmly embedded in the Bible.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   That's why we can't toss it out.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   God inspired it. God used it.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   For example, Jesus told parables.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And the point of these little short fictional stories was to tell the truth
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   in a peculiar way.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   The prophet Nathan convicted David of his sin by telling him a fictional story
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   about a lamb.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Isaiah developed parable-like stories throughout his prophecies,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   like the one in Isaiah 5, 1 to 6, where Israel is compared to a vineyard.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And he goes on and on about Israel as his vineyard.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   In fact, the Bible rings, I mean literally rings on every page virtually
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   with hundreds of similes and metaphors, which you could describe as
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   tiny fictional pictures of things.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Jesus says, "I am the gate of the sheep."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   That's a little tiny piece of fiction.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   "I am the gate of the sheep."
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Or in Revelation, Jesus says to his obedient people,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   "I will make you a pillar in the temple of my God."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   That's a little piece of fiction that tells a glorious truth.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I don't expect to be Lot's wife made out of marble in the kingdom to come.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   It's a picture.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's a fictional picture of something glorious and real.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   These are what you might call micro-fiction,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   clearly intended to lead us to the truth.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So not all fictional storytelling is anti-truth.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So how shall we be discerning?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And I would ask at least these four questions.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Number one, what kind of literature or drama are we reading or watching?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Do we know it's fiction or non-fiction?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Two, do we know how fiction can tell the truth or mislead?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   We need to be aware of both and not be sucked in to a view of the world
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   that distorts reality as God intends it to be known.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Measure the fictional portrayal of non-fictional reality
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   by the reality revealed in God's Word.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Third, does it increase or clarify our knowledge of and enjoyment of the truth?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Do we understand reality better?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Do we feel about reality the way God intends for us to feel
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   about the reality being spoken of?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And fourth, does it leave us with a greater love for truth?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Love for truth, not just knowledge, but love for truth.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Or does it destabilize us and make us more uncertain about the very concept of truth,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   suspicious of truth, confused about truth?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   The Apostle Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 2.10,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "People are perishing because they did not welcome a love for the truth
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   in order to be saved."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So he didn't just say people are perishing because they don't know the truth.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He said they're perishing because they don't love the truth.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Our salvation hangs on loving the truth.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   That was Paul's great concern with myths in his day.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   They were leading people away from truth,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and they were undermining the very value of truth,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and they were knocking the foundations from under faith and godliness,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and so they were destroying people.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And yes, that can and does happen today.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yes. Good caution here, Pastor John. Thank you.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Well, every Christian will continue to struggle with sin.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   We know this, and that's why Jesus taught us to pray for daily forgiveness.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And if that's true, that we will never live a sinless day in this life,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   how on earth can we ever attain to a good conscience?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   That's the next question up.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   How can a redeemed Christian with remaining sin within
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   ever attain to a good conscience or a clean conscience?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Another great question.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Up on Monday, I'm your host, Tony Reiki.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Have a great weekend, and we will see you then.
