[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   A bunch of the seniors on the OSU football team
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.440]   decided to forego going to the NFL for a year
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.920]   because they felt like God wanted to do something more.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.560]   But I think the best part was that all these players,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.480]   they have legit testimonies
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.800]   and they have a heart to preach the gospel.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.480]   It felt a little bit like being in Acts 2
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.120]   when revival is coming onto campus.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.200]   - All right, hello everyone.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.640]   Welcome to the official, unofficial Acts 2 network podcast.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.720]   I'm Steven.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.560]   - I'm Isaiah.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040]   - And today we have Will joining us on the show.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.880]   - Good to be here.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.080]   - Yeah, Will, why don't you introduce yourself a little bit.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.200]   Yeah, your peer class, where you're serving now,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.040]   stuff like that.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   - Yeah, my name is Will Wu.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.320]   I'm class of 2009 from Los Angeles originally.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.560]   I have peer serving all around the US.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.120]   Got some guys in Irvine, Albert Locke.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.880]   He's not in Irvine, he's in LA.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.840]   Got Nelson up in Michigan.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.280]   Got a bunch of guys in DMV, Nathan Chung.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.840]   They're some of the guys in my class.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.560]   - Nice, nice.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.800]   And you're serving now in OSU?
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000]   - Yep, Columbus, Ohio, the Ohio State University.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.880]   Got to make that clear.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.000]   It's important.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.960]   - And today's episode is going to be about some cool things
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.160]   that have happened this past fall there.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.760]   But before we get there, maybe you could just take us through,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.880]   like how did you end up at Columbus, Ohio serving there.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.280]   And yeah.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.320]   - Yeah, well, Chris and I, we were serving at Pittsburgh.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   We were part of the 2017 church plant.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   - The Great Scattering.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   - The Great Scattering.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.880]   - You went from Berkeley.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.600]   - Yeah, from Berkeley to Pittsburgh.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   And then we got to serve there for four years.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.880]   Along the way, we got a chance to do a vision trip out there at one point.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   And then in 2021, you know, there was talk about more church planting.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   And we kind of knew that either our couple or Angel and Judy's couple
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.440]   is probably going to go somewhere.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   It bounced back many times, many locations.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.520]   And then we just got asked, "Hey, what about Ohio State?"
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.080]   And we thought, "Oh, that's a big campus."
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.040]   Sounds good.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.720]   Let's go.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.120]   It's a little bit late in the school year.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   I mean, our team was assembled, I think, in May, right before we left.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.920]   We landed in July.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   I mean, we were asked a little bit earlier, but the team was assembled later
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.400]   and kind of got some people from around the network who volunteered.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600]   And then we had the privilege to move out there.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.640]   So it was really cool.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   - Yeah.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.520]   - So before that, you were in Berkeley undergrad, and then, yeah.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   So, yeah, you guys had some history.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.440]   - Fun connection.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   - Yeah.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.280]   - Yeah.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.840]   - Will was a senior when I was a freshman, very first student archers that I met.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.400]   And then after I graduated, Will was my leader for a year before you went to Taiwan.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   - Yep, before I went to Taiwan.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.760]   - Yeah, so you've been to a lot of different places.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.320]   And then when we, I remember when you were my leader,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.960]   there was a car ride we had where we both talked about like,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.240]   "Hey, would you go full-time one day?"
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.120]   You know, and both of us were talking about going full-time in ministry for our church.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   And then when I went full-time, we overlapped for about like three, four months before you
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   went to Pittsburgh.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   - I think so.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   - And that was kind of a neat...
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.040]   - We had a neat moment sharing the office going, "Wow, that car ride has fled."
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.200]   - That came full circle.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   - Wow, that's neat.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.480]   - So we were the two young guys at HP for a little bit.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.360]   That was nice.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   That was pretty amazing.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   - Yeah.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.480]   - So let's just cut to the chase.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.640]   Let's jump right to it because this is a really neat story.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   For those of you who don't know, it's like four days ago, or at least at the time of this recording,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.760]   NPR did a segment, and this article is called, "The Ohio State," they forgot that part.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.240]   - Football players are leading a religious revival on campus, and it's about these Christian
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.280]   football players, not just any football players, but some of the like really well-known...
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   - Some of the starters.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   - Yeah, the starters.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.720]   They held like a religious revival event, and maybe what people don't know is that we had
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   a role in that.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   - Yeah.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.720]   - So maybe you can kind of share about like how were we involved, how did that get started?
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   - Yeah.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   - Sure.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   So this started before the school year, right before the school year, about mid-August.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.160]   And our professor who sponsors our group, he's pretty well-connected with the just campus
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   Christian population.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.680]   He kind of started a prayer group the year prior for just all Christians on campus.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.320]   So he's kind of well-known for just being a connector, and he's had some football players
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.920]   in his class before, I believe, just built some friendships.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.600]   And it turns out that the OSU football team, there are some solid Christians who have been
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.040]   kind of passing down the faith and reaching the next generation.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   - Wow.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   How long has that been going on?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.000]   - I think at least five or six years, maybe.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So a little bit more recent.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.840]   They do Bible studies and stuff like that.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.040]   But really, two guys who had graduated, Cam Babb and Master Teague, you know, one of them
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   was in the NFL for a little bit.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   You know, they're still really connected to the players that have a really solid locker
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.040]   room.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.640]   And, you know, they were growing in their faith while they were on the football team.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.480]   And so there's just kind of a good culture going there.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.040]   You know, the guys there, they're really tight.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.980]   Apparently, you know, the ministers, the athletes, they've been really solid over the years.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.980]   And then a vision sparked in their mind.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.940]   You know, last year, there are three pretty awesome players who could have gone to the
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.440]   NFL.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.700]   And collectively, a bunch of the seniors on the OSU football team decide to forego going
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.020]   to the NFL for a year, stay for their senior year, because they felt like God wanted to
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.020]   do something more.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020]   - Wow.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.940]   - Not just to win a championship, which hopefully they do this year.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.860]   But yeah, we'll see, I mean, but they want to do something more for God.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.700]   And, you know, so they're like, Hey, you know, we should do something.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.740]   Now, mind you, this is like only a couple of weeks before the school year started.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.080]   And so they're like, let's put on a revival night, you know, let's share our testimonies.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.560]   Let's do some praise and then let's do on the spot baptisms.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   Wow.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.840]   Now, interestingly enough, the OSU football team is not considered a student group.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.180]   So they can't reserve venues, interesting, right?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.600]   You know, they make millions of dollars.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   They can't reserve a venue.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.140]   So our professor just asked us, Hey, you know, I'm connected to the football team.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.800]   They kind of want to do this revival night.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.260]   And I'm like, and they're like, we need a venue.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.460]   Do you think our group could reserve it?
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.960]   I'm like, sure.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   And he's like, well, you know, it's going to be kind of big, like they want to make
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.880]   it like thousands of people and this is very last minute planning.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.740]   So, you know, there's possible that we're not going to follow
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.240]   all the rules and stuff like that.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.080]   You know, there might be a few things happening.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.340]   And I'm just like, well, the football team is like, they're like dogs on campus.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.700]   Right.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.340]   And these are three of the starters.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.540]   It's a hundred thousand people.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.540]   Um, and so I'm like, well, what's the worst that could happen, right?
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.740]   The football players are not going to shut us down or anything.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.580]   So let's do it.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.580]   And, um, you know, our, our student president, you know, put in the reservations.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.920]   Um, they had to do some back and forth explain because it was such a last minute event of
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   a pretty big scale.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.420]   And we got the venue.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.260]   So that's kind of our main involvement.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.420]   The venue was on a giant lawn in the middle of the freshmen dorms.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.420]   Wow.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.420]   And so there's four dorms surrounding it.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.420]   It's a really big one.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.420]   Like the, the X.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.420]   There's a little bit of crisscross around it.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   It can fit a couple thousand people.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.580]   Cause at first they were thinking about a 500 person amphitheater, but they're like, I mean,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.980]   this is the OSU football players, like just the Christian groups alone are going to fill
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.980]   it up.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.980]   So we need a bigger venue.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.920]   So, um, we got that venue.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.200]   Um, and I think what was really cool was, you know, it wasn't just our group, it was churches
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   across the city.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.800]   I'd say a lot of the campus ministry groups is a collaboration amongst all of us.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.140]   We had a few meeting and planning calls, um, just to organize it, to do publicity.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.100]   They literally put posters, like printed thousands of posters, put them on everything, which was
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.180]   part of what we got dinged for.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.020]   It was called the fall football kickoff night or something like that.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.700]   And you have some of the players, you know, all off, they're like praying, praying to God.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.540]   That's clearly very, like a spiritual.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.540]   Very spiritual.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   It was very clear.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   It was going to be a spiritual event.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.740]   Um, and so, you know, night comes, uh, we got to help out.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.680]   We got to help out with, you know, like ushering people that used our TV screen for pro-pre.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.180]   One of our staff got to be pro-pre, another guy got to, um, take video for them.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:29.900]   So, overall, it was a really cool event, you know, um, and basically what happened was,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.580]   you know, people start gathering, start bringing out their lawn chairs, 10, 15 minutes before
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.580]   the event.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   There's a few hundred people.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.460]   By the time it started and kind of really got going, I think they estimated about 2000 people
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.400]   showed up, um, and it started with rock and praise.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.160]   But I think the best part was that all these players, um, they have legit testimonies and
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.020]   they have a heart to preach the gospel.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.560]   You know, one of the star running backs, Travion Henderson, he was sharing, kind of went through
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.900]   a period of depression after getting injured, but it was God who rescued him.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.340]   And now he realizes, like, man, life is so much more than football because you can get
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.960]   injured one minute and everything's over.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.040]   Right.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.360]   And so some of these players, they were just sharing their heart.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.740]   And at the, the end, the tight end, man, he's a preacher in the making.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.900]   He gives this amazing message on Luke 15.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.440]   He's like, as people are walking by, he's like, Hey, you stop.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.500]   Like, listen to this.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.940]   This is, you know, this is a chance to listen, you know, not cause we're football.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.560]   And so, you know, he's like, you know, and everyone's like, what is going on?
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.100]   So he gives a call to accept Christ.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.600]   People start streaming up to the front.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.920]   I mean, it is amazing.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.380]   Right.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.840]   And you're looking left and right.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.480]   I mean, there's all these football players there.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.860]   And just people on the campus are streaming over, making decisions to follow Christ.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.880]   I mean, during the praise time, it was like raucous.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.860]   Like it was awesome.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:53.660]   It felt a little bit like being in Acts 2 when like, you know, revival is coming onto campus.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.420]   And so, and then after that, uh, they did on the spot baptisms.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.000]   They had these five football tubs from the football facility, their ice baths.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.920]   So they brought them over and we helped fill them up and everything.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.900]   And then at first, actually, they asked some of the ministers to baptize people, but then
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.600]   realized like, no, the football players want to do it.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.580]   So we just like, Hey, you guys do it.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.660]   Um, and then after the event, um, as people are getting baptized, we led them to a room where
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.940]   they could get kind of just confirmed in what they like just did.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.660]   You know, they really want to make sure like these guys understand the decision, right?
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.400]   It's not just, I want to go into water because football players are putting me in water.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.160]   So, you know, there was like, there was a good 30 minute session where, you know, they're
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.420]   getting Bibles, they're getting connected to ministry groups.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.880]   All the churches are there.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.640]   And then, um, yeah, we basically kept going because praise started happening until the
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.000]   cops came and told us we had to close the event.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.900]   It was past 10 PM.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.720]   So we quickly shut down everything as quick as we could cleaned up, emptied out the baptismals.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.480]   Um, and man, it was, it was a powerful time.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.880]   I mean, people are coming to Christ.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.940]   Some of those people who went to that event, I mean, they, you know, they spread out amongst
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.800]   all the Christian groups.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.440]   Um, yeah, so if you, I mean, like you can see this all online, you know, if you look
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.540]   it up, there's Instagram videos and everything like that.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.200]   So in terms of the event itself, people can look that up.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   But yeah, what was kind of your perspective doing a lot of the background work, having
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.220]   organized everything?
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.680]   What was something that stood out to you about the event that made it like maybe more than
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.080]   just a revival night or like, yeah, maybe you can, you know, I think for me, um, and our
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.060]   team, I think it was just kept telling them, Hey, we get to play a small part in something
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.080]   bigger that God wants to do on this campus.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.040]   You know, every single week on Saturday, we do, we have a prayer walk on campus.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.960]   We're praying for revival and you know, God, you know, there's no way one group can do that.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.180]   Right.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.860]   And so, how big is OSU?
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.860]   OSU is about 65,000 college students.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.680]   Um, uh, no, within, including grad students.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.980]   But 65,000 strong.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.400]   It's one of the top five biggest campuses, I think.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.620]   And, and it was just a privilege, I think, to get to play just even a little part knowing
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.520]   like, Hey, our reservation allowed these guys to preach the gospel.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   And, you know, it was their idea.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.940]   We just got to be a part of it.
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.540]   And I was like, this is what the church is about, you know?
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.380]   And, uh, people got blessed by it.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.980]   I know that's, that's not, you know, always true of like every campus and the Christian
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.780]   groups are on that campus.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.640]   But it's amazing.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.380]   It's just by the sheer scale that all the Christian groups are like, we need every one of us to
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.020]   be doing stuff.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.860]   And so that's a really neat sort of culture.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.940]   Now, um, that, that kind of came into play a little later because there was some fallout.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.560]   There was some fallout.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.880]   Yeah, there was a little bit of fallout.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.500]   So, so it, it, like I mentioned, it felt a little bit like the book of Acts.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.220]   So afterwards, you know, you expect, you know, this amazing event happening.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's in the newspaper.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.740]   It's on like the news channels and stuff.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.680]   And, you know, we expected, okay, well, it's the football players.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.000]   They're probably not going to like get mad or anything like that.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.260]   Right.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.740]   Well, it turns out, you know, they probably still have to follow their rules.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.620]   So, um, we get an email from it's good.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.760]   You know, they're trying to follow the rules.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.380]   The school is trying to do what they're supposed to do.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:07.680]   But, um, our student president, our faculty sponsor, and I, we get called in by the school.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.520]   Um, we have to sit in front of all these very official people telling us all the violations
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.920]   we made over the night, which we kind of knew was going to happen.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.220]   I mean, we lit posters went to like hundreds of people there.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.680]   It was like everywhere around campus.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.620]   So you're not supposed to do that kind of knew that, but, um, and then, you know, the
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.640]   baptismals, it didn't, it wasn't on the actual reservation, so you have to list everything.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.880]   So it's not necessarily that you can't do it, but it was planned in like two weeks.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.600]   So the scale of it kind of was pretty big.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.680]   Um, so they talked to us, um, we got a little bit dinged by the campus.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.060]   Uh, we got put on probation as a group, so you could still reserve rooms, but, um, you have
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.660]   to pay for it now, um, you know, that half the normal price and whatnot.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:59.160]   So it ended up tolling with all our reservations, maybe being about $5,000 cost, which, you know,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.180]   I'm thinking about like a couple of salvations, Hey, you know, totally worth it.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.900]   But, um, I think what was really cool though, was afterwards, um, a lot of local Christians
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.380]   reached out to us.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.840]   So they sent out an email, the football revival group to all the people saying, Hey, if you
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.660]   want to donate, you know, the group that sponsored that to pay basically for some of that stuff.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:26.280]   Um, and then even a local kind of unite the city group contacted us and, uh, it's called
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.160]   for Columbus.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.680]   Um, they put in their newsletter if anyone wanted to donate to help with some of the funds.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   So it was really cool.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.300]   And even through that, a lot of other people got to participate.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.180]   Um, but at first it really felt like, you know, the Sanhedrin are calling you in and flashing
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.180]   you because in the back of my mind, I'm like, Oh, does this mean we're not going to have reservations
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.180]   for the rest of the year?
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.180]   Like we could get kicked off.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.680]   But then even other groups are saying like, Hey, you know, we can reserve rooms for you if
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.180]   you need, like, we know that you took the bullet.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.840]   So it just felt like it brought a lot of people together and God was using that to bring people
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   together in a lot of cool ways.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.420]   All things considered, uh, having to pay for reservations, not the worst thing that I'm
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.560]   like, other campus groups are paying for their reservations.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   Like, Hey, you know, that's not so bad.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   Wow.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   Wow.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.120]   Um, like what, what has happened since on campus has the vibe changed or like, or more
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   of online?
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.880]   So, um, there's really positive just overall, you just talk to people almost everyone on campus
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   had heard of it.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.380]   I mean, it was in the newspapers and the local news.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.680]   Um, so overall people just had a really good impression.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.740]   I think just talking to other campus ministers, they just, they've all mentioned like they've
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.000]   just been coming to all of our groups because they heard of it.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.840]   Parents have been telling their kids, Hey, go to that.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   You know, um, it seems like the football players, from my understanding, I talked to a couple
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   of them.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.840]   They said they want to try something even bigger next semester where they can plan a little
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   more for it.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   Okay.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.840]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.180]   Um, I do think that they're talking about renting out like the basketball auditorium or whatever
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.740]   that can fit like tens of thousands, who knows what'll happen.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.640]   I think they're busy getting ready for the playoffs, but maybe after.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.280]   After the playoffs, they'll have a little time to settle down and figure out.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.580]   So I think they want to do something more before they graduate and they just want to like highlight
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   God.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.500]   I mean, the whole night was about God and you know, cause they're football players, people
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.980]   come, but they were really trying to just share the gospel and preach.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.480]   As you, as you share that, two things stand out to me.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.880]   One, it's so cool that like the most talked about event on campus is a Christian event.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.520]   You know, and, and, um, that, you know, not that we had that and in Philly, you know, but,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.120]   um, uh, I remember during our welcome week, just a lot of the Christian groups doing really
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.380]   cool events and people just going like, why is this not a Christian group weekend and stuff
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.380]   like that?
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   Like what that's going on?
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.440]   And it's just really neat when, um, you see that happen, um, that the, the Christian groups
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.220]   are so active towards the campus that, that that's the most talked about thing.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.220]   Right.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.100]   So that, that itself, I think helps just set a certain kind of atmosphere on campus.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.660]   Second thing is like these football players are seniors.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.660]   Right.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.720]   And so like they want to take advantage of their last year to make that impact on campus.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.700]   And that's something we see in college ministry.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.140]   It's just really neat to see like football players doing that.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.140]   right.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.140]   And like how, how that can, you know, impact the campus.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.540]   And so that's just very inspiring to hear that sort of thing.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.020]   I had a, like one final question.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.900]   It's kind of more a personal question for you, but, um, you played, you played football.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.900]   I did.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900]   I did.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.300]   I played for four years in high school.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Four years.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   I did.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   I was a lineman.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   Lineman.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.300]   Okay.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   I know I don't look it.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.640]   And I didn't look it back then, but you know, we came from a very small, humble school.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.140]   So even a guy like me could play a starting position.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.420]   So you, you, you played football in high school.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.380]   You, you weren't really Christian at the time.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.000]   I know your story, just, you're, you're my leader, you know, and then, but you're wearing
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.380]   now this, the shirt from the event.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380]   Yes.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.380]   Jesus won.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:55.640]   So what would, what would high school, non-Christian football gamer, woo-woo like see, like, what
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.580]   would he think seeing you wearing this shirt and having done this thing?
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.640]   He would be mind blown about how God can transform people and be like, wow, like who knew?
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.920]   Like, I mean, part of the reason I was so excited to just say yes immediately was cause I love
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   football.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.920]   So I'm like, football.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.920]   Yes.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.200]   So, um, so yeah, I think.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   Tell us a little bit of your story.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Just like, yeah.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   Reflecting on that.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   I think, um, my story is just one of being able to step into places that God had already kind
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   of created, you know, like I grew up in church, wasn't a personal faith.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.480]   When I stepped into our church back in 2005, you know, I was always looking for something
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.760]   more, you know, like if this thing is true, I really want to know.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.040]   And if it's true, I want to go for it.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   Um, and when I got to our church, I found a compelling picture of people really wanting
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.300]   to share their faith, living out the actual church, fell in love with it and been around
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   ever since.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.180]   And, um, you know, that's why I stuck around with our church.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.040]   That's why I wanted to go out and keep reaching out to college students.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:57.900]   But it was seeing, um, both college students and young adults, uh, live out their faith
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.200]   that really compelled me.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.000]   Um, and I think it's still one of the most compelling pictures.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.980]   I'm thankful you do that because, uh, because then I met you and now I'm here too, you know,
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.980]   and everything.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   Amazing how God works.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.260]   Well, good luck with, um, the, the playoffs.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.260]   Yes.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.260]   I know.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   I can't root for you guys because there's like other people in our network and be like, "No!
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260]   What the heck?"
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260]   Like, there's little rivalries going on.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.260]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260]   This podcast does not endorse any official NFL team.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   Good luck.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260]   And man, we're, we're looking forward to hearing more of, yeah, hopefully more revival nights,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260]   more just impact on that campus.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.260]   Hopefully other campuses too.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   Who knows?
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260]   I've heard that.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.260]   Inspire other teams.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.260]   Other teams have been talking about it.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.260]   Praise the Lord.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260]   Awesome.
