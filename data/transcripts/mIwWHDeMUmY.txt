[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Pre and Early Retirement and Retired Life Stages
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.680]   Chapters and recorded January 10th, 2024.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.440]   It features Jill Steinberg, PhD, presenting the topic, Finding Purpose in Retirement from
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.120]   Retiring to Rewiring.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.760]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   investment advice.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.760]   So, Jill, why don't you tell us what you've been up to before you start your presentation?
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760]   Okay.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.440]   So, it's kind of a funny question.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   What have I been up to?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.440]   At my age, there's the sad loss list and there's the everything else list.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.200]   So I think in the interest of my mood and this presentation, I'll go to the everything
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200]   else list.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.520]   So I'll tell you a few things.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.640]   I can't exactly remember when I did the last Bogleheads.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.320]   So did you know that my research got published as a chapter in a book?
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.240]   Was that completed yet?
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   Congratulations.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240]   Thanks.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.120]   Yeah, I feel really good about it because I was working with the University of Michigan,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.800]   the Ross Business School, and the faculty there, two of them put out this book and Rutledge
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   published it.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   And I'm the only chapter, it's called The Aging Consumer Perspectives from Psychology
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640]   and Economics.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.800]   I'm the only chapter that doesn't deal with finances.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.560]   You know, it's geared for business schools and minds, quality of life.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.520]   So that felt, that feels really good.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.160]   And then I'm working with Boston University, I was working on and off with their Alumni
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.080]   Association the last 10 years.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.720]   And we started a new initiative to engage their alumni that are my age and my stage
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   of life.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   So you know how alumni associations you should go with early retire, mid career?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.720]   Well, we're vital, we're alive, we're alumni, we're the ones with time, we want purpose.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.360]   So we started a whole initiative to engage people our age and stage.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.260]   And the first project I'm doing after there was a presentation I gave, is I'm starting
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280]   a mentoring program of retirees to retirees.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   So that's really exciting for me.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.640]   And then I'll tell you something totally different than I didn't even know existed or could exist
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.060]   in my life.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.920]   So I have a dog, and I couldn't get a dog I felt till I retired.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.400]   And I have this really loving dog.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   And he just gives so much love that I got him to be a pet assisted therapist dog.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.900]   So we go into institutions, and he gives love for how people need it, including he helps
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.780]   kids that are afraid to read out loud, they'll read to him.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.640]   So it's just as an example, something I didn't even know existed.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.740]   And I didn't start it to the last year.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.180]   So at 72.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.500]   So it's it's pretty cool what you can do in retirement.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.740]   Is that a good enough beginning for yeah, and again, congrats on the chapter being published.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.740]   Thank you.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.740]   Thanks.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.760]   So yeah, that's plenty of talking because you're in for a lot of talking.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.400]   I've got a presentation tonight, I'll take about 3537 minutes, and then I have time for
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.180]   questions.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.240]   And I'll just start by saying I'm an emeritus professor and clinical psychologist, I'm 73.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.940]   And I retired 16 years ago.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.580]   Since retiring, my research publications, teaching and consulting had primarily dealt
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.180]   with successful retirement.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.020]   Okay, so I already messed up, I was going to go to the next slide.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.060]   And Jim, it's not going.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.580]   Maybe I have to click again.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580]   Ah, okay.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.580]   There we go.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.380]   So bear with me audience, Jim, and I just worked out something for me to be in charge
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.740]   of my own slides.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.100]   And it's pretty temperamental.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.540]   So I might have to give the control back to Jim, we'll see how it goes.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.120]   Anyway, I think I told you that my research and consulting is dealt with successful retirement.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.500]   And so those who plan for retirement, plan for their financial situation, and they tend
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.940]   to think about their life, kind of like a long weekend, like a garden, yay, I'll have
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.380]   time to read, visit people, maybe bike ride, travel.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.100]   And the research finds that retirement can start with a great honeymoon phase.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.160]   People are really glad to have time, but then typically retirement proceeds with a steep
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.900]   decline in happiness, as people wake up to, okay, I did that, I did that, now what?
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.580]   And they find something is really missing.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.500]   And then that retirement usually stabilizes with as much happiness as people had while
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.640]   they were working.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.380]   Depending on the survey, so let's see, yeah, it's not going, oh, there we go, okay.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:26.580]   Depending on the survey, at best 75% of people who are privileged enough to retire even enjoy
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.580]   it.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:36.740]   Up to 25% have difficulty adjusting, 10% are not at all satisfied, and retirement satisfaction
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.660]   tends to decrease as people age, hold on.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.780]   And this is true regardless of the age the person retires.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.620]   Having purpose, this is tricky, it's not doing its thing, Jim, okay.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.940]   Having purpose is a major component in terms of successful retirement, and actually a significant
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.100]   component throughout life at any stage of life.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.060]   And while developing the purpose in life is an ongoing process, the studies show that
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.440]   purpose in life tends to drop with older age.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.700]   So what I'm going to do tonight is give you, let's see, there's that one, okay, a multifaceted
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.580]   evidence-based presentation.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.580]   The first part is why purpose, what's so important about purpose, and then the bulk of it will
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.700]   be how do you find purpose.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.260]   So I'd like you in your heads to be thinking about your life, how do you view your life?
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.120]   Does your life feel meaningful with close relationships, purpose, and physical activities,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.340]   or are you feeling a bit adrift?
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.980]   Do you perceive yourself as stuck, or do you proactively think about, reflect on what you'd
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:05.020]   like to do to make things better, and even know what you find purposeful and care about?
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.860]   Okay, why find purpose?
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.980]   There's an abundance of research on the importance of having a purpose for physical and mental
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.700]   health and well-being across the lifespan.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:26.060]   However, the research suggests the reward of retiring may be the punishment of not mattering,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.660]   and purpose is powerful.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:35.180]   People who have a higher sense of purpose, which is defined as the extent to which they
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:45.980]   feel like they have, hmm, okay, there we go, meaningful goals and directions, okay, anyway,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.620]   people that have purpose, that feel like they have meaningful goals and direction, tend
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.460]   to live longer, healthier, and happier lives.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:00.420]   If you look at the long-term studies, longitudinal, where they use large samples of the same people
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:07.100]   over and over, they find that older people with a higher sense of purpose, for example,
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:13.900]   less at risk for neurocognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.220]   disease, and stroke.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.020]   Lack of purpose contributes at least as much to disease and death as do lifestyle factors
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.320]   such as tobacco use, poor diet, inactivity, and stress.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.660]   In the last hundred years, our longevity has increased about 30 years.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.900]   That's even with the recent dip during COVID, but our society's institutions, like our families,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.620]   our educational systems, our health places, our workplace, housing, even our neighborhoods
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.660]   haven't been updated to serve the needs of our aging population, which can impede our
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.160]   ability to find purpose.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.100]   So I'll give you an example with employment.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:06.260]   Employment can give you an avenue for social connection and identity, and when people retire,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.500]   it changes the structure such that it can lead to many losses, your sense of identity,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.820]   your roles, your social connections, your purpose, your daily structure, and the research
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:25.180]   says there is a negative correlation between retirement and purpose in life, but your sense
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.220]   of purpose is malleable later in life, and that's why you're here.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.780]   We're not doing the decline, so hopefully you learn stuff and leave tonight with things
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.760]   you're going to do right away.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.300]   So even though there's an abundance of research on the importance of purpose, there's an abundance
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:49.740]   of it, there's not so much research on how to find purpose, which is why I put this presentation
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.940]   together for you.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.100]   I'm going to tell you what exists in the literature of how to find purpose.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.740]   So let's see.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.780]   Now it stopped again.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.020]   Let's see.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   Okay.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.020]   What is purpose in life?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   Sorry, audience.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.980]   It's definitely quirky, and it throws me off from my presentation, so thanks for bearing
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.980]   with me.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.980]   So what is purpose?
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.020]   Purpose in life includes three characteristics.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:30.940]   Having a stable desirable goal, achieving something meaningful beyond yourself, and
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.720]   making progress towards accomplishing the goal.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.780]   Purpose in life can determine your goals and therefore influence decisions you make during
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   the day.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:49.200]   It's efficiency in action for your mind and your behaviors.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.620]   To give you an idea of how research assess purpose, here's some items from a widely used
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620]   scale.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.420]   So I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.740]   My daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.820]   I enjoy making plans for the future and working to make them a reality.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.380]   Okay, so let's go to how do you find purpose.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.280]   Let me check in with the people that can respond to me.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.500]   Can you hear me okay, and is my pace okay?
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   Both are perfect.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   Okay, good.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.900]   I'm still, I'm an East Coast transplant, and I go East Coast speed.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.340]   Okay, how do you find purpose?
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.060]   So this might be the first time you really have had the opportunity, the time and the
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.340]   resources to figure out and do what you want, what has meaning for you.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.060]   It's actually a paradoxical situation.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.020]   For years, people yearn for more autonomy and time to shape their lives.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.600]   And after retirement with plenty of time, individuals can feel lost, adrift, they experienced
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:05.320]   choice overload, and they have demands from their family and others that they never anticipated.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.100]   But I assume you go ahead are already have a good framework for how to approach finding
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.980]   purpose, because you've been thinking about planning and implementing ways to save for
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.420]   your retirement.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.580]   And you proactively chose to come to this presentation.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:27.620]   So in terms of purpose, one way to start finding your purposes by thinking about what have
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.340]   you been successful at accomplishing?
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:38.020]   Perhaps it's your financial planning or your career, your relationships, maybe it's how
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.420]   you do your physical activities, or maybe it's you've been able to continue learning.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:49.500]   Consider what you feel successful at, and what has worked for you in that process, and
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.480]   what hasn't worked for you.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.260]   So the essence of the purpose literature is finding out and see if I can get there.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.500]   This is probably the best slide I can get to it.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.220]   Okay, nope, we lost it.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.300]   Here it is.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.900]   The essence of the literature is how to apply your best self to things that matter most
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:20.100]   to you, things that you deeply value, that are bigger than yourself.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.740]   If you want one takeaway from the whole lecture, if you're going to take a picture of a slide,
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.260]   this is your slide, you're going to it's, it's easier said than done, you're going to
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.420]   apply your best self to things that matter most to you that you really value that are
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.440]   bigger than yourself.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:46.020]   It's a process, it involves how you find purpose, therefore, you start with a purpose, not the
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   purpose.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.100]   So maybe tonight you'll leave and you think you know what, from what she said, people
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.220]   in my life really matter.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.660]   And you'll start devoting more of your time and energy, bringing your best self to people
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.660]   in your life.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.820]   Or maybe you'll say, you know what, social justice really matters, I've been working
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:10.940]   so hard, I've never had the time, I didn't make the time to focus on social justice,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:17.140]   maybe you'll leave tonight and bring your best self to help the LGBTQ community.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.340]   The research gives multiple routes to find purpose.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.700]   And you might find the direct route, what I'm going to go over tonight with you life
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.460]   crafting as the one that's best for you to find your purpose.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.100]   Or perhaps you want to work on other parts of your life such that are known to increase
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.740]   purpose such as your social connections, or maybe you'll do a combination.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.700]   Taking charge of retirement starts with three, I would say really big challenges.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:53.100]   And the first one is you have to reshape your life because it's been governed so long by
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.980]   organizational requirements and external structures, you know, your daily routines, when are you
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   going to go to work?
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.180]   When do you get to come home?
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.980]   What's work time, non work time, who are you going to connect with?
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.660]   And this doesn't just affect you, it affects the others in their life, all of a sudden
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.700]   you're free range person.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.580]   And people can expect a lot of you, especially if you're women, it's domestic or children,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   stuff like that.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:28.300]   The second one, so organizational requirements, you leave behind a goal context.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.620]   And at this stage, you have a more limited future time perspective.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.020]   The research suggests three main pathways that can lead to purpose in life.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:47.900]   So the first pathway is called proactive, because you the person seeks out various opportunities
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.980]   to learn about your purpose, as you're doing here tonight.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:58.220]   And life crafting that I'm going to teach you is in this first proactive category.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.820]   The second one is social learning.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.140]   You know, you've heard of mentoring programs are why I'm going to start BU so you can learn
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.700]   from other people as you do in your bogal head community.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.780]   And the third one is reactive development.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.220]   And all that means is, you can develop a sense of purpose, following a natural occurrence
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.820]   of event, where you noticed you were feeling purpose.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.060]   So all you have to do is pay attention and reflect, but get this.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.500]   The research finds that individuals who report high levels of trying to explore and find
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:40.660]   their purpose in life tend to report greater negative affect and anxiety, needless to say,
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.940]   it's not my goal to make you feel anxious.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:50.740]   So that's why we're going to focus on concrete, specific ways of how you can find your purpose.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.900]   So you can leave tonight with a concrete what next.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.980]   Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to give you the framework, the foundation, all the
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.740]   tools that currently exist in the literature of how to find your purpose, but you have
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.660]   to go home and do the homework.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.120]   If I was doing a class, I'd probably make it a full semester class.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.060]   I would give you weekly homework so I could gradually introduce the concepts and build
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   on them.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.500]   You'd have an individualized homework, you'd come back in a week, and you'd have a group
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:31.300]   of other peers that you could talk to, to figure out what's working, what's not working,
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.100]   what changes do I need, because when you're accountable to others, you're more likely
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.100]   to do it.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.220]   We're not doing a class, so this might be a bit daunting.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.220]   However, you can re-watch this video, you can talk to others, other Bogleheads about
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:54.300]   a specific section, or bring me back for a specific section, but you're going to get
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.460]   tonight Finding Purpose 101 that covers a whole semester.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.460]   Okay?
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.060]   So I'm going to start with some skills.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:09.620]   Now the skills, the six skills I'm going to start with, are evidence-based, but not specifically
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.620]   for purpose.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:18.500]   I tell you them because I've been doing clinical work, research, teaching, about finding success
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.540]   for over 30 years, and these are the skills that people have needed, and when you do life
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.080]   crafting, that you'll need.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.020]   So first of all, you've got to be proactive.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:37.500]   You see something you don't like, you try and fix it, hold on.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.060]   You're proactive about looking for opportunities to be engaged in and contribute to society.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060]   Proactive.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.180]   The next skill is being assertive.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.260]   You go for what you want, what's important to you.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.620]   Now remember, I'm telling you they're skills, that means that you can learn them, you can
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.820]   improve them, you can find out from others, from books, from classes.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.180]   How do I learn to be proactive?
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.100]   How do I learn to be assertive?
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.340]   How do I learn to be analytic and reflective?
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.580]   How do I think about my life and my experiences to figure out what's working, what's not working?
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.100]   What do I want to change?
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.660]   Okay, the next skill is called grit.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:28.700]   Grit is an extreme trait of self-discipline and perseverance.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:37.100]   Grit out predicts IQ for academic success and controlling for education.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.700]   Older people have more grit than younger people.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:49.240]   Those over 65 have more than any other age group, and I tell you this because we have
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.780]   grit to change.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.540]   You might think, "Yeah, my memory is not as great.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.020]   My energy is not as great."
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.020]   That's probably true for this my age.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.380]   However, we have the grit.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:09.260]   If you want to learn computer skills or the piano or how to play pickleball or new social
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.900]   skills, we have the grit to do it and the research to prove it.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.860]   Okay, so let's go to life crafting.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.700]   I'm going to tell you what it is and how you do it.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:30.300]   Life crafting is a process of conscious efforts that you, the individual, make to create meaning
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.140]   in your life.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.460]   The three areas are cognitive crafting.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:43.900]   You're going to start thinking about your life and how you can view it with more meaning.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.300]   You're going to look at your social support systems and use them more to manage your life
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.020]   challenges and to enhance your life.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:03.340]   You're going to seek challenges in terms of facilitating purpose growth, personal growth.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:09.340]   When individuals feel that their lives are connected with something larger than themselves
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.860]   and you're going to hear me keep repeating that, it's larger than yourself, so it's not
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.140]   just you learning computer skills.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:26.100]   Purpose involves contributing to others something larger than yourself that has meaning.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.740]   When individuals feel that their lives are connected with something larger than themselves
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.260]   and they're making a significant contribution to society, they tend to appraise their lives
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.100]   as full of purpose and meaning.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:58.020]   This model of life crafting is the other really good slide I'm presenting, so it gives you
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.940]   the overview and the concepts and individual items that illustrate it.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.140]   If you're going to take a picture, this is your other slide to remember or come back
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.740]   into the presentation.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:16.060]   We start with cognitive crafting, and that's a person making the effort to redefine or
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:22.580]   reframe their life in such a way that it provides meaning.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.940]   The two cognitive crafting strategies are positive thinking.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:33.980]   What I mean by that is you're going through something difficult, and you're looking for
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.740]   how can I get through this the best way I can?
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.660]   How can I contribute to the other people in my life that are going through this hell?
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.700]   How can I help them?
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.900]   That's being positive, but not Pollyannish.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.780]   It's thinking we've got to get through this the best we can.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.820]   How can I make it better?
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.060]   It's transcending your personal goals and thinking about how your life contributes to
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.060]   society.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.420]   I tell you, I'm very much not a Pollyannish person.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   If you find I'm looking, "Jill, I can't think of anything positive in my life or how I'm
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:19.780]   contributing to others," I ask my partner, I ask my friends, "I don't even remember.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.780]   I'm not doing it."
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:26.380]   Okay, if that's really true, then it's probably time you look at your life and see, can I
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:34.540]   make changes so I can have a more positive life?
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.780]   The next category is, oops, there's cognitive crafting.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.260]   The next one's relational crafting.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:49.420]   That's seeking social support to further your purpose in life, or your goals, or enhance
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   it.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   Relationships, if they're mutually beneficial, are the ones that have the most meaning.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:03.820]   In fact, good relationships with others may be the single most important source of life
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.900]   satisfaction and emotional well-being.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   There it is.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   Oops.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   That's the answer.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.900]   Uh-oh, somebody's talking.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.900]   Good relationships with other people.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   Kim?
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.900]   Kim, you're not muted.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.900]   Do you want the question?
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   It's when you're in retirement.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.900]   Single most.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.500]   Can someone help Kim be muted?
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.500]   Don't tell me any of that, but that's what they...
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.580]   Dory, can you help me?
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.460]   Yeah, I'm looking for...
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.540]   Okay, there we go.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.420]   Kim is now muted.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.940]   I'm muted, Emily.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.940]   Thank you.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.940]   Was that Miriam?
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.940]   Yes.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.940]   Whoever did it, thank you very much.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940]   Okay.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.020]   Kim might not appreciate it, but I do.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.020]   Thanks.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020]   Okay.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.260]   So I think I was on relationship crafting.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.260]   Let's see.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.260]   Oops, not challenge.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.260]   We were on relationship crafting.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.260]   Something happened here.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.260]   I'll try and go back.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.260]   Okay.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.260]   Yes, we're there.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.260]   Okay.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   What I was trying to say was good relationships with others may be the single most important
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.260]   source of life satisfaction and emotional well-being and emotional well-being.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.260]   And I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.260]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:33.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:26:13.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:58.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:07.220]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   By retirement,
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.220]   males typically don't have the social skills or structure necessary to have
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   close friends.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.220]   So I know I'm making a broad generalization.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.220]   And it's in the literature.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.220]   It supports.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.220]   Unfortunately that that's true.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.220]   Males have not figured out.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.220]   How to have close relationships and by this age,
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.220]   don't even have this structure.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.220]   And if they're in a heterosexual relationship,
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.220]   they tend to rely on their partner.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   And research that can be problematic.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   So the three relational crafting strategies.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.220]   Are creating new relationships.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.220]   Improving your current ones.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.220]   And you using.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   The social resource.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   Your social resources better. I see.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.220]   I'm not on this one and I don't think I touched anything.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.220]   So we're still on relation.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   Look, see, it's going goofy on me.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.220]   Oh dear.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.220]   We're still on relational.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   Crafting.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.220]   So actually, you know,
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   when I was doing a class for Boston university on successful retirement,
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:28.220]   I had a group of people.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   And they wanted to see the problems that were arising as they
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.220]   consider retirement. And that was a group.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   Of only one person who've retired. Everyone was still employed.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.220]   And it went even to age 20. And they were saying, please, we,
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.220]   we want a whole section on it.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.220]   Social support is so important. Maybe you've seen this new trend.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.220]   They're called happy to chat benches.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   It started in the UK and it's moving to other countries.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   And it's a.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:58.220]   It's a new trend.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   Benches. This is funny. They're now lines on my screen.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.220]   I don't know what's happening here.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   And they're marked.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.220]   To get people to engage with one another,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.220]   whether it's a light chit chat or something deeper.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   Anything to help reduce the sense of isolation and loneliness.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.220]   Okay. So now we really are going to go on to.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:26.220]   The next slide.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   How do people grow and develop themselves?
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.220]   And that's at the core of most meeting baking strategies.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.220]   People want to personal growth.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.220]   Achievement and accomplishment.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.220]   Especially including at this age.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   We don't want to be the national resource that's left behind.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   We want to be the resource that's left behind.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   And we want to be the resource that's left behind.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.220]   We want to be the resource that's left behind.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.220]   So what I'm going to share with you now.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.220]   Are the seven areas that get addressed and you'll see why.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:06.220]   It would be so good if we were in a class.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.220]   And we could thoroughly go over each one of these.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.220]   However, you'll have the information and.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.220]   Either contact each other or maybe me.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.220]   And say, I mean, we'll help. How can we do this? Okay.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.220]   Let's talk about values and passions.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   What do you like to do?
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.220]   What kind of relationships would you like to have?
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:30.220]   How do you want to engage your mind?
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   Now, in terms of values and passions,
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   if you look at the literature on transitions.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.220]   When people go through big transitions.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.220]   They find out they have.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:47.220]   They find out they graduated from college.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.220]   Or they had a child when people go through transitions.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   They tend to reevaluate and change.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   Their.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   Values sometimes anyway.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   The recent literature,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   the 2023 literature on retirement says we don't change our values.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   We might tweak them.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.220]   But we don't change our values.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.220]   So you can use them as a basis for figuring out.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.220]   What purpose I want.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.220]   So first thing are your values and passions.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.220]   The second one are your competencies and habits.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   Think of qualities you like about yourself.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.220]   And qualities you don't like about yourself.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.220]   And if it's too hard to think about yourself, you can't get distance.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.220]   Think about other people, you know,
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.220]   what is it about them that you like?
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   What is it about them?
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   You don't admire to start thinking about these individual behaviors
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.220]   and habits or competencies you want.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.220]   Think about your social life. It's back to social life.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.220]   My, a lot of you might leave thinking.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   I never even thought that was important.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   We never learned about that in school.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   Okay.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.220]   And then the last one is your purpose.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   Meaning health.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   Well-being and your purpose.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   So think about when you're at your best self.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.220]   What kind of friend or family member would you like to be?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   And again, if you can't think about yourself or that's not your skill.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.220]   Think about someone in your life.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   And it could be someone at a distance that you.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   You once knew through work.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.220]   Or it could be a family member. It could be a kid.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.220]   It could be a friend.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.220]   It could be a family member.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   It could be a friend.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   It could be a person that you want to be around.

[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.220]   and doing something
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   bigger than just yourself.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.220]   So when you figure out
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.220]   what you want to do,
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.220]   what you want to implement,
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.220]   it's important to set goals.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.220]   You do better
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   if you set goals
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.220]   rather than just say, "I'm going to do my best."
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.220]   You have a better outcome
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.220]   by setting goals.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   I'll tell you the acronym for setting goals
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.220]   are SMART goals.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.220]   You want your goals
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.220]   to be specific,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.220]   measurable,
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.220]   attainable,
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.220]   realistic,
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.220]   and timely.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.220]   I'm going to give you an example of Arthur.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   Arthur retired from Google
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.220]   when he was 47.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   He did not grow up wealthy.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.220]   He was fortunate enough to keep working
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   with startups. He's an engineer.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   He ends up at Google
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   in the first handful of people.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.220]   Thanks to Arthur,
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   he's largely
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.220]   responsible for
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.220]   us having text messaging,
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.220]   one of the important people.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.220]   Because of that, he was able
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   to retire. People had
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   always told him, "If you have the
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.220]   chance to be with their children when
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.220]   they're young, take that chance."
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.220]   He and his wife, also
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   a professional, took that chance
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.220]   to be with their young child.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.220]   What he was telling me,
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.220]   he was concerned about retiring
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   because he loved
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.220]   his work at Google, and
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.220]   he was afraid that he would lose his
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   friendships, and especially
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.220]   friends who like talking computers.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   He's
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   a very informed person,
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   and he has good reason to worry. That's what
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   people often say. What do they miss
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   about their work? Their social
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.220]   connections.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   He cares deeply for his friendships.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.220]   Google is very
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   different from academia. In academia,
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.220]   I'm encouraged
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.220]   to work with my colleagues,
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.220]   to do research with them, to present
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.220]   with them, to teach with them.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   At Google, you're out,
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.220]   and you're out. They don't want you to know
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   their secrets. Even when
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.220]   I was presenting to Google,
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.220]   and Arthur was significant in my
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.220]   research, they weren't going to let him
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.220]   come, but we found a workaround
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.220]   because
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.220]   I insisted.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   Anyway,
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.220]   they recorded it and
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   blasted it to all their satellites
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   as I presented, and then they wouldn't even put
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.220]   it on YouTube. They want others to,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.220]   but they're very private
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   about their information.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   Arthur being
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.220]   Arthur, he's a very planful
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   person. He thought, "Okay,
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.220]   I'm going to put the conditions in
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.220]   place before I retire.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.220]   I'm going to figure out what my goals are
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.220]   with friendship. What tasks
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   do I need to do? What do I want
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   a typical day to look like?"
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   He implements before
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.220]   he retires. He was also
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.220]   talking to me. He did that for his friendships.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   He did it for his tech skills.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.220]   I have
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.220]   spoken to him over the years with
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.220]   follow-up. Originally, when
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   he was retiring, he thought, "I will
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.220]   probably go back to work in five years."
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.220]   Now, it's over 10 years ago.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.220]   He has no desire to go back
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.220]   to work. He finds life
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.220]   meaningful. He can do
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.220]   projects that he actually can complete.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.220]   Google sometimes at the last
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   minute would take them away from you.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   He was happy to have
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.220]   that kind of control.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.220]   He does
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.220]   computer projects that are
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.220]   meaningful for large
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.220]   numbers of people, not the same scale
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   as Google, but still very
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   meaningful. His friendships
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.220]   are better. He's made it a priority
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.220]   to keep up his close
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.220]   friendships, which he couldn't do as
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.220]   well when he worked, including his
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.220]   friends at Google and his friends
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.220]   from the East Coast at MIT.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.220]   His friendships are better, and
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   he loves volunteering with his
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.220]   wife in his child's school.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   He found ways
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.220]   to have meaning in
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   retirement.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   When you're doing your goals, it's
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   better to focus on learning
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.220]   about your performance.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   For example, if you leave here
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   and you think, "Gee, I do
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.220]   need to work on making friends," it's
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.220]   better to think about learning
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.220]   about the process
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.220]   of making friends and saying,
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.220]   "I'm going to have three friends in the next
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.220]   month." Don't go for the numbers.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.220]   Go for the process, the learning.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.220]   Or perhaps you're saying,
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.220]   "It's time I do
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.220]   volunteer and contribute back."
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   Don't say, "I'm going to have a position
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.220]   where you can start
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.220]   even tonight looking for
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   what positions are available, how
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.220]   you can do it, or people you know
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.220]   that have been involved in volunteering.
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.220]   How did they do it?"
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.220]   I'll give you another example.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.220]   Elliot Aronson, also a very eminent
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.220]   psychologist in
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.220]   the field. Maybe you've heard of the concept
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.220]   cognitive dissonance. That's
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.220]   Elliot. I interviewed him in his
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   80s, and he told
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.220]   me before he retired
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.220]   when he was teaching and doing research,
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   he found out he was going blind,
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.220]   and he was very proactive. He learned to
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.220]   walk with a white cane. He got
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.220]   a seeing eye dog. He made his
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.220]   computer able to read to him
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.220]   so he could continue with his research,
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   but he gave up his teaching
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.220]   because he couldn't see his students.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.220]   Since we were
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.220]   doing this interview, we decided to teach
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.220]   together. I would be his eyes.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.220]   From that experience,
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.220]   he remembered how much
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.220]   he liked teaching, and he found new
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.220]   skills. At age 80,
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.220]   Elliot went back to teaching, too.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.220]   For those of you that have
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.220]   accomplished goals,
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   you've probably noticed, you've had this
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   experience of, in a way, it's easier
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.220]   to accomplish a goal than
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.220]   maintain the status quo. Just
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.220]   think about losing weight, how many people actually
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.220]   lose weight and gain back more,
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.220]   how many people start physical
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.220]   activity and quit. It's
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.220]   easier to set a goal,
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.220]   reach the goal, than it is to
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.220]   continue on the
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   status quo. This I'm
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.220]   making up, but I think it's a
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   good idea. It's
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.220]   not evidence-based. When you reach
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.220]   your goal, tweak your goal
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.220]   so you have something else to
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.220]   work towards, whether it's weight,
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.220]   whether it's physical activity, whether it's
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   learning the computer, whether it's how much
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.220]   you're going to contribute on that
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.220]   volunteer position. You have a goal,
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.220]   tweak it when you get there
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.220]   so that you can keep
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.220]   your interest in the challenge.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.220]   I'm going to give you an example of Leslie.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   Leslie
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.220]   retired in her 60s when I
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.220]   interviewed her. She's
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.220]   a very responsible person. She had a
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.220]   very high position in mental health,
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.220]   and she took a lower
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.220]   high position because she knew she was going to
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.220]   retire. She did all the things I'm
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.220]   telling you to plan for her
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.220]   retirement. She knew exactly what she
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.220]   and her husband were going to do, and boom,
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   everything changes. Right before
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   she retires, he dies
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.220]   and her dog dies. Leslie
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.220]   did not have close friendships.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.220]   She felt close to her children
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.220]   and they lived far away.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.220]   What Leslie did, instead
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   of having long-term
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   goals, she reordered her
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   thinking and thought, "Okay, I've got
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.220]   to get through the day. I'm going to
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.220]   plan each day."
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   She thought, "What's important to me? What
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.220]   elements do I want in my day?"
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.220]   She thought of five elements
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   that every day she would want to
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   figure out. Physical activity,
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   social connection,
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.220]   meditation, creativity,
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.220]   and for her, that could just be cooking
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.220]   or music, and service to others.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.220]   People from my
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   presentations or classes have found
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.220]   her way of approaching
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.220]   each day can be very
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.220]   helpful for you, and then you can tweak
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   what the elements you want.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.220]   Approach goals are
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.220]   better than avoidance goals.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.220]   What I mean is, don't think
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.220]   that, "Gee, I don't want to be bored.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.220]   I don't want to be lonely." Think
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   about, "Okay,
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.220]   I want to work on finding a volunteer
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.220]   position or making friends."
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   Think of something you can approach
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.220]   that's a better goal
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.220]   and you'll be more successful than
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.220]   thinking what you want to avoid.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.220]   When you're discovering
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.220]   your purpose, people tend to
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.220]   say, "Well, what do I like?"
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   That can be useful,
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.220]   but asking yourself what's
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.220]   important to you is actually
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.220]   better at finding purpose
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.220]   and maintaining it. It's
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.220]   bigger than you and can help
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.220]   you when things aren't going well.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   You may not know what your
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.220]   interest or your passion is. Try
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.220]   something. People do well at
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   something, it can become a passion.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.220]   Maybe you had no interest in
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.220]   photography or writing stories
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.220]   or working with foster kids.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.220]   Maybe you try something
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   and you find, "Wow,
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.220]   I'm good at this. I like this.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.220]   I want to do more of it. I want to help people."
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.220]   Just start
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   trying things. Of course,
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   the literature, you know this, that
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.220]   a lifestyle that involves physical
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.220]   activity,
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.220]   there's an abundance of
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.220]   literature that it's good for your physical
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.220]   and mental health. I would suggest
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.220]   that, you know how I tell you being
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.220]   accountable is good? Do your
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.220]   physical activity with
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   others or for others.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.220]   Then you're doing several things
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.220]   at the same time of those seven
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.220]   categories. You're going to involve
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.220]   others. Maybe you say, "Okay, I'm going to get
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   physically active. I'm going to involve my
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   friends or my neighbors
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   or other... I'm going to go to
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.220]   assisted living place.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.220]   Or maybe I'm going to do it with
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.220]   foster kids. I'm going to be the one that can
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.220]   take them out to play basketball
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.220]   or miniature golf or for
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   walks, whatever it is.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.220]   Or with my dog, they can
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.220]   walk with me. Or maybe
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.220]   you'll even think a little bigger and you'll
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.220]   do a fundraiser for the foster
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.220]   care or for somebody else.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.220]   You'll get people to be active
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   with you. You'll be accountable. You'll be
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.220]   helping them and maybe you'll do it
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.220]   for even a bigger cause.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.220]   It's better to have no calling
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   than an unfulfilled calling.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   What I mean by that is
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.220]   to set a goal
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.220]   and not reach it is worse than
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.220]   having no goals. That's why
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.220]   I want you to think about new things you
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.220]   want to do and before you
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.220]   leave tonight, think about, "Okay."
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.220]   She keeps saying it. "What can I
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.220]   implement by tomorrow morning
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.220]   or by the end of tomorrow day or even
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.220]   tonight? What can I start doing?"
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.220]   Implement. It doesn't have to be
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.220]   the right thing. It's not the purpose.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.220]   It's a purpose.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.220]   And
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.220]   okay.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.220]   Remember I said a
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.220]   purpose, not the purpose.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.220]   People who are called
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   satisficers, they
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   think things are good enough.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   They have better health and well-being
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.220]   than people who are maximizers, people
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   that think, "I have to find the perfect
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.220]   volunteer position or the
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.220]   perfect list." They are not
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.220]   as happy or successful as the people
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.220]   that think, "I need to find something
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.220]   good enough."
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.220]   Okay. So I already
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.220]   told you that about your ideal life.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.220]   Last, I just have two little things
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.220]   to end. When you're having
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.220]   a new habit, say you're
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.220]   going to start flossing, typically
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.220]   it can take one to two or
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.220]   three months to develop a new habit.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.220]   So as you try these new
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.220]   things, give them time.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.220]   You might want to tweak them. You might want
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.220]   support from others,
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.220]   but keep at it for
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.220]   a while. New habits don't develop
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.220]   quickly.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.220]   I want to end with something that
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.220]   actually is not evidence-based,
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.220]   but I consider it
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.220]   poignant and helpful.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.220]   Bronnie Ware is
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.220]   a nurse to patients who are dying,
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.220]   and she writes
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.220]   about regrets from people
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.220]   who are dying, because that's
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   who she's working with, and that's what they're
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.220]   talking to her about.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.220]   So I ask you before I tell
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.220]   you the number one regret,
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.220]   something that you'd want to
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.220]   think about is, "Is there anything
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.220]   I've always wanted to do and I don't
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.220]   want to run out of the resources
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   or the time or the
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.220]   health to do it?"
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   What is that? Maybe you
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.220]   can do it. Anyway, the number one
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.220]   regret that she finds,
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.220]   okay, punchline
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.220]   here, if I can get to it.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.220]   Oops, elements, physical
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   activity, sorry. Okay, the
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.220]   number one regret is,
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.220]   "I wish I had the courage
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.220]   to live a life true to
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.220]   myself, not the
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.220]   life others expected of me."
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.220]   Another, this is probably the last
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.220]   slide you might want to copy.
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.220]   "I wish I had the courage
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.220]   to live a life true to myself,
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.220]   not the life others
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.220]   expected of me." And I,
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.220]   Jill, wish you the courage
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.220]   and support to live a life
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.220]   that has purpose for you.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.220]   Thank you. So that's it.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.220]   That's what I do. Okay, 5.58.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.220]   We have time for
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.220]   a few questions.
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.220]   And Jim, you can give me any feedback
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:21.220]   or tell me if people are still
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.220]   there and if they had any questions.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.220]   Yeah, we had over
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.220]   100 people or 99
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.220]   people show up. And a few
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.220]   people have just recently dropped out, but
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.220]   very good turnout for sure.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.220]   Thank you. Great. And
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.220]   we have, somebody
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.220]   had made a comment that they're 57,
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.220]   self-employed for 36 years in a field
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.220]   that they love, but COVID
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.220]   has made the work vanished
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.220]   and the work has not
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.220]   come back. They're in
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.220]   terrific financial shape, but not ready
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   to retire. The university,
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.220]   sorry, the universe has apparently
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.220]   decided it's retirement
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.220]   time, but what can I do?
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.220]   Even another five or eight
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.220]   years would be nice. So I just,
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.220]   maybe you could comment on that.
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.220]   Well,
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.220]   I guess my first comment is, I'm
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.220]   sorry, because
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.220]   going through COVID
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.220]   for many of us
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.220]   and still going through COVID has been
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.220]   a very difficult time.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.220]   And the situation you're describing
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.220]   is not unusual.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.220]   And if you look at the literature
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.220]   on successful
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.220]   retirement, being
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.220]   forced in retirement is not a
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.220]   good predictor of success.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.220]   However, you just
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.220]   heard an entire
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.220]   lecture on no matter where
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.220]   you're at, you can find
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.220]   purpose, and that's very good for your
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.220]   mental and physical health.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:47.220]   So what I would do, first
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.220]   of all, if you want to, you can go back to my
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.220]   other lecture, but I think this
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.220]   is the one you need. Let's look for
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.220]   a purpose for you.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.220]   And if I was talking
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.220]   with you, I would start with those seven
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.220]   areas, like
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.220]   what do you value? What do you
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.220]   like doing? What's important
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.220]   to you? Let's find that and go
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.220]   through the seven areas.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.220]   I went through to think, "Okay,
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.220]   I'm going to try this." Or maybe
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.220]   it's just easy for you. You go,
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.220]   "You know what? I've worked so hard.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.220]   I love my work. I don't really
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.220]   have that many close people in
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   my life." And she just said, "If
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.220]   I'm in a heterosexual relationship,
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.220]   it's not a good thing to just rely
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   on my female partner."
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.220]   And you can
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.220]   look at my research on my website.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.220]   It's problematic. So maybe
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.220]   you think, "Gee, that's really
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.220]   important. I don't even know
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.220]   how to start, but I'm going to start looking
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.220]   at how do you make friendships?"
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.220]   And they're very
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.220]   good books.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.220]   One of the best people in the field
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.220]   about the importance of social connection
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.220]   was University of Chicago.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.220]   And he died in the
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.220]   last year. So if anybody can think of his
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.220]   name, if not, if that's important to you,
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.220]   we'll get back to you. But go University
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.220]   of Chicago Social Connection.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.220]   It's an unusual name.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.220]   It was an excellent book on loneliness,
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.220]   but you might not be feeling lonely,
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.220]   and that's not the point. The point is
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.220]   about social connection.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.220]   So you could start with anything
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.220]   here. It doesn't have to be the right
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.220]   thing. Did I bring up anything
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.220]   to you, that person,
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.220]   that feels like, "Okay,
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   I just want to get in gear
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.220]   and start something." So I
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.220]   know, Jim,
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220]   do you feel like that was
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.220]   helpful? Because I'm repeating
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.220]   what I said. You
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.220]   do? Okay. Yeah, and we have another question
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.220]   from Art. Dr. Steinberg,
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.220]   do you think it's more difficult for Americans
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.220]   to deal with this issue because of the way
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.220]   our society, work, retirement,
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.220]   and its ties to money and position
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.220]   are set up versus a country
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.220]   like Japan, who has
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.220]   a purpose as part of the culture?
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   That, I
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   can't
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220]   answer that because I
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.220]   haven't read the research.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.220]   If you ask my gut reaction,
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.220]   I think it's very difficult
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.220]   in this society to
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.220]   do well in retirement.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.220]   As I said,
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   at best, 75%
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.220]   of people enjoy
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.220]   their retirement, and that's of the people
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.220]   that choose it, that
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.220]   are privileged
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.220]   enough to have the finances,
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.220]   the health, to even
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.220]   retire.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.220]   That's a crappy
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.220]   statistic. That's
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.220]   barely a C.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.220]   We're not doing that well.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.220]   I don't know the statistics of Japan,
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.220]   but when I read about
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.220]   that, when you have more
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.220]   community and thinking about the
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.220]   others they profess, that gives
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.220]   you more a sense of purpose.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.220]   It sounds
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.220]   good to me, and
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.220]   I wish we would develop
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.220]   -- we wouldn't be such an individualistic
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.220]   society because at the
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.220]   end of the day, the end of the research,
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.220]   that's not what
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.220]   making people happy and
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.220]   healthy.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.220]   It's my best guess.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.220]   Okay. We have another
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   comment. "Great talk. You mentioned that
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.220]   you're going to start a mentoring program.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   When do you plan to do that, and
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.220]   how could one join a mentoring program?"
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.220]   Right now,
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.220]   it's through Boston
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.220]   University. If you're an alumni
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.220]   of BU, you can join it.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.220]   We won't start it probably
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.220]   for about two months.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.220]   We just recently did a survey at
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.220]   my last presentation, and
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.220]   we have enough interest
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.220]   that people would want it.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220]   Right now, I am developing
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.220]   the retiree
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   to retiree mentor program.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.220]   The only other
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.220]   few I know in the whole country,
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.220]   because I've scoured the research.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.220]   Emory University,
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.220]   if you've been a part of that.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.220]   Oh, and too,
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.220]   the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.220]   just has
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.220]   a network where you can see who else
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.220]   retired, but they don't do --
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.220]   I'm going to train people
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   to be mentors
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.220]   and
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.220]   mentees, how to be mentees
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.220]   and match them and start it.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.220]   I did a very successful
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.220]   program at San Jose
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.220]   State University, but that was
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.220]   student-to-student.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.220]   If you look into literature on mentoring,
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.220]   it's a very
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.220]   successful thing.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.220]   That's how. If you're a BU alum,
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.220]   you've made it that way.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.220]   If not,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.220]   I don't know where else in the rest of
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.220]   your life there's not much literature
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.220]   on retiree-to-retiree
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.220]   mentoring. Maybe Bogleheads could
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.220]   do something, but I know your
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.220]   focus is more financial,
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.220]   or I am
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.220]   setting up the
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.220]   parameters for training right
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.220]   now, so perhaps you live
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.220]   in a community where you'd
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   like that, and they'd ask me to
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.220]   consult on what
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.220]   we could do to start our own
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.220]   mentoring program. Anyway,
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.220]   that's how it's going, and it's a very new
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.220]   thing, and I'm proud of BU
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.220]   because when they started working with me
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   about 10 years ago, really, the
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   Association did not focus on
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.220]   our age and stage, and
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.220]   we were so successful
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.220]   at getting huge amounts of people
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.220]   to attend that
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.220]   they've now started this whole initiative
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   for our age. We
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.220]   want to be involved.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.220]   We want to be a resource.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.220]   Jim, how are we doing
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.220]   with time? I could easily
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220]   end. I've talked a lot,
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.220]   and I don't know if people
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.220]   are okay if we end.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.220]   We have a couple
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.220]   more comments, and I'll just -- somebody
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.220]   commented about the literature
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.220]   you mentioned and maybe a suggested reading
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.220]   list. Maybe we could get together
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.220]   later, like tomorrow, next day, and
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.220]   put a list together and then
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.220]   publish it with the chat notes that we
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.220]   are going to publish. That would be all right with you?
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   If you ask that person,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.220]   I don't know, just put it out, and
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.220]   maybe they could respond.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.220]   The whole thing is evidence-based,
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.220]   so was there something in
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   particular you would
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.220]   like? Since it was me
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.220]   and I was going to go to something
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.220]   to start from this,
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   particularly that person that says, "What am I
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.220]   going to do with my life now?"
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.220]   Go to Seligman. Go
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.220]   to watch a TED Talk by
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.220]   Seligman on Flourish. Go to
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.220]   the University of Pennsylvania website.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.220]   That's a quick, easy
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.220]   -- you can do it tonight.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.220]   He's excellent. He's all
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.220]   evidence-based on interventions,
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.220]   too. If there's
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.220]   somebody in particular
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.220]   they want,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.220]   if they could put it in the
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.220]   chat from all that I presented,
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.220]   what is it?
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.220]   If it's about
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.220]   successful retirement, like I brought
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.220]   up issues with couples or
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.220]   planning or those kinds
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220]   of things I illustrated people,
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.220]   you could go to my website.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.220]   On my website, myretirementworks.com,
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.220]   there's a
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.220]   section called Research. It's
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.220]   not as up-to-date as
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   my chapter, but you don't need to
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.220]   buy this book unless you're interested
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.220]   in all aspects of
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   the psychology and
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.220]   economics of the aging consumer.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.220]   A lot of what's in this
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.220]   chapter is on my website, and
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   all the resources
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.220]   are there. You
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.220]   could go there tonight.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.220]   That's a really good start.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.220]   Or you will let Jim know
