[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Most of you will remember that we are dealing at the moment with the words found in Paul's
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.400]   epistle to the Romans in chapter 11 from verse 18 to the end of the 22nd verse. Verses 18
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.880]   to 22 in the 11th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. "Boast not against the branches,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.120]   but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, 'The
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.400]   branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.' Well, because of unbelief they were broken
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:45.800]   off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear, for if God spared not the natural
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.280]   branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.440]   on them which fell severity, but toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness;
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.840]   otherwise thou also shalt be cut off." Now, this is the most important statement,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.040]   one of these great crucial statements that are to be found scattered about in the pages
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.000]   of Holy Writ, and this is an unusually important one for many, many reasons. We've spent some time
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.680]   in expounding it. I mean by that in showing the exact meaning of the words and what the statement
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.960]   is in general. And then we have started a consideration of the teaching of this passage.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.280]   I suggested you could divide it into four sectionsâ€”exposition, teaching, the problem raised,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.160]   and general application, especially at this present time. Now, we are at the moment looking
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.800]   at the teaching. And last Friday night we saw that the teaching here, in the first instance, is this,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.880]   that our greatest danger, always, as long as we are in this world, even as Christian people,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.760]   is our pride, our false conceit of ourselves leading to pride. And we saw how the apostle
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.000]   deals with it and teaches us how to deal with it and how to answer it.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.680]   The second thing we saw in the teaching was that the apostle emphasizes the constant need
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:43.800]   of humility, the need indeed of watchfulness and of fear. He says, "Be not high-minded, but fear."
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   Now he's addressing Christian people, remember. That is what he says to them, "Be not high-minded,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:01.720]   but fear." And he goes on repeating this warning to them to be careful and to watch
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:12.760]   and to take heed as we look at ourselves and consider ourselves in the economy of God.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:23.240]   The fundamental theme, you see, is the Christian church and the respective positions and relations
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.960]   of the Jews and the Gentiles in that church. He's been telling them that the first branches,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:38.760]   the natural branches, were the Jews. But at this time they'd been broken up and the Gentiles had
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.360]   been grafted in. And because of that, this terrible danger had arisen for the Gentiles to lose their
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.280]   heads, to be proud of themselves, to boast as against the Jews and to say they were taken out
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.640]   in order that we might be put in. In other words, the danger of falling into the very error into
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.280]   which the Jews themselves had fallen. Their trouble was, they said, "We are the people of God."
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.400]   Nothing else mattered. They felt there was something peculiar and special about themselves
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.080]   and in their foolish boasting as Jews, they were outside the kingdom of God. Now the Gentiles
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.680]   attempted to do exactly the same thing. And that is why this teaching is so important. It's a
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   danger that always besets us. I put it like this last Friday, that we've always got to keep our
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.560]   eye on justification by works. Even though we believe in justification by faith, intellectually,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.360]   we find that constantly this other enemy tries to be insinuating his way back again into our
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.280]   thinking. We've always got to be watchful and fearful of that very thing. Now then, we come now
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.720]   to the third strand, if you like, in the teaching which the apostle gives us at this point.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.600]   And I'll put it like this. He tells us that the best corrective against pride, and all that
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   accompanies pride, the best corrective against pride, or if you prefer it, our greatest need
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:16.600]   always, is to know God, to know the character of God, to know the truth about God. Now this
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.000]   is the message of this great twenty-second verse. "Behold therefore," this is the antidote to boast
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.600]   not against the branches, this is the way to do so, "behold therefore the goodness and the severity
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.840]   of God." Now this is what I want to consider with you in particular this evening.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.760]   What is this teaching? Well, putting it generally, we can put it like this.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.160]   The whole of our thinking should always be controlled
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:04.440]   by our knowledge of God, by the truth concerning God. That's to be the controlling factor
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   in our whole outlook, in all our thinking, in everything we do.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.400]   It's all to be dominated and controlled by thoughts of God.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:24.760]   In other words, our greatest need is to know God as he has revealed himself to us in the scriptures.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:32.360]   And if we have that knowledge, it will save us from most of our troubles.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.440]   That's what he's laying down here as a proposition.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:47.000]   Or I'll put that in its negative form. Our greatest lack as Christian people, always,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   is the lack of a knowledge of God. Now that sounds almost incredible, doesn't it? But it's the truth,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.600]   it's the very thing the apostle is saying here. These Gentiles were falling into this temptation
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:09.000]   to boast against the branches simply because they were ignorant of God. And this is the main cause
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.960]   of most of our troubles and problems. So I put it positively by saying that the greater the extent
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:25.080]   of our knowledge of God, the freer we shall be in our thinking, in our practice, in every respect,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.960]   from problems and troubles and failures and sin and final tragedy.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.040]   Now, if this is always true, and it is of course the fundamental teaching of the whole of the Bible,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:45.240]   I feel that it is especially true at this present time in which you and I are living. And never
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.280]   have we had a greater need of the exhortation with which this 22nd verse opens. "Behold therefore,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:03.560]   the goodness and the severity of God." Let's look at this. That's what makes this passage,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.200]   as I say, such a crucial one, such an all-important one. Thank God that the great apostle with his
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.840]   pastoral heart turned aside from the mere statement of prophetic truth, if you like,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.760]   to apply it to these Gentiles. For we need it above everything else. Let me put it like this to
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   you. Let me show you, first of all, some of the ways in which our failure to realize the truth
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:42.200]   about God manifests itself in us. Now, the first thing it does is this. It manifests itself even
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:49.880]   with respect to our doctrine. If we don't start with this knowledge of God, and if the knowledge
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.360]   of God and the truth about God isn't there overarching everything we do and are as Christian
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.120]   people, the first respect in which it's likely to show itself is in the realm of doctrine.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:09.800]   How a very doctrine is going to suffer. Now, this again may come as a surprise to some of you.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.720]   You may say, "Well, I'm a Christian and therefore my doctrine is all right. It doesn't follow at
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.800]   all." If that were true, you wouldn't have an epistle to the Romans, and you wouldn't have
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.920]   any other epistle. The idea that the moment you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you've got
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.200]   perfect doctrine and you're immune from error is, of course, of all the fallacies, the most
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   dangerous of all. The New Testament is proof positive that because we start the Christian
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   life as babes and as children, we are all as liable as Paul puts it to the Ephesians,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   to be carried about by every wind of doctrine. We are liable to go astray. And there is even a
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   phrase which talks about making shipwreck of the faith, apart from this tremendous warning here.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:00.760]   "Goodness toward thee, if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.400]   Now then, how does it affect itself, manifest itself in the matter of doctrine? Well,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:16.840]   I would start by putting it like this. The first way in which it shows itself is in a tendency to
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.880]   ignore God altogether. But you say, "Surely that's impossible. That's impossible in a Christian."
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:32.360]   Is it? Isn't it the case that so many Christian people today never seem to think nor to speak of
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.840]   God the Father? They talk only about the Lord Jesus Christ, and they pray to him.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:48.200]   You rarely hear some Christian people mentioning God the Father. Their thinking seems to be
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:55.640]   entirely concentrated on the Lord Jesus Christ, to the exclusion of God the Father. It's an
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.560]   amazing thing, but it's true. That's one of the ways then in which it manifests itself,
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.600]   that he is rarely forgotten. If you ask them if they believe in God, of course they'll say they
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.560]   do. But I'm saying that in their normal thinking, they never think about God at all. The doctrine
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.680]   of the Trinity has been a stumbling block to Christian people from the beginning. All sorts
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.920]   of heresies have arisen with respect to this. I would have thought that this is the common one
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.040]   at the present time. I have sometimes described it as a kind of Jesus-olatry, which excludes the
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   Father altogether in its thinking. And it's the most terrible thing. Well, there's the first.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   Or secondly, it may manifest itself like this, and this again is so common,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.920]   that if they do think of God and speak about him, their view of God is a false one.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.400]   It's not the true view of God, it's not the biblical view of God.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.800]   Now, you are aware of how common that is at the present time.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.720]   These people who tell us repeatedly that God is love, nothing else, only love,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.720]   they really have constructed a God of their own, that is, idolatry. The very thing against which
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.040]   God, through his servant Moses, warned the children of Israel, would have such signal
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.640]   manifestations of God and his power and his glory. The thing that Moses has to warn them
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:27.320]   above everything else is the danger of falling into idolatry. And it is a constant danger.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:34.040]   You don't take the God who has revealed himself in the scriptures, but you have your own
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.080]   philosophical ideas of God. You say, "I can't believe in a God who does this or that." You
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:45.240]   know, that's idolatry. You've constructed your own God. You've got wrong ideas and views of God.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:52.360]   This is most common, I think you'll all agree. And then going on to a third way in which our
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.720]   thinking is affected of necessity if we don't start with God, and if God doesn't control
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.240]   the whole of the thinking, is that we will have a false view of sin.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:09.240]   And we will have a false view of man in sin. Now, what is your definition of sin?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:16.440]   I think you'll find that very often we tend to think of sin simply as something wrong which we
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.880]   do, and that's all. Something which makes us unhappy afterwards and leads to remorse,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:28.440]   and so on. Or sin as a man letting himself down, or failing to live up to his own moral code and
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:36.360]   ideas, and so on. Or sin as a sort of a sickness and almost a disease. But it's thought of entirely
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:45.720]   in terms of men. Whereas obviously in the Bible sin is always defined in terms of God.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:54.120]   Sin is transgression of the law. Sin is disobedience to God. But if you don't start with God,
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.520]   your view of sin of necessity is going to be a wrong view. And in turn, as I say, under this
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:09.480]   heading, our view of men in sin is also false and defective. Now this is clear speaking generally
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.440]   of the Christian church at the present time. Views of sin are discounted even. They don't
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.520]   like the whole notion. They say they can explain it away psychologically, and men in sin, we are
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.160]   told, must not be thought of as evil. It's a terrible thing we are told to do that. We mustn't
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.200]   do that. Man just is a bit ignorant. He still doesn't know as much as he should know, and
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:36.360]   he's only got to be encouraged, and so on. The whole view of men in sin is involved.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:44.040]   The idea of men as a lost, condemned, hopeless sinner is not common today. And it's simply due
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:54.120]   to the fact that they haven't started with God. In the same way, of course, it leads to a false
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.880]   view of the atonement. All these things hang together. That's the extraordinary thing about
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.480]   biblical truth and biblical teaching and biblical doctrine. It's a complete whole. And if you're
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.600]   seriously wrong at one point, it'll affect all the rest. And if you're wrong at this preliminary,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.800]   first point, fundamental postulate, well, you're going to be wrong right along the line. The result
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.880]   is that the ideas of the atonement today are so tragically removed from what you get in the Bible.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.240]   They dislike this notion of sacrifice. Let me give you an instance. I have it in my mind,
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.960]   as it only happened to me this very week. The popular idea today of the atonement is this,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:40.280]   as you know. How often has it been said by a certain type of popular preacher,
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:47.560]   that what's happening on the cross is that the Lord Jesus Christ is saying there, "Though you
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.920]   do this to me, I still love you. Though you're even putting me to death, I still love you."
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.080]   Or they sometimes put it like this, that it's God, the Father, who's speaking, and what he's
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.440]   saying on the cross is this, "Though you're murdering my only begotten Son, I still love you."
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.200]   That's the popular view of the atonement today, of the meaning of the death of our Lord
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   upon the cross. Indeed, there is no atonement there, but they call it the doctrine of the
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   atonement, and that once we realize this, it'll break our hearts, and we'll just thank God for
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.480]   his love. Now, I say I had an experience which brought this to me very forcibly this week. I
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   was preaching in a certain place, and at the end of one of my services, a young curate came to me,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.720]   and spoke to me, and showed me something. He is still continuing a certain amount of training,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:46.040]   and he'd had to write an essay for his examiner in his particular diocese on this whole question
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.360]   of the death of Christ and the doctrine of the atonement. And he'd done so. He was a good
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.720]   evangelical young man, but he showed me what his examiner had said. He had said this, that this
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.680]   idea that God had punished our sins in the person of his own Son was not only wrong, not only
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:10.600]   immoral, he called it near blasphemy. Now, there's only one explanation of it. The trouble with that
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:20.920]   examiner is his conception of God. He doesn't believe in the God of the Bible. He's an idolater.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.880]   He's worshipping a God who has been created by the philosophers. The philosopher's God is always
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:34.200]   a God of love and nothing else. And so, the doctrine of the atonement goes by the book.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.760]   And in the same way, with this wrong idea of God and the character of God,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:49.960]   there's no need of regeneration. You just accept forgiveness, and you go on eventually to heaven,
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.480]   and all is well. They don't realize that because God is what God is, no man can possibly
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.880]   enjoy heaven unless he's been born again and has a new nature within him. So, all that goes.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.640]   And just to complete my list, you get in the same way,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.800]   wrong teachings with respect to holiness and sanctification.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.320]   You will find that such teaching, again, just concentrates on how I can be delivered from
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.920]   falling into this sin, how I can be given power to overcome this temptation. It's all
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:33.880]   man-work, all directed at men. It's all designed to help me to overcome and to be victorious and so on.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:42.040]   Never put in the context of God and my relationship to him. And so, it is not the biblical teaching
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.520]   of holiness and of sanctification. There is nothing that is more vital than that we should
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:58.280]   start where the Bible starts, with the doctrine of God. Always, in everything, God and the truth
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.520]   concerning him must be the controlling factor. Well, now, there it is hurriedly, and you can
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.240]   fill it out for yourselves in detail with respect to doctrine. But come to the realm of practice.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.960]   And here again, we find that this failure, always to start with God, leads to certain
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.920]   inevitable consequences. Look at it, for instance, in the matter of evangelism.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:28.360]   Evangelism. Here's the first great activity of the Christian Church. Evangelism, preaching the
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.440]   gospel of salvation to men, calling them to repentance and of belief on the Lord Jesus
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:41.720]   Christ. How is evangelism to be conducted? And all I want to try to show you is this,
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:49.000]   that if you don't start with verse 22 of the 11th chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.240]   your evangelism will show it. And it'll show it in what? Well, in a kind of general breeziness.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:04.760]   Bonomy, jokes and laughter, bright and breezy, entertainments.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.240]   That's what happens inevitably. Because, you see, you've got the wrong idea. You're
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.600]   going to do something for people. You want to get them to do certain things,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   and you want to do certain things for them. You haven't started with God.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.400]   And so the atmosphere may, at times, resemble a musical, much more than a Christian service.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.480]   But this is designed, you see, to influence people and to get them, and so on. It affects
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.920]   evangelism of necessity. And it does do so. There's no question about this. It's all due
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:42.040]   to a failure to start with verse 22 of Romans 11. And then, you see, it does in particular,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:49.800]   it is what it is because its whole emphasis is upon man's needs. That's how it starts.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.920]   What does man need? Well, he has a man who's getting, falling constantly to a particular
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.480]   sense. Right, now then, I'm going to tell him how to be delivered from debt. That's how you start.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.720]   You start with men, you start with his needs. Need of a friend, need of happiness, need of joy,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.560]   need of physical healing, and need of guidance. Always starting with men and man's needs. And
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.440]   then, of course, you're in competition with the other agencies, and your whole attitude in
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:23.000]   evangelism is wrong. The answer to all that is this. Man's only need, ultimately, is to be
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.920]   reconciled to God. Nothing else. I think I was putting it here last Sunday night, these things
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:37.320]   are so much needed at the present time. You see, if you start with men and men's needs,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.840]   you will find there are a large number of people in this country today who are not interested in
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.280]   your evangelism. They say, "But I never do that, I've never been guilty of that." Highly moral,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.160]   intellectual people, living a good life and trying to help others. There they are, sitting in their
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.280]   self-contained homes, and they don't see any need of coming to Christ.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:02.360]   There's only one explanation. They know nothing about God.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:11.240]   There is only one way to show that everybody needs Christ, and that is to hold them face to
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:18.920]   face with God. Then the whole world lies guilty before God, and there is none righteous, no,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   not one, all of sin, and come short of the glory of God. You see how it affects, of necessity,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:32.440]   our whole approach to the unbeliever, the whole method in evangelism, and so you get wrong appeals.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:40.120]   You actually get evangelists sometimes saying, "Come, God needs you." Haven't you heard that?
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:48.040]   It's quite common, "God needs you." Or it's put in the form of the benefits of salvation.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.920]   "How foolish you are. Come, if only you came. This is what you'll get." And so the things
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.080]   are put before them, and the result is that you get people coming forward to give testimonies.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:02.760]   I've heard it, I used to hear it very frequently at one time, and it was thought to be so wonderful.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.520]   I remember a man who used to get up and he always gave this same bit of testimony.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:13.960]   He said, "I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ, he said, 25 years ago, and I've never regretted it."
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:22.520]   How patronizing, how nice of him. "I've never regretted it." As if there was even a shadow of
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:30.600]   a possibility of ever regretting it. But you see, this is all because it doesn't start where
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.360]   evangelism and everything else should start. And of course, when you get to the point of pressure
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.840]   being brought to bear upon people to take an immediate decision, it's still further wrong.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.960]   No, no, this isn't New Testament evangelism. You don't find things like that in the New Testament.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   The one thing that matters is our relationship to God, and our need to be reconciled to him.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.200]   That's why I've always said true evangelism is not interested in particular sins.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:13.080]   It doesn't matter what the sin is, everybody's a sinner. And we mustn't particularize about these
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.320]   things. It puts the emphasis in the wrong place, it creates a false interest. No, no, what we've
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:27.560]   got to realize according to the Bible is this, God and man, any man, and the need of reconciliation.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.960]   Well, there it is in evangelism. But come on this practical point to something further.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.040]   A thing that follows, as I've just been hinting, is this, that you get a false emphasis placed upon
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:47.800]   experiences of necessity. See, if you start with men and think of salvation as something that does
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.160]   something for men, well then of course, testimony is help. Because here it is, a man gets up and
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.000]   says, "I was once like that, I'm no longer like that, this is how I am now. You can be the same."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.960]   And he's only interested in being the same as you, or in having a particular experience. But you see,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.880]   that isn't the object of the preaching of the gospel, it isn't the object of the whole message
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:13.000]   of the Bible. It is to bring us to a knowledge of God. The apostle Peter puts it in a memorable
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.040]   phrase, he says that our Lord died in order to bring us to God, to this knowledge of God.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:26.680]   Don't misunderstand me, thank God for every experience, whatever form it takes.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.440]   But you know, the primary business of the gospel is not to give us experiences,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:41.800]   it is to put us right with God. And then, as I say, these false ideas of holiness tend to come in,
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:49.160]   and they come in in practice also. And we think of holiness in terms of deliverance from particular
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.000]   sins, but that's not its object. The object of holiness is to bring us into fellowship with God,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.720]   that we may enjoy this fellowship, is to prepare us for him. It must all be thought of always
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:11.480]   in terms of this fundamental relationship to God. Not some feeling you are going to get,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   or not some experience you may get, no, no. But to give you this deep knowledge,
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.160]   and to lead to a communion that goes on ever deeply, so that eventually you shall have the
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:31.720]   beatific vision, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." That's the object of
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:38.280]   holiness. Of course, it includes deliverance from sins and so on, but you don't stop at that,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.560]   because that's negative. You're always looking back. You look forward. The vision of God,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:51.320]   that's the motive for holiness. And there is to be no other. And then, in turn, you see, failure to
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.600]   start at the right place leads, as the apostle is emphasizing here in particular,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:06.120]   to all sorts and forms of pride. Pride, this devastating thing. Pride in our own activities.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.760]   Oh, of course, and how clever and subtle we are. We say, "Well, I'm not advertising, I'm saying,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.840]   I'm reporting this for the glory of God." Of course, I'm not doing it that you may know
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.320]   what a wonderful preacher I am, or what a great worker I am. No, no. I'm doing it all to the glory
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:28.920]   of God. All right. We are not ignorant of his devices. So you get men bursting of their activities,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:35.960]   bursting of their holiness even, bursting of their experiences, calling attention always to themselves.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.280]   In some shape or form, and not to God. This is how it works out in practice.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:51.720]   And let me sum it all up by putting it like this. What failure to realize the truth of this
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.400]   twenty-second verse in the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans always leads to is
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   a lack of godliness, a lack of the fear of the Lord. It leads to a lightness, a glibness,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:17.480]   a superficiality, a self-contentment, and finally, this ugly boastfulness.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:24.840]   My dear friends, am I not right when I say that this is the greatest trouble at the present time?
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.920]   We don't even use the word godliness as our fathers used to use it. How often do you hear
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.200]   about people talking about the fear of the Lord? But you see, those are the terms that are used in
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.640]   the Bible. Take, for instance, in that most lyrical book, the book of the Acts of the Apostles. I read
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:48.120]   this in chapter nine and verse thirty-one. "Then at the church's rest throughout all Judea and
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:56.840]   Galilee and Samaria and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:05.480]   Holy Ghost were multiplied." Why is this so true of us today that there isn't much evidence of the
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.600]   fear of the Lord? We all must be bright and breezy, back-slapping and happy and wonderful and
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.960]   my dear friends, it's not in the Bible, the fear of the Lord. You start with God, godliness.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:25.080]   These terms have gone out and I suggest to you that they've gone out because our thinking has
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   gone wrong. We've forgotten this verse. We've forgotten the fundamental message of the whole
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.680]   of the Bible. We are so subjective and so interested in what I can get and what I've
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:41.320]   become and what I am and so on. The approach is so subjective and man-ward that it leads
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:50.360]   inevitably to these consequences which are so evident amongst us. Alas, God have mercy upon us.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:58.120]   Now there are the manifestations of this failure to behold.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Now then, let's consider the answer to all that as given here by the apostle.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.160]   And the way he puts it, as I say, is "Behold therefore." Don't forget this therefore.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.240]   The therefore means my doctrine, what I'm going to put before you, is obviously the conclusion
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.280]   you must arrive at if you can think clearly from what I've just been saying. "Behold therefore,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:32.360]   the goodness and the severity of God." The answer to all our troubles is to know the truth about
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.320]   God and to believe it and to be subjected and subjugated to it and by it.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.600]   Well, what is this and how do we obtain it? Well, the answer is we obtain it alone
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:50.760]   through God's own revelation. You've got to start with that. You mustn't start by saying,
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.680]   "Now I cannot believe that God can..." The moment you say that, you've left the Bible,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.440]   you've left Revelation, you're thinking yourself, you're making your own God,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:05.080]   you're guilty of idolatry. And it's the only word to use about these scandalous books that are still
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.720]   being published. You are honest to gods and down to earth and all the rest of them. It's sheer
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:16.280]   idolatry. It's what they think, not what God has revealed concerning himself. That is idolatry.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.600]   Very well, we start with this revelation. But, and this is the thing that the apostle
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.400]   emphasizes here and which we must emphasize, you must not only submit yourself utterly,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:36.520]   absolutely to the revelation which God has so graciously been pleased to give of himself
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.800]   and record it in the Bible. You must not only accept that utterly and become a little child,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:50.440]   stop your own philosophic speculations, but you must take the revelation as it is.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:58.200]   What do I mean? Well, I mean that you must believe the word "and". That's all.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:04.280]   Most of our troubles arise in this realm because we forget the word "and".
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.720]   What do you mean, sir? Someone will let me tell you what I mean. "Behold, therefore,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:19.640]   the goodness of God" is the modern cry. But Paul says, "Behold, therefore, the goodness, and."
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:26.120]   And it's because the modern world and the modern church is leaving out this "and"
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:32.040]   that things are as they are. And I see no hope of restoration until we've restored this "and".
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.280]   I don't see any hope of revival until people have got hold of this "and" in this verse.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.480]   Then they'll be humble. We've got to take the revelation as it is.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.600]   If you pick and choose with revelation, you might as well be a philosopher,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.360]   because you still really are acting as a philosopher. The philosopher, as such,
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.440]   is not interested in the Bible at all. He starts with his own thoughts and works it out. You say,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.400]   "Oh, no, no, no, I believe the Bible." But do you believe the Bible? If you believe the Bible,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.800]   you believe it as it is. You believe it as a whole, and you bring in this "and". You don't
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.880]   take one aspect only. You don't say, "I believe in the goodness of God." No, no, you've got to
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:21.240]   believe also in the severity of God. Goodness and severity. Doesn't this surge us? How much do we
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:28.200]   know about the severity of God? How much time have we given to a consideration of the severity of
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.520]   God? What do the terms mean? Well, goodness means, of course, kindness and compassion.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:38.600]   What does severity mean? It meansâ€”this isn't my idea, the authorities have all agreed about this,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:46.760]   whether they're Christian or notâ€”it means severe and exact justice. That's what severity means,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:55.800]   severe and exact justice. It's exactly what the apostle has already told us in the 18th verse of
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:05.480]   the first chapter of this great epistle. "For the wrath of God has already been revealed from heaven
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:12.440]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:19.400]   That's what severity means, this wrath of God. He repeats it here. It's everywhere. It's, of course,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.560]   the message of the whole Bible. But this is the thing that men neglect. And alas, many men who
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.960]   say they believe the Bibleâ€”indeed, it seems to me this is creeping even into evangelicalism.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:35.800]   Only one side is represented, the goodness, the love of God, the mercy, the kindness,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.840]   and the compassion. And we are hearing less and less and less about the severity, the justice,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:48.200]   the righteousness, the wrath of God upon sin. That's where all our troubles come from. That's
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.880]   why the Church is as she is. So I would put this point in the third instance in this way.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:02.440]   "That we've got to realize," says the apostle here, "that God always acts as a whole."
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:11.000]   May God forgive me for using such an expression. I'm bound to use it in order to bring out this
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.920]   point. God always acts, if you prefer it unanimously. When God acts, the whole of God acts.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:27.080]   God doesn't act in parts. God acts always in the light of all his attributes, and they're all in
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:35.080]   energy and in operation at exactly the same time. All the attributes of God are always displayed
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:44.040]   togetherâ€”the goodness and the severity of God. And we must never isolate any one of the attributes
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:50.440]   of God. That's the modern heresy, that the love of God has been isolated from all the others.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:57.080]   And it's a form of idolatry, it's a form of unbelief, it's a form of philosophy and speculation.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:04.520]   We must not only not isolate any one of the attributes of God, still less must we ever
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.000]   play one of the attributes against the others. That's equally bad.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.080]   Often men have done that. They've played the righteousness of God against the mercy of God,
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.560]   and the mercy of God against the righteousness of God. They've played the goodness of God against
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.120]   the severity, and the severityâ€”you mustn't play them against one another. Not only not isolate
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:32.280]   them, don't play them against one another. God is always, and God is everything that he is.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:39.320]   God is goodness, God is severity, God is love, God is holy, God is light. All of these things
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.840]   are always true of God, and they're always true at the same time.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:56.040]   Goodness and severity, justice and mercy, righteousness and peace, holiness and love,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:03.080]   and so on. And this is, of course, the very special point that the apostle is making here,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:09.400]   and is emphasizing. He said, you know, if you begin to extract certain things, as it were,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.040]   out of the character of God, you'll soon be in trouble, you'll go astray. And it'll happen to
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.680]   you as it's happened to these Jews against whom you are now boasting. But you're traveling the
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.640]   same road. That's exactly the mistake they made. They said, "Ah, God has chosen us, and because
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.320]   God has chosen us, we're all right." They'd forgotten the justice and the righteousness
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.360]   of God. They'd forgotten what God had said to them through Moses, recorded there in the book
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.000]   of Deuteronomy, "I'm leading you into this land. Don't rest on your oars and say we're all right
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:47.720]   forever. If you don't keep on, then that's God." Very well then, then, to drive his argument right
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:56.040]   home, the apostle puts in the word "therefore." "Behold, therefore," he says, "is it possible
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:03.240]   that there is anybody who isn't clear about this, that God is all these things,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.520]   and always all these things together, and at one at the same time?"
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:16.120]   He says, "For the thing is seen so plainly." How is it seen so plainly? Well, verse 21 gives us
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:26.360]   a part of the answer. Listen. "If you think that God is only goodness, and if you think that
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   because God in his goodness has ever chosen the people, that therefore it doesn't matter what they
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.120]   do, they're always going to be saved and all right, that if you're a Christian you can play
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:41.320]   fast and loose with God and defy him and do things you know to be wrong." Listen. "If God spared not
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:48.040]   the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee." This is a great demonstration
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:55.240]   in history of the character of God. It is one of the most amazing manifestations of God's justice
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:01.160]   and righteousness and of compassion, the way in which he's handled the Jews. You see it in the
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.520]   Old Testament. They thought that they were because his people, they could do what they liked. He soon
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.920]   showed them that they couldn't. He'd raise up enemies and attack them. God would actually do
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:16.360]   that. He caused them to be carried away into captivity. It was God who did all that. He
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.040]   punishes his own people, though they are his own people, and he puts it in very strong and striking
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.920]   language at times in order to enforce this particular lesson. Listen to what he says to
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:33.240]   them through the prophet Ezekiel, for instance, writing, remember, in the captivity of Babylon.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:40.920]   In Ezekiel 14, let me read two verses to you. Verse 14, "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.280]   and Job were in it, they should deliver, but their own souls by their righteousness,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:52.040]   saith the Lord God." He repeats it in verse 20, "Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.800]   as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter. They shall but deliver
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:04.360]   their own souls by their righteousness." The Jews were always falling back on Abraham, Isaac,
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.120]   and Jacob. Noah, Daniel, Job, and so on, as if that was going to... No, no, not with a righteous
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:17.480]   and a holy God. God cannot do that sort of thing. God cannot lie. God cannot contradict his own
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:23.240]   nature. And he's given this amazing demonstration of this in the history of the world, in his
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:30.760]   handling of his own people. Though they're his own people, he punishes them. And here at this point,
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:35.240]   he's actually, as it were, cast them off temporarily, plucked them off the tree,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.800]   thrown them aside as branches that are useless and worthless.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:50.520]   But that isn't the most striking illustration in history of this principle. There is something
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.720]   that rises even above this. There, in the Old Testament, is the most amazing thing of all.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.920]   And in this dealing of God with the Jews as regards the church, you get it, as I say, repeated.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   But if you really want to see the goodness and the severity of God being manifested together,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.600]   do you know where you find it? On the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:20.680]   And there, of course, the apostle has already been putting it before us.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:27.800]   You remember the great statement in the third chapter, verses 25 and 26, "Whom God hath set
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.040]   forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood." It's God who set it forth. It's God who
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.640]   put him there to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:46.120]   the forbearance of God. To declare, I say at this time, his righteousness, listen, that he might be
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:54.600]   just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Goodness and severity. He's always got
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:05.960]   to be just, even when he's forgiving. Justice and holiness are always there, and they must always
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:13.000]   act together, and they always do act together. That is why there is only one doctrine of the
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.320]   atonement, not only in the Bible, but which is true to the biblical revelation concerning the
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:29.720]   character of God. God's love, let us never forget, is a holy love. I say to the glory of God that
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:38.040]   God cannot forgive anybody by just saying, "I'm going to forgive." He cannot. There was only one
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:46.520]   way in which God could forgive. It was by putting our sins on his Son and by punishing them in him.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:53.960]   He poured out the vials of his wrath against sin on his own Son. He hath set him forth as a
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.520]   propitiation. God's done it. That's his severity, working with his goodness, the two together.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:10.600]   It's a holy love. It is a righteous forgiveness. God must always be just, and he's never more just
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:19.560]   than when he justifies him who believes in Jesus. Oh, my dear friend, never try to separate
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.000]   the goodness and the severity of God. They're all there, and they're all there together at
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.440]   the same time. Any other view of the atonement is hopelessly defective. You cannot understand
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.600]   the sacrificial teaching of the Old Testament. You don't know what John the Baptist means when
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.720]   he says, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the whole world." You don't know why
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:45.320]   Jesus set his face catlessly to go to Jerusalem. You don't know why he said, "I have come for this
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:52.120]   hour. I'm not going to say save me from this hour. For this hour came I." You don't understand what
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.400]   he meant when he said, "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:06.360]   his life a ransom for many." You don't understand why he was ever baptized. You don't understand
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:17.000]   indeed anything in connection with him. Oh, he came into the world at all because of the goodness
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.920]   and severity of God. It is because sin must be punished that the incarnation and all that
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:32.680]   followed had to take place goodness and severity, not one without the other. Don't separate them.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.160]   Don't even put your emphasis on the severity alone without the goodness. Otherwise, you're
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.720]   putting yourself in hell, my friend, in your reaction against the glibness and the lightness
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.840]   of today. Beware lest you go to the opposite extreme and say that God is only severe. Don't
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.960]   forget his goodness. Don't forget his grace and mercy. They're all there together at the same
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:45:00.920]   time. Believe the revelation as it is. Very well. Shall I try and bring this aspect of the teaching
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:08.520]   to a conclusion tonight by putting it like this? The object of salvation,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:15.960]   always, is to bring us to God and to a knowledge of him.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:25.560]   The ultimate object of salvation is the glory of God, not primarily anything in men.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:35.400]   The way of salvation is God's way of salvation, not men's. Whether men understand it or not,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.240]   it is God's, and that's what it is.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:45.080]   The object of salvation is not just to give us forgiveness,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:50.600]   but to make us holy, to make us righteous.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:00.280]   "Who gave himself for us," says Paul to Titus in Titus 2.14, "that he might separate unto himself
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:07.400]   a peculiar people, zealous of good works." That's the object of forgiveness, not an end in itself.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:19.160]   And therefore, in the light of this, we must never presume on the love of God or on the
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:26.120]   forgiveness that we have received. If you presume on the fact that you are a Christian and a child
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:37.320]   of God, I tremble for you and what may happen to you. Complacency or self-satisfaction in the
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:44.120]   Christian life should be impossible. And it is impossible if you realize this.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.000]   Whatever a man may have had by way of forgiveness, whatever experiences he may have had,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.640]   whatever God may have enabled him to do, when he puts himself in the sight of God,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:01.880]   who is he, what is he? Complacency, self-satisfaction, stillness, pride, it's unthinkable.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:11.960]   This is the great antidote to such tendencies. Carelessness, thoughtlessness, glibness,
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:27.240]   and lightness are impossible in the light of this reminder of the goodness and severity of God.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:34.920]   "On them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness;
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:47.640]   otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:57.160]   That's it. "It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Work it out
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.840]   with fear and trembling." Don't think of salvation in terms of yourself and your subjective states
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.880]   and conditions or your benefits. Think of it in terms of your relationship to him,
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:18.760]   and remember his goodness and severity. "Never presume, but walk circumspectly, walk carefully,
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:27.080]   walk with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.600]   Very well. As we are tempted of the devil along these lines,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:38.760]   the word of the apostle to us all is this, "Behold therefore, behold therefore,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:50.600]   the goodness and the severity of God." O Lord, our God, we come to thee again,
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:49:01.640]   and we come, O Lord, to acknowledge our folly and our ignorance and our failure above all to believe
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:08.680]   thy word. Thou hast revealed it so plainly and clearly to us. Thou hast set before us
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:17.160]   this example of thine own people, the children of Israel. Yet, O Lord, we are ever prone and
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:23.560]   ready to fall into the self-same error and trap of the devil. God, have mercy upon us.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:33.000]   We thank thee that with thee there is mercy that thou mayest be feared. Keep us ever, we pray thee,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:43.080]   in the knowledge of these things, and give us all a heartfelt desire to live only to thy glory and
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:50.200]   praise and honour. Whatever may happen to us, whatever men may do with us, whatever the world,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:57.800]   the flesh, the devil, and hell should do with us, give us, O Lord, a single eye to thy glory
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:06.920]   and to thy praise. Let nothing please nor pain us apart, O Lord, from thee.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:20.280]   communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout the remainder
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:32.600]   of this short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see God. Amen.
