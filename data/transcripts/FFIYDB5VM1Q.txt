[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   On Monday we looked at the topic of making shipwreck of the faith.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   What does it look like to make shipwreck of the faith?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   What are some personal examples of those whose faith failed?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Why does it happen?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And how do people shipwreck their faith today?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's a common question.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And we addressed it on Monday in APJ 1849.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   But we didn't focus very much on the fallout.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Spiritual failure at this level among those who love the world and thus abandon Christ for it,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   that injects tremendous pain into families, into marriages, into friendships,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   into local church communities, and into the ministries of people who are left behind.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   That pain, that relational pain of ministry, was a theme taken up by Pastor John in a sermon in 2012
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   as he reflected on the harsh realities Paul faced.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   According to what he recounts for us in 2 Timothy 4 verses 9 to 18.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Christian ministry is relationally hard.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm thinking first about Paul and Timothy and vocational ministers.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   But I'm thinking of you too because you are all, if you're Christian, you're all ministers
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   called upon to love other people for their good according to your gifts.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   That's what ministry is and that's every believer.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So I think this is for you when I say Christian ministry, that is Christian life, is relationally hard.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And Paul seems to want Timothy to feel that because of how many he dumps on him.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Here's five and there are more.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Verse 10, "Demus, in love with the present world, has deserted me."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He's gone to Thessalonica.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think Demus was once a faithful partner because over in Colossians chapter 4,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   he says, "Luke, the beloved physician, greets you and so does Demus."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now he's gone and he's forsaken Paul.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   That's number one.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Number two, just being alone in the ministry, not just forsaken, but alone in the ministry can be a trial.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So verses 10, middle of the verse, "Crescens has gone to Galatia."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I don't think that means he forsook me.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I just think there's some ministry things that I want him to do.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   "Crescens has gone to Galatia. Titus over to Dalmatia. Luke alone is with me."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So once upon a time, there was quite a team here.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And now it's just me and Luke and it gets worse.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Number three, "Alexander the coppersmith," this is verse 14,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   "Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Verse 15, middle of the verse, "He strongly opposed our message."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So ministry is relationally hard, not just because there's loneliness and sometimes abandonment on the inside,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   but there's opposition, verbal, on the outside.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And nobody likes to be verbally attacked.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's hard to be verbally assaulted, even by people you expect it from.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every moment of unexpected silence from a friend and every verbal blow from an enemy wounds the spirit of the Christian.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And it happens a lot.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So ministry is relationally hard.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Number four, verse 16, perhaps the saddest sentence in the paragraph or the book,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   "At my first defense, no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm going to come back to this, but for now, just feel the force of it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Luke, where were you?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Number five, verses 20 to 21, "Erastus remained at Corinth.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I left Trophimus, who was ill, at Miletus.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Do your best to come before winter."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So sometimes strategic deployments take away friends.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I left Trophimus.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Sometimes sickness interrupts a planned partnership.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I left him sick.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Sometimes seasonal changes make aloneness all the more difficult.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Please try to get here before winter.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Paul mentions those things surely to cause Timothy to feel ministry is hard relationally.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Friends in the ministry can let you down and never return or care for you again.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Verse 10, "Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now I admit I do not know if he repented."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   There's nothing in the Bible that says he did or didn't.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   There's no evidence that he did, but surely all of us, at least those who are older,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   know ministers who have forsaken their partners and left the ministry, left the faith,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and as far as we know, never returned.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We know people like that.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I think Paul wants Timothy here to feel not only a preparation for this sorrow in ministry.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   This happens, Timothy.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm telling you it happened to me so that you'll be ready when it happens to you.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I think he also wants to hear the cause so that he can avoid that and doesn't ever do it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   In other words, not ever is abandoned and doesn't ever abandon because he's seen the cause here.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   "Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   There is a love for the world that makes ministry impossible.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   There is a love for the world that produces either the abandonment of ministry or the making of ministry so worldly it's useless.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   That happens as often.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So if a minister starts to become worldly, he's got two choices.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Leave the ministry or make the ministry worldly.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Then he can survive.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Demas couldn't.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Why?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Because of Paul.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It wasn't going to happen on Paul's team.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   So here's a caution to young and I say old, but I think especially young, culture-embracing evangelical Christians.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   You need to ponder Demas a long time.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   "In love with this present world," he found ministry with Paul impossible.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And he left it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   There is a love for the world.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   There is a love for this present age, this God-ignoring, God-denying, God-demeaning, Christ-distorting products of culture that is mutually exclusive with real deep love for Jesus.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   There is a love for this world that is irreconcilable with ministry to the world.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The ministry of exposing the world, the ministry of witnessing to the world, the ministry of rescuing people from the world.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   None of that's going to happen very well if you just love it so much.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And they think you're just one of them.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So, young Timothy and young Bethlehem, remember, more people leave Christ and more people leave church and more people leave ministry out of love for the world than anything else.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I've wondered, what was in Thessalonica?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   "In love with this world," this present world, "Demas has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Was it a woman?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Was it home?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Maybe he grew up there and he was just nostalgic and was tired of this missionary life and living with the Apostle Paul and just wanted to go home.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Was it a business offer?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   "I got gifts for goodness sakes.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I can make some money."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Or was it just a comfortably safe distance away from this maniac Paul?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We don't know.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.660]   Here's what we know, Demas didn't leave out of love for Jesus, but out of love for the
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.160]   world.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.040]   That's why everybody leaves.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.940]   He didn't leave to follow Jesus.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.320]   He left Jesus to embrace the world, the pleasures of the world, the entertainments of the world,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   the kickback of the world, the praise of the world, the friends of the world.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.280]   So some of your partners in ministry will do that.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.960]   Very very sobering to ponder Demas' life decisions and the pain that he caused in Paul's life
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.300]   as well.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.840]   This clip was taken from John Piper's sermon, "He Stood by Me and Strengthened Me for the
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.880]   Sake of the Gospel," preached on August 26, 2012.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.960]   The entire message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.840]   So speaking of the ministry, how much speculation should we bring into the pulpit in our sermons?
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   In every text we're going to face unanswered questions.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.080]   So what do we do with the uncertainties in our Bible text?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.920]   Do we embellish?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.240]   Do we guess?
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.880]   Do we speculate?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.340]   Or do we just tell people what we don't know?
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.600]   It's a great and practical question about a common dilemma all preachers and teachers
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   face.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.960]   That's up on Friday.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.440]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
