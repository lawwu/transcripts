[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.720]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.800]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.400]   My guest today is Dr. Brian Keating.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.960]   Dr. Brian Keating is a professor of cosmology
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.320]   at the University of California, San Diego.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.460]   Today's discussion is perhaps the most zoomed out discussion
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.560]   that we've ever had on this podcast.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.040]   What I mean by that is today we talk about
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   the origins of the universe.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.040]   We talk about the Earth's relationship to the sun
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.640]   and to the other planets.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.880]   We talk a lot about optics,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   so not just the neuroscience of vision
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.520]   and our ability to see things up close and far away,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   but to see things very, very far away
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   or very, very close up
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.880]   using telescopes or microscopes respectively.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.680]   So today's discussion is a far-reaching one,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.720]   literally and figuratively,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.800]   and one that I know everyone will appreciate
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480]   because it really will teach you
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.760]   how the scientific process is carried out.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.040]   It will also help you understand
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.780]   that science is indeed a human endeavor
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.960]   and that much of what we understand about ourselves
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.240]   and about the world around us,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120]   and indeed the entire universe,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   is filtered through that humanness.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.080]   But I want to be very clear
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.320]   that today's discussion is not abstract.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.720]   You're going to learn a lot of concrete facts
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.980]   about the universe, about humanity,
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.320]   and about the process of discovery.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.440]   In fact, much of what we talk about today
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.240]   is about the process of humans discovering things
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.020]   about themselves and about the world.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200]   Dr. Keating has an incredible perspective
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.820]   and approach to science,
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.980]   having built, for instance,
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.360]   giant telescopes down at the South Pole
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.080]   and having taken on many other truly ambitious builds
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.000]   in service to this thing we call discovery.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.920]   Before we begin,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.720]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.360]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.200]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.520]   to the general public.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760]   this podcast episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.080]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Brian Keating.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.820]   Dr. Brian Keating, welcome.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.040]   - Dr. Andrew Huberman,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.560]   it's great to meet you in person finally.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.280]   I thought you were a legend.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.960]   - I exist in real life and you do as well,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.280]   and I'm delighted that we're going to talk today
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.900]   because I have a longstanding adoration,
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.440]   there's no other appropriate word,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.800]   for eyes, vision, optics,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   the stars, the moon, the sun.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   I mean, animals, humans,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.780]   what's more interesting than how we got here
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.520]   and how we see things and what we see and why?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.360]   - That's right.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.880]   - You're a physicist, you're a cosmologist,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.320]   not a cosmetologist.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.840]   - That's right, I do do hair and makeup
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.680]   if you're interested.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.880]   (laughing)
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   - Please orient us in the galaxy.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.040]   - So I get to study the entire universe basically,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.760]   and it's not really such a stretch
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.000]   that cosmetology and cosmology share this prefix
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.160]   because the prefix cosmos
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.440]   is what relates those two words together
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   that seem to be completely, you know,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   unrelated to each other, right?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.200]   But it turns out the word cosmos in Greek,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.800]   the etymology of it, is beautiful or appearance.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.840]   So we have a beautiful appearance,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.760]   you know, we look a certain way,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.580]   we're attracted to certain things,
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.880]   but it kind of reflects the fact that the night sky
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.200]   is also beautiful, attractive,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.380]   and evokes something viscerally in us.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760]   We humans are born with two refracting telescopes
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.240]   in our skulls, embedded in our skulls,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.480]   and as you point out, you know,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.760]   the retinas outside the cranial vault, right?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'll never forget you saying that.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   That means we have astronomical detection tools
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.240]   built into us.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.000]   We don't have tools to detect the Higgs boson
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.280]   built into us or to look at a microscopic virus
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.540]   or something like that.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.480]   So astronomy is not only the oldest of all sciences,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.000]   it's the most visceral one, so connects us.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.520]   And of the sciences, of that branch of science,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.600]   of astronomical sciences,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   cosmology is really the most overarching.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.680]   It really includes everything,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.760]   all physical processes that were involved
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   in the formation of matter, of energy,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   maybe of time itself.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   And it speaks to a universal urge, I think,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.480]   to know what came before us.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.680]   Like I always ask people, I'll ask you,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.440]   I know what the answer is, probably,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.180]   but what's your favorite day on the calendar?
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.020]   - Favorite day on the calendar?
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.740]   - Yeah.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.020]   - I love New Year's Day.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.300]   - New Year's Day, exactly.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.140]   What is that?
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.960]   It's a beginning.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.180]   It's a new, some people say their birthday,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.980]   their kid's birthday, if they're smart,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.940]   their anniversary, right?
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.060]   You know, you don't wanna get too out of control
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.300]   with the misses.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.120]   What are those?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.960]   Those are beginnings.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.160]   What's the only event that no entity
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.780]   could even bear witness to?
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.660]   The origin of the universe.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.980]   I think that speaks to something primal in human beings
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.420]   that are curious, at least.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.980]   We wanna uncover the secrets of what existed,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.320]   what came before us.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.940]   And we don't have any way of seeing that currently.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.140]   So we have to use the fossils that have made their way
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.180]   throughout all of cosmic time
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.140]   to understand what that was like
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.820]   at the very beginning of time.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.420]   And perhaps, maybe, about the universe as it existed
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.380]   before time itself began.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.660]   So to me, it's incredibly fascinating.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.740]   It encompasses all of science in some sense.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.780]   It even can include life on other planets,
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.060]   consciousness, the formation of the brain.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.060]   And to me, I'm always interested in the biggest questions.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.200]   And the biggest topics that evoke curiosity in me
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.460]   is how did it all get here?
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.580]   And so that's what cosmology allows us to do,
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.940]   apply the strict exacting laws of physics
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.900]   to a specific domain,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.020]   which is the origin of everything in the universe.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.140]   That's what makes it so fascinating.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.380]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.020]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.980]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.900]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.300]   all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.620]   Proper hydration is critical
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.740]   for optimal brain and body function.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.400]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.040]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.300]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.000]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.540]   are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body,
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.800]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.200]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.660]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.500]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.100]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.700]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.380]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.880]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.900]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.420]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.140]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.780]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.900]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.760]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   They have a bunch of different
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.460]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.540]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.780]   Frankly, I love them all.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.080]   And now that we're in the winter months
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.500]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.480]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.820]   I really like the chocolate flavors,
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.740]   especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.180]   so you put it in hot water,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.940]   and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.260]   especially when it's cold and dry outside,
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260]   when hydration is especially critical.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.600]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.700]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.260]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.100]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.620]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.120]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.540]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.940]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.300]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.740]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.780]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.100]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.340]   There are essentially three things
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.020]   that great therapy provides.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.860]   First of all, it provides a good rapport
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.700]   with somebody that you can trust and talk to
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.700]   about all issues that you're concerned about.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.900]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.020]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.680]   And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.220]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.980]   to find an expert therapist with whom you resonate with
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.380]   and can provide those benefits
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.460]   that come through effective therapy.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.220]   Also, because BetterHelp allows therapy
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.260]   to be done entirely online, it's very time-efficient.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.300]   It's easy to fit into a busy schedule.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.060]   There's no commuting to a therapist's office
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.960]   or sitting in a waiting room or anything like that.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.340]   You simply go online and hold your appointment.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.060]   If you would like to try BetterHelp,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.560]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman

[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.760]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.100]   - Before we get to the origins of the universe
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.860]   and the organization of the planets relative to the sun
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.500]   and their spins, et cetera, you said something
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.560]   that at least to me feels intuitively so true,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.340]   and I think it's very likely to be true for everybody,
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.460]   which is that there's something about looking up into space,
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.680]   especially at night when we see the stars
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.620]   and hopefully see the stars.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.060]   We'll talk about light pollution a little bit later.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.460]   When we see the stars that,
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.640]   yes, we know these things are far away.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.340]   Yes, we know that they occupy a certain position in space.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.180]   They have a diameter, et cetera.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.980]   We might not know what that is just by looking at them.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.980]   You probably do, but they also change our perception of time.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.940]   And if I were to say one thing
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.560]   about the human brain especially is that,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.320]   sure, it's got all these autonomic functions.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.440]   It regulates heart rate, digestion, et cetera,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.160]   sleep-wake cycles.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.980]   It can remember, it can think.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.980]   It can have states like rage or anger
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.360]   or happiness or delight.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.740]   But what's remarkable about the human brain
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.180]   is that it can think into the past.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.700]   It can be "present" and it can project into the future.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.460]   And I'm sure other animals can do that,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.980]   but we do this exquisitely well,
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.980]   and we make plans on the basis of this ability
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.460]   to contract or expand our notion of time.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.300]   As a non-biologist, but somebody who I think appreciates
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.780]   and understands biology,
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.300]   why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky,
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.860]   even though most people might not realize
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.140]   that those stars probably aren't there
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.960]   and occupying the position that we think they are,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.860]   some of them probably are, some of them aren't,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.620]   they existed a long time ago, but without knowing that,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.460]   why do you think that looking up at the stars
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.940]   gives us the sense of an expansion of time
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.900]   as opposed to just the expansion of space?
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.980]   - Well, first of all, we have to take ourselves back
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.260]   to deep prehistory.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.260]   We know that ancients were looking at the constellations
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.940]   because they were seemingly either in control of
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.420]   or correlated with or perhaps causative of the seasons.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.820]   And that was of divine importance,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.620]   supreme importance for them, right?
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.300]   Their whole existence in early agrarian societies,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.740]   hunting societies, gathering societies.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.980]   So they had to know about time.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.260]   So time, the essence of time, and that on large scale,
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.580]   for seasons, for holidays, for festivals,
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.500]   for propitiation of deities and so forth,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.900]   they had to keep track of it.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.500]   And that's why in the caves in Lascaux
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.300]   that date back to the 40,000 BCE,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.900]   they depict constellations, Orion, the hunter,
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.140]   Taurus, the bull, all these different constellations,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.260]   they depict them there.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.780]   Now, partially that was because Netflix
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.780]   didn't exist back then, right?
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.860]   There was no TikTok.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.920]   And so there wasn't much to do at night.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.660]   And in fact, the more you were out at night,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.540]   you probably increased your opportunity
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.580]   to be consumed by some predator, right?
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.540]   So you were more focused on being stationary, observing.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.460]   And as I said, we can do astronomy,
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.240]   uniquely so amongst all the sciences,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.060]   with just the equipment we're born with.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.900]   You know, measurements with our eyes,
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.840]   with respect to landmarks, to calculate patterns.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.780]   And humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns,
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.700]   sometimes too good.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.220]   - So for instance, knowing that a certain swath of stars
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.500]   is present at one time of year and not another
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.180]   relative to say the contour of a mountain ridge.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.580]   - Yes, and the repetition of it over,
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.340]   and it passed down through generations.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.860]   Before there was written language, there was pictography.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.740]   There was the cave paintings and so forth.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.340]   There was oral language and that was it.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.120]   For written language is only 10,000 years old
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.220]   or something like that.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.300]   So to store information, that meant it was a continuity
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.340]   between generations.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.140]   My great-great-great-great-grandfather's elders,
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.820]   whatever, taught me that when the moon
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.780]   is in this constellation, the sun is in this constellation,
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.580]   we all should plant or we should harvest
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.220]   in other times.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.460]   And so it was, and we still do use the, you know,
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.500]   the rotation of the earth hasn't changed that much
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.460]   since this 40,000 year period, right?
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.180]   I mean, the axis in which it rotates,
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.600]   that's a different story, but the actual spin rate,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.060]   the angular momentum of the earth
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.180]   has not depreciably changed that much.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.860]   And so the positions of these objects
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.460]   were of such importance that the ancients would use them
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.200]   for all these purposes, but there were so few things
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.440]   that changed position that they actually had names for them.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.700]   They're called planets.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.540]   So planet in Greek, it's like the word plane,
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.220]   like airplane, it means something that moves or wanders.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.740]   So when you name something, it means it's pretty different
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.860]   from the other things in which are not associated
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.180]   with that characteristic.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.180]   So the planets, there were only five that they could,
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.620]   you know, see at that time up to Saturn.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.820]   And they actually would associate those,
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.140]   not only with astronomical events,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.140]   but events down on earth.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.480]   That's what connected the earth.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.980]   And so we have legacy of that in our calendar today.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.900]   So Sunday, named after the sun.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.080]   Monday, moon.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.860]   Tuesday, and you go to the Latin languages.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.300]   I think it's Mercury Day, which is Mercury Day.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.620]   Vantra Day, Venus Day, so you go to the Romance languages.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.420]   And then the only one that's not a Latin name
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.320]   is, of course, for Thor, the god Thor, Thursday.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.780]   And then it comes back Saturn Day, Saturday.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.360]   So they were all used as a clock.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.380]   And people don't really grasp this.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.980]   I mean, we have an Apple Watch, we have whatever.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.020]   We didn't have a clock that was functional,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.020]   that would work on all different time zones
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.620]   and all different conditions on the pitching deck of a ship
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.740]   till the 1700s, basically.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.500]   It was a huge problem.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.300]   And so measuring time became crucial for commerce,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.420]   for human culture and civilization to arise,
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.600]   for education, and obviously for planting, harvesting,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.100]   and so forth.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.860]   So there was an obvious connection between the two.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.300]   They believed, actually, that they were causative.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.820]   That, actually, the position of the planet Jupiter
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.900]   determined something on the day of your birth,
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.380]   and the sun's relative position with respect to it
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.260]   determined something about your future and your prospects
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.420]   in life, and so forth.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.820]   So when I'm not confused for a cosmetologist,
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.020]   because of my lovely hair and makeup,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.740]   I'm usually asked, oh, you're an astronomer.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.740]   I'm a Virgo.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.700]   So what's going to happen to me?
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.780]   I'm like, I used to be, oh, OK, that's an astrologer.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.740]   I'm not an astrologer.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.260]   But now I kind of lean into it.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.060]   I'm like, ooh, you're going to get a letter from the IRS
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.560]   next week.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.060]   And that lump on your ass, that's--
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.980]   You mean you're playing games with them.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.540]   So you don't believe in astrology.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.940]   There's no evidence for astrology.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.740]   In fact, there's many, many random controlled trials,
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.300]   double-bund study, that showed not only is it--
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.980]   it's almost counter to the evidence.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.300]   They say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.740]   and do better than most hedge fund managers,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.700]   or something like that.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.900]   Actually, astrologers are even worse.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.140]   I don't even know a protozoa could throw a dart.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.020]   It's almost anti-correlated with what reality is.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.220]   So no, there's certainly no validity to that.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.300]   And I had a provocative tweet, whatever, post recently.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.540]   And it was about--
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.400]   there's actually-- we believe there are 12 zodiac signs.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.860]   And that dates back to the Persians and the Babylonians,
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.060]   and how they divided up them.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.100]   And it almost divides--
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   they were fascinated with the number 60.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.260]   So that was the base of their number system.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.980]   Our number system is 10, because we have 10 figures.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.440]   For some reason, they love base 60.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.140]   I don't know why.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.500]   And so they love things that divide evenly into it.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.300]   10 does, but anyway, hashtag fail for the Babylonians.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.060]   But they divided it up into 12 zodiac signs.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.220]   So we still use those.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.700]   There is a problem, though.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.420]   The zodiac that you're-- do you know what this is?
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.460]   Do you know what determines your zodiac sign?
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:09.960]   No.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.460]   Oh, OK.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.260]   So it's determined by the position of the sun.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.100]   What constellation was the sun in on the day you were born?
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.260]   September 26.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.260]   So that means that the sun was in the constellation Virgo.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.780]   Oh, no.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.600]   You were a Libra?
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.100]   Libra.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.620]   Libra, OK.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.020]   You do know what you are, but you don't know why you are.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.940]   So Libra means it's a constellation.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.460]   There's 88 constellations that are accepted by astronomers.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.620]   And one of them is Libra.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.360]   And the path that the sun and the moon and all the planets
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.020]   travel in is called the zodiac.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.020]   It's confined to a plane because the same proto-solar system
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.860]   disk from which we formed out of-- all the planets came out
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.980]   of a nebular cloud, a cloud of gas, dust, rocks, and so forth
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.220]   that came from a pre-existing star that exploded,
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.060]   creating what's called a supernova.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060]   The supernova provided the materials
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.420]   to make not only the Earth, but the entire solar system,
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.580]   including the sun.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.780]   That happened about 5 billion years ago.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.760]   And 4 billion years ago, the Earth
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.720]   formed out of that cloud.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.220]   The spin of that disk, all things
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.460]   have a spin associated with them, like a figure skater.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.380]   She's spinning around on her axis or whatever.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.340]   She can have her arms out, brings them in.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.220]   She spins faster.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.260]   That's called conservation of angular momentum.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.140]   Spin is a type of angular momentum.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.880]   The whole disk is spinning in a plane.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.300]   It's like this desk, this table that we're sitting at.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.700]   If you're listening, you imagine a flat table.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.340]   It's spinning.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.260]   A circular disk is spinning with a certain direction.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.740]   All the objects are moving in that same direction
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.060]   due to conservation of this term called angular momentum.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.540]   The sun moves in that-- apparently
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.500]   moves in that position.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.200]   Obviously, we're rotating around the sun,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.180]   but it looks like the sun's coming around us.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.820]   The moon is, Jupiter-- so on the day you were born,
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.180]   there's a constellation behind the sun from our perspective
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.860]   that was Libra on September 26.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.660]   And that was the day that you were born.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.500]   That determines the fact that you're a Libra.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.920]   But there's a problem.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.380]   In December, where we are now, the sun
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.060]   is actually in a different constellation.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.560]   The one that doesn't exist according
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.860]   to the zodiac that was created something like 5,000 years ago.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.100]   It's called Ophiuchus.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.300]   So there's a certain segment of people
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.740]   born in a 17-day stretch in late November to early December
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.900]   that are actually Ophiuchans or Ophiuchuses or whatever.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.700]   So that should obliterate astrology
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.460]   as any semblance of a science, because they didn't even
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.020]   know this constellation existed.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.880]   And yet, something like 12% of all people
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.420]   share that constellation.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.020]   So it's just complete nonsense.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.180]   There's no validity to it.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.900]   Twins that are born on the same day
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.980]   have radically different histories, past, futures.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.140]   And there's no predictive power to it.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.820]   And that's what science is about, right?
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.140]   We want to make a hypothesis, test it, iterate on it,
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.380]   and have confirmation of it.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.620]   And there's zero, in fact, for astrology.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.780]   In fact, if you'll permit me a kind of silly story,
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.900]   when I was dating my wife, who would become my wife
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.660]   in the beginning, she kind of thought it's fun.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.940]   Maybe we'll go see someone who can tell our fortunes,
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.940]   if we belong together.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.780]   So we went to an astrologer.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.340]   And the astrologer asked me a bunch of questions.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.860]   When were you born, obviously?
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.260]   And oh, no, she asked me, what's your sign?
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.820]   So I said, I'm a Gemini.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   And she said, OK, cool.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.380]   And then she told me a bunch of things.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.580]   And at the end, I said, I just want to double check.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.460]   I was playing kind of a little bit of a jerk sometimes.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.420]   So I said, I just want to confirm.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.060]   Gemini is born in September.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.740]   I'm born September 9th.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.700]   She said, oh, no, no, that's a Virgo.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.980]   But the same things are going to happen to you anyway.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.700]   It didn't change her outcome.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.660]   And so in the language of the philosophy of science,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.140]   Karl Popper, others, it's unfalsifiable.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.420]   And you cannot be proven right.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.820]   It's so flexible.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.460]   You're going to find challenges.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.700]   The stock market is going to fluctuate.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.780]   Political turmoil will reign during your--
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.540]   they're so flexible, it can accommodate any story.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.340]   And that's a hallmark of non-science, or sometimes
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.200]   anti-scientific thinking.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.500]   One thing that really strikes me is the fact
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.100]   that, at least just the way you describe it, the first clock,
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.820]   the first timekeeping approach or mechanism
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.100]   was to evaluate the position of things in the sky
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.780]   relative to celestial landmarks.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.620]   So irrespective of when people are born in astrology,
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.700]   I could imagine a tribe of people, a group of people,
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.560]   who have charts because they've painted them
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.400]   onto some surface-- doesn't matter what the surface is--
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.900]   that, at some portion of the year,
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.360]   the stars are above this ridge.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.180]   There are three bright stars above the ridge
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.440]   just to the left of the front of the village, so to speak.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.160]   This is not an unreasonable thing to imagine.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.740]   And that information is passed down
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.080]   in the form of when those three stars are
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.440]   about to disappear behind that ridge,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.600]   days are getting shorter.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.120]   Whereas when those three stars are re-emerging again
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.040]   elsewhere in the sky, days are getting longer.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.240]   Forgive me, this will be a little bit of a long question.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.800]   Sometimes the listeners get upset with me,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.680]   but I think it'll frame it within the biology
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.800]   in a way that will be meaningful for us and for everyone.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.520]   Other animals besides humans have this thing,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.680]   a pineal gland that secretes melatonin.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   The duration of melatonin release
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.960]   is directly related to how much light there is.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.840]   In other words, light suppresses melatonin.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.200]   Therefore, in short days, aka long nights,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   you get a lot more melatonin released.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.400]   In long days and short nights, you get less melatonin.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.640]   So this is the intrinsic clock-keeping mechanism
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.760]   of all mammalian species and reptiles.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.820]   Most people don't realize this,
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.840]   but reptiles often have either a thin skull,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.040]   birds have a very thin skull,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.320]   so that light can actually pass through the skull
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.260]   to the pineal.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.760]   Some reptiles actually have pits in the top of their heads
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.680]   that light can pass directly in to the pineal.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.720]   These are animals that, mind you,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.420]   also have eyes for perceiving things,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.800]   but this is the primordial,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.640]   biologically primordial timekeeping device.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.960]   And you imagine why this would be really important,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.200]   and then I'll get back to why I think that
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.180]   because humans have a pineal
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.060]   that's embedded deep in the brain,
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.200]   light cannot, despite what some people think out there,
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.060]   I'm not gonna name names,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.940]   but light cannot get through the skull to the pineal,
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.620]   nor is putting a light in your ear is gonna get there,
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.140]   or even in the roof of your mouth, very unlikely,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.100]   maybe some distant stimulation
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.580]   of the neurons in your hypothalamus with long wavelength.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.780]   But in any case,
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.300]   the pineal of humans is embedded deep in the skull,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.040]   and so that information about
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.400]   how much light is in the environment
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.580]   has to be passed through the eyes,
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.640]   through a circuitous circuit to the,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.100]   through a circuitous path to the pineal.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.240]   But here's the thing, here's the conundrum.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.380]   An animal or human born into an eight-hour day
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.680]   when days are getting longer
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.240]   has a very different future as an infant,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.000]   as an infant or baby that's born into an eight-hour day
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.640]   when days are getting shorter,
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.940]   especially if you live closer to the poles,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.100]   further from the equator.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.240]   So think about this, you're a pregnant woman,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.060]   or you're the husband of that pregnant woman,
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.340]   and you have a baby coming,
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.700]   and you need to know that days are getting longer or shorter
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.700]   and what that means for resources,
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.460]   because the probability of the survival of that child,
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.660]   and even the mother during and immediately after childbirth
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.280]   was strongly dictated by what resources were available,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.420]   the strength of the immune system, et cetera.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.740]   Animals solve this by light going directly into the pineal.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.640]   I'm not one of those animals,
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.000]   so I don't know if they're conscious of this.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.520]   Humans needed to solve this some other way.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.840]   They needed to know whether or not
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.120]   days were getting longer or shorter.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.680]   And so the question I have is,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.000]   is the movement of the stars or planets
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.280]   detectable enough with these telescopes
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.000]   that we have in the front of our skull?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.560]   Is it perceivable enough that one could know
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.680]   whether or not days were getting longer or shorter
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.560]   simply by looking up at the sky at night,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.640]   or are the shifts imperceptible,
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.200]   and therefore you would need to create these charts?
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.040]   And now I think it's kind of obvious
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.160]   while I'm asking this question,
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.040]   because to me, this is the reason to chart time.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.840]   And this is the reason it occurs to me
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.340]   why looking up at the sky at night
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.040]   is meaningful for tracking time.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.560]   And not only correlated with that,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.160]   something even more perhaps basic is temperature, right?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.200]   In the hemisphere that you're born in,
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   you would expect that all,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.680]   I'm born, as I said, September 9th.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.440]   Turns out that's the statistically most common birth date
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.740]   of humans on Earth.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   And why is that?
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.320]   - People are busy during the winter holiday.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.160]   - Exactly, right?
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.440]   So there's a correlation, right?
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.400]   - Yeah, they're at home and they're indoors.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.320]   - They're at home.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.440]   - And they're procreating.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.000]   - And they're, right.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.240]   Or another thing is what month you're born in,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.220]   well, you go back nine months.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.640]   So actually, capitalism's awesome, right?
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.000]   So it's so efficient.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.160]   So when you go to CVS,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.520]   and I've known this several times, thank God,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.720]   'cause my wife's been pregnant several times,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.280]   and we have several kids.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.440]   And when you go to CVS, it's actually pretty interesting,
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.080]   she goes there to buy a pregnancy test.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.020]   Now, she's the kind of neurotic person that,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.520]   she had to buy like five pregnancy tests for each kid.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.040]   Okay, I don't know why, but that's what she did.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.860]   So she's a--
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.700]   - She likes data.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.540]   - She's got the gold card.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.680]   - How do you, okay, everybody, statistics.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.820]   How do you reduce variability?
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.960]   Increase sample size.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.040]   Yes, unless it's a systematic error.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.240]   And that's what I wanna talk to you about later
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.720]   when it comes to the eye and other things.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   You go to CVS, you buy a pregnancy test,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   and she's on their gold plan program,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.320]   whatever, she got the gold card from CVS
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.200]   because she's on it so many times.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   But when you go there,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.080]   they know you're getting a pregnancy test.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   So exactly nine months later,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.720]   we start getting advertisements for Pampers,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.840]   and for diapers, and for diaper creams,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.680]   and wives and stuff.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.500]   So they know this, they don't know.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.660]   - They're hedging even without knowing
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.640]   the results of the test. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.760]   What's the downside for them?
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.000]   - Well, she buys five tests.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.200]   They're probably assuming something very different
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.400]   than if she bought one test.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.360]   - Anyway, so the temperature, right?
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.720]   So if you're gestating during summertime versus wintertime,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   that obviously will have some kind of an effect.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.400]   I mean, you can tell me a lot more than that,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.360]   but more than that, you hinted at this,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.280]   and I'm not gonna make you do any math surrounding pregnancy,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.660]   but God forbid.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.600]   (both laughing)
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.440]   - Hey, man. - I sympathize with you.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.260]   - I put out the correction to that.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.100]   - I defended you, I defended you.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.760]   - I was talking fast.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.680]   The irony of that one, I'll just say for the record,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.040]   I'm just blushing, the irony of that one
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.560]   is that we've published numerous times
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.760]   from my lab cumulative probability,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.000]   and I teach this stuff.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So it's oftentimes when you're going fast,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.480]   but that one I totally deserved.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.000]   - I love it, I love it.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.240]   - Whatever shades of red I might turn.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.280]   - That's what a good scientist does.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.120]   - Oh, man.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.680]   - But they actually think
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.760]   that the first astronomers were women.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.480]   Think about it, because they noticed this correlation.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.440]   What's their monthly cycle?
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.520]   Their menstrual cycle is exactly 29 1/2 days,
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.360]   which is actually the lunar cycle
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.580]   down to almost a minute.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.600]   It's insane, right, that they would have looked up
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.820]   and noticed this renewal and diminishing of the moon,
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.160]   and that there's actually evidence.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.320]   Now, they weren't professional astronomers until,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.200]   actually, the first professional female astronomer
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.920]   was until like the 1700s in England,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.160]   where she was recognized for using telescopes and so forth.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   But no, they were very keen on that,
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.320]   and they were probably dialed into that
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.840]   and what that portended, as you alluded to,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.160]   for the future of their child.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.200]   I mean, this is a huge biological investment.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.760]   Men don't have that.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.580]   So actually, we are less symmetrical,
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.740]   you know this, than women, right?
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.000]   We have our testes are different lengths or whatever.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.880]   I guess normal men, at least.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.440]   But women are more symmetrical.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.280]   But they're actually,
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.240]   they have an extra timekeeping device
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.680]   that men, we can't relate to that.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.520]   - Their menstrual cycle.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.340]   - Their menstrual cycle, yeah.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.320]   - Yeah, and some women are keenly aware
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.480]   of the ovulation event.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.980]   They will describe it as a feeling,
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.840]   as if it's breaking off and migrating within them.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.480]   And I have every reason to believe them.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   Earlier, you asked, and I know this
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.160]   will get some people's ears pricked up,
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.680]   whether or not when a child is born,
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.400]   with respect to the seasonal cycle,
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.240]   it impacts that child.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.400]   There are a lot of data around this.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.880]   It depends on the environment in which one lives.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.920]   So closer to the equator, it's a very different situation.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.760]   - Equal days all day long.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.980]   - Equal days all day long.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.920]   There were some data,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.200]   and I'd love to get an update on this.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.520]   So somebody knows they can put in the comments
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.840]   that the schizophrenia was far more prevalent
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.800]   as you move away from the equator.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.200]   And then there was a guy at Caltech,
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.280]   he has since passed, but had some interesting data
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   about mothers who contracted influenza
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.160]   during a certain phase of the second trimester,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.840]   heightened probability for schizophrenic offspring.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   But big, big caveat here, none of it was causal, of course.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.720]   And then there are all sorts of interesting things
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.320]   about placental effects.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.640]   And so it's a multivariable thing.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.140]   And we know that because identical twins,
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.240]   even that share the same chorionic sac,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.440]   one can be schizophrenic and the other, no,
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.240]   although there is a higher concordance
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.320]   than if, say, they're a dichorionic, two different sacs.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.480]   But time of birth relative to the seasons,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.680]   seasons correlating, of course,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.720]   with abundance or lack of food,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.120]   abundance or lack of various infectious diseases,
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.960]   influenza in particular, these things are relevant.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.560]   - But we'd have to make a real big stretch
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.160]   to then include the effects of the planet Jupiter,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.240]   which is the biggest planet,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.980]   and is most of the mass of our solar system
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.340]   outside of the sun.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.660]   Then it would be clear,
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   and you could do this test with identical twins
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.500]   that are identical versus fraternal twins,
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.340]   twins that are raised with the same parent.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.720]   You know, some are separated at birth
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.540]   and they turn out very much more similarly
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.780]   when they're identical twins.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.820]   So it shows that genetics play more of a role
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.660]   than we like to think.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.780]   - I mean, genes are powerful.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.620]   - They are.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.780]   - I realize this is a bit politically incorrect
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.300]   to say in certain venues,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.060]   but genes are extremely powerful.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.480]   - Yeah, why wouldn't they be, right?
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.800]   I mean, nurture matters as well,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.360]   but genes are immensely powerful.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.800]   - So, and I think that gives us hope.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.680]   You know, people say, well, we should not be so haughty.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.920]   We should not be so arrogant.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.960]   You know, we have, what, 50% of the same chromosomes
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.800]   as a fruit fly.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.200]   You know, like, who are you to be?
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.720]   And I say, I'll do you one better.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.440]   Like, I think some bonobos have 98% similarity,
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   but that should give us more, you know,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.480]   sort of like treat ourselves and think of ourselves
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.780]   in a way that's more, you know, more elevated, I would say,
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.860]   'cause we're not that.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.020]   There's many species of chimpanzees and primates,
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.980]   and so there's only one human, you know, homo sapien,
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.580]   which, you know, a lot of people don't know.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.220]   The word, you know, homo sapien,
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.140]   which is our species and our genes.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.580]   Sapien doesn't mean, it doesn't mean knowledge, like science.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.860]   Sciencia means knowledge.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.980]   Sapience means wisdom.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.660]   And I like to look at the etymology, I'm fascinated by it,
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.820]   but it kind of highlights what we should be doing
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.960]   and what is it that we are aware of.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.760]   And I'm curious, have you ever encountered, like,
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.920]   why are we called, you know, humans that,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.680]   like, the wise hominid?
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.200]   And it's because we're the only entity, organism,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.880]   that knows it's gonna die.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.200]   Yes, there's some elephants that, you know,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.240]   before one dies and one will take care.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.080]   It's not the same.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.240]   It's like, you knew you were gonna die
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.440]   when you were a kid, very young.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.880]   And it's that awareness of death
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.600]   and the awareness of how special we are,
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.760]   I think that's what invests life with a lot more meaning.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.840]   I don't wanna get too philosophical.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.260]   - It's time perception.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.100]   - That's exactly what I was gonna say.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.380]   - I mean, I'm an expert on happiness sitting here.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.900]   And then Morgan Housel is an expert on the relationship
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.660]   between psychological happiness and money sitting here.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.460]   And he described this cartoon,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.420]   which inevitably makes me chuckle,
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.460]   of a guy and his dog sitting by a lake.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.260]   And there's a bubble, you know,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.300]   sort of bubbles coming out of the guy's head.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.980]   And he's thinking about whatever his stock portfolio
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.100]   and things back home, et cetera.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.020]   And out of the dog's head is just a mirror image
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.860]   of him sitting with his owner.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.160]   The dogs are very present, but what that also means
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.760]   is that they are not able to perceive their own existence
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.480]   within time. - And modeling of time,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.520]   as you said before.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.400]   We can forecast, that's how we,
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.800]   we don't have the strongest muscles,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.940]   the sharpest claws, the biggest teeth, right?
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.780]   What do we have?
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.600]   We have this frontal, prefrontal cortex
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.680]   that allows us to do what are called gedanken
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.000]   or thought experiments, Einstein said.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.960]   To predict the future, to model the future,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.920]   not really predict it, we can't do that.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.840]   But we can model likely outcomes
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.580]   and we can simulate in our minds what those would be like.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.180]   And we're so dependent on that skill
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.820]   that we sometimes confuse correlation for causation.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.260]   And as you know, everyone who confuses correlation
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.660]   with causation ends up dying.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.020]   So it's very dangerous to do that.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.420]   But the point is, the notion
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.100]   of what's called confirmation bias
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.860]   is prevalent in every human being, scientist or not.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.660]   And in fact, as scientists, you and I,
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.420]   we have to guard against that more than anybody
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.440]   'cause nothing really feels better
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.160]   than like thinking of a hypothesis, modeling the future,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.840]   and then feeling like you're right.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.420]   And then you get celebrated and feted.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.820]   Maybe you win a golden medallion
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.960]   with Alfred Nobel's image on it or whatever.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.520]   Those kinds of things are very powerful.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.000]   And those kinds of things are also very dangerous,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.700]   which is why it appeals to so many more people
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.140]   to think that the celestial orbs play a role in our lives.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.400]   It's almost like we've reverted to a paganistic existence
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.880]   where we wanna believe there's some force
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.960]   responsible for our fates, when maybe it's random.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.640]   - I totally agree with you.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.360]   I'll play devil's advocate for a moment,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.680]   not for astrology per se, but for instance,
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.200]   there are many species that use magnetoreception.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.040]   They can sense magnetic fields.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.480]   I think turtles do this, some migrating birds do this,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.440]   and pigeons.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.340]   There's even some evidence that within the,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.560]   I believe this is still true,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.200]   that within the eye of the fly, the fruit fly,
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.960]   that there are some magnetoreceptors.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.800]   So it turns out there are some humans
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.440]   that perform better than chance
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.400]   in a magnetoreception perceptual task.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.480]   This is very surprising to me.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.680]   It can be trained up somewhat,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.900]   but I'm sure there are a number of people hearing this
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.320]   that they themselves feel
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.640]   that they can sense magnetic fields.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.360]   There is a capacity to do that greater than chance
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.200]   in some individuals, it's a very weak capacity.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.360]   So I think humans love the idea
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   that there is something, skills,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   or qualities beyond our reflexive understanding
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.920]   that we all harbor, this idea that we have superpowers
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.060]   that we just need to tap into.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:22.900]   - Sixth sense, right.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.780]   - Sixth sense, or this person has a stroke
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.600]   and suddenly is speaking conversational French,
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.180]   and therefore, neuroplasticity, et cetera.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.860]   - Or what's a proprioception,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   or our colleague, when you were at San Diego, Ramachandra.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.920]   - Oh, Ramachandra.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.800]   - Like the synesthesia, right?
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.160]   - Certainly, synesthesia exists.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.040]   People who will hear a certain key on the piano
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.440]   and it immediately evokes the perception
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.200]   of a particular color, not just red,
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.520]   but a particular shade of red in a very consistent way.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.200]   - Now, if that was useful for something,
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.160]   maybe it is useful, I mean, it might be.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.120]   - Unusual cross-modal plasticity is what we would call it.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.360]   - But so could that not be made into an argument?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.780]   Well, that means that this is a general feature
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.960]   that we just don't know how to access,
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.640]   but maybe we could go to the gym
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.240]   and mental gym or do something to enhance that,
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.080]   like you said.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.040]   I don't know, some people do that with infrared,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.960]   near-infrared wavelengths that they do some kind of training
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.400]   and they claim they can see certain things.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.940]   The question is, how useful is it?
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.040]   And then how predictive is it?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.520]   And I don't think that we can make a case
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.880]   for the predictive elements of the position,
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.040]   as I said, of Mars and Mercury being in retrograde
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.640]   as it is now, like most people.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.280]   But the thing that's shocking is that,
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.160]   look, there's a whole page in almost every newspaper
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.120]   except the excreble New York Times.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.960]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.400]   The New York Times doesn't have--
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.240]   - Are they still around?
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.120]   - They don't. (laughs)
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   It's very interesting.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.960]   I'll tell you off the air a recent encounter I've had
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.080]   with the New York Times.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.760]   But most newspapers have more,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.400]   10, hundreds of times more ink written
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.040]   about astrology than astronomy.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.400]   I mean, it's barely, it'll barely be in there.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.240]   And why is that?
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.480]   It's capitalistic society.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.780]   So people crave this notion that there's some explanation
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.080]   for the random seeming events that occur in their lives.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.140]   And that's an urge as ancient
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.220]   as human civilization itself.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.560]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.160]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.760]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.840]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.280]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.360]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   and it tastes great.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.240]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.700]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.200]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.060]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.380]   to purchase one supplement,
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.420]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.540]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.500]   to eat most of my foods from whole foods
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.320]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.300]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.020]   vegetables, vitamins, and minerals,
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.180]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.100]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.920]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.380]   I sleep well at night, and keep my immune system strong.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.860]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.540]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.220]   my physical health, my mental health,
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.300]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.100]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1,
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.980]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.980]   I also notice, and this makes perfect sense
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.060]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.580]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.020]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.160]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.260]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.740]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.100]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.580]   to claim a special offer.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.260]   For this month only, January, 2025,
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.660]   AG1 is giving away 10 free travel packs
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.540]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.860]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.420]   to claim the 10 free travel packs
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.260]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.340]   It speaks to what I think is one of the core functions
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.700]   of the human brain, which, you know,
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.120]   umbrellas everything we're talking about,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.820]   which is the human brain is a prediction-making machine.
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.980]   And it wants to make predictions on the basis of things
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.700]   that feel reliable.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.420]   And the ability for us to, well, confirmation bias,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.820]   the ability for us to link A and T, as opposed to A, B, C,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.060]   and work through things linearly
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.740]   and try and disprove our own hypotheses
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.060]   is much stronger than any desire
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.780]   to work through things systematically
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.060]   unless you're trained as a scientist.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.900]   - Exactly, yep.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.800]   - And so it's no surprise to me
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.640]   that people want to understand themselves
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.400]   and understand others in a way
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.440]   that feels at least semi-reliable
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.280]   and to do that in a way
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.100]   where they don't have to run a ton of experiments
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.280]   and hence astrology.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.600]   I'd like to stay within this vein of thought,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.440]   but you said something earlier
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.480]   that's been kind of nagging in the back of my brain.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.960]   You said we have two refracting telescopes
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.880]   in the front of our skull.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.640]   I will often remind people that your retinas
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.020]   that line the back of your eyes, like a pie crust,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.080]   are part of your brain, your central nervous system
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.800]   that was literally squeezed out of your skull
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.420]   during the first trimester
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.900]   through a whole genetic program that's very beautiful.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.240]   And this might freak you out, but think about it.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.420]   This is the only portion of your brain
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.520]   that resides outside the cranial vault.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.580]   Technically still in your skull,
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.520]   but outside the cranial vault
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.180]   gives humans an enormous capacity
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.320]   that they wouldn't have otherwise
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.760]   because what you can make judgments about space and time,
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.480]   space based on what's next to what,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.600]   what's far from what,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.560]   and time based on movement of things
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.440]   relative to stationary objects, et cetera,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.800]   that we wouldn't otherwise be able to perform, right?
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.000]   You could sense odors at a distance, smoke, et cetera,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.080]   but it's a whole other business
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.240]   to have these two telescopes.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.560]   Could you explain what you mean
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.480]   by two refracting telescopes?
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.160]   Because I think that will set the stage nicely
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.840]   for some of our other discussion about optics.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   - Yeah, so I've been in love with telescopes
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.800]   since the age of about 12
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.300]   when I could first afford one to buy one of my own.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.400]   And that really came out of the fact
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   that I recognized the limitations of the human eye.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.760]   It turned out I was 12 years old,
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.180]   woke up in the middle of the night one night,
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.360]   there was this incredibly bright light,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.540]   brighter than these lights here,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.080]   shining into my room.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   And I was like, I don't know,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.040]   there's a street light outside and this is crazy.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.580]   Let me look outside and see what it is.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.600]   And it was the moon.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.480]   And I had never seen it.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.560]   It was near a moon set, which is near sunrise, full moon.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.360]   And I looked at it and I kept staring at it.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.120]   And there was a star next to it
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   that kind of looked like a piece of the moon
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.000]   had broken off.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It was that bright and that clear.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.960]   And it's unusual to see these kinds of things together.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.720]   They're actually known as syzygies,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.800]   which is a great Scrabble word.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.880]   If you're ever pressed for a win in Scrabble,
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.760]   use the word syzygy.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.440]   I think it's like 80 points.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.000]   And that just means a conjunction,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.780]   an alignment of astronomical objects.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.620]   I was like, what the hell is this?
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.640]   This is 1984, Andrew, you're younger than me,
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.340]   but Google did not exist for another 16 years.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.680]   And I was kind of impatient.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.560]   I wanted to know what this thing was.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   What is this thing?
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.220]   It's not moving.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.060]   It's not flashing.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.880]   It's not a drone.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.560]   It's not Southwest Airlines, right?
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.400]   So I'm looking at it.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.220]   It's not moving.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.920]   And day after day, it was like that.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.800]   And I was like, how am I gonna find this out?
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   Imagine, we're so blessed that we have the internet
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.800]   and we have these LLMs.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.560]   It's so easy now to be a scientist or do research
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.600]   and anybody can do research.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.680]   Science is for everybody, right?
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.840]   You always highlight that fact.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.400]   So I realized the only way to find out about it
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.100]   was to wait for the New York Times
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.260]   to get delivered on Sunday
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.660]   'cause they did have a section back then
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.660]   that they don't have now called Cosmos.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.160]   And in it, it depicted what the night sky looked like
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.560]   that night, which is a Sunday.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.600]   And that was like three or four days
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.040]   after I had this observation,
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.600]   which I was incredibly observant.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.320]   And I looked at it and it was the moon.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.840]   It showed the moon and it showed Jupiter.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.920]   I was like, what?
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.440]   You can see a planet with your naked eye?
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.120]   This was around the time Voyager
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.920]   was going behind the planets on the grand tour
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   of the solar system, never been done before.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.280]   I was like, I thought you needed a spaceship.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.120]   And I realized that was my first bit
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.680]   of astronomical research.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.240]   And I looked up, I had a hypothesis.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.080]   What is it?
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.900]   I was wrong.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.740]   I thought it was a star.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.580]   It was a planet.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.480]   I was like, this is insane.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.160]   Imagine what I could see if I had a telescope,
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.640]   but I couldn't afford a telescope.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.360]   We were pretty modest means back then.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.920]   I had a job working in a delicatessen down the street.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.480]   And I do that once a week.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.880]   And then I got a grant from a three-letter agency,
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.980]   which is the beginning of many, many scientist careers.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.480]   I got a grant from the MOM agency, my mother.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.860]   She supplemented my $2 an hour salary
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.360]   at the Venice Delicatessen in Dobbs Ferry.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.240]   And I ended up getting a telescope for $75.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.120]   And I cherish this thing.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.440]   And then I was like, oh, let me look at these things
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.480]   in the sky.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   And it's pretty amazing.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.560]   I don't know if you know the history of telescopes,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.280]   but the first ones were invented because of the glass that
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.360]   was present to make eyeglasses.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.240]   So telescopes came from eyeglasses.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.440]   Where was the best glasses?
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   Where were the best glasses made?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.280]   In the Netherlands.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.160]   So actually, the telescope and the microscope
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.320]   were both invented in Holland.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.960]   And the guy who invented the telescope
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.720]   is very interesting because it would be like he
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.440]   made the telescope, but he never thought to look at the night
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.360]   sky with it.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.000]   He only used it as a spyglass to look at objects on the horizon
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.440]   or in a city or whatever.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.320]   He never went like this, looked up at 45.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.920]   That required Galileo.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.440]   So he was my absolute hero of all science.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.080]   We'll talk about him later, maybe.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.400]   Galileo was the first person to ever look up
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.920]   with this telescope.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.200]   And spot objects in the solar system,
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.600]   in the universe, that had never been seen before
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.440]   with a scientific tool.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.000]   So everybody had to use their eyes, back to Tycho Brahe,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.120]   Kepler, Copernicus, they had to use their eyes,
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.040]   which are telescopes.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.960]   I'll get back to that.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.000]   Don't worry.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.240]   I know you afford me the podcaster's predilection
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.600]   of going off on long tangents, but I think this is good.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.280]   Galileo then said, well, I'm going to take this telescope
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.400]   and look at these objects that are otherwise look like stars.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.080]   And in fact, were called, basically,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.400]   wanderers, because they're the only things that moved.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.720]   First looked at the moon.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.880]   Now take yourself back to 1609, when he was first
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.600]   looking at these objects.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.400]   1609, there were no clocks.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.680]   There were no scientific tools of any real virtue.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.640]   He, in fact, would invent many of these things.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.560]   There were simple things like a magnetic compass, a slide rule,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.680]   which none in your main demographic
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.040]   will know what a slide rule is, but that's OK.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.080]   Very simple tools.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.640]   They would use tubes and whatnot.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.480]   But Galileo looked at the moon.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.880]   And the hypothesis was, everything in the universe
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.080]   is orbiting around the Earth.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.480]   The Earth is the most perfect place in the universe,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   because God puts the things that are most important close
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.280]   to him in the center of the universe.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.800]   God is the center of the universe.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.280]   The Catholic Church held this.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.000]   And everything would go around the Earth.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.260]   And in fact, I'm not going to challenge you,
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.520]   because I think you'll defeat me in this.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.800]   But in your audience, there are probably very many educated--
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.380]   I call them .edu people.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.220]   There's many, many educated people.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.760]   I find that even with my brilliant students at UCSD,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.600]   they can't prove that the Earth is not
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.640]   the center of the solar system.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.400]   In other words, I'll say on my astronomy 101 quiz,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.440]   I'll say, prove that the Earth is not
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.040]   the center of the solar system, which was the whole universe
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   back then, right?
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   And I would say it's about 75%, 80% will not get it right.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.680]   In fact, I can say to most people,
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.960]   prove the Earth is not flat.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.080]   I claim the Earth is flat.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.160]   Prove me wrong.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.520]   Most people can't prove it.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.100]   They don't know how the proof is constructed.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.200]   I don't expect them to go and replicate what Aristarchus
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.780]   did 2,000 years ago.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.600]   But this is knowledge we've had for, as I said, 2,000 years.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.880]   The knowledge that the Earth goes around the sun
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.960]   and not the other way around is only about 400 years old.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.840]   But I would say 99%--
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.480]   I know for a fact--
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.520]   I went to Italy, actually, 10 years ago.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.640]   It was the 100th anniversary of Einstein's theory
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.060]   of general relativity.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.160]   And we had a ceremony to honor the first person who
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.120]   ever came up with a theory of relativity, which
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.360]   is also Galileo.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.540]   Galileo had the first notion that relative motion
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.840]   is indistinguishable.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.360]   That if you and I are on a bike and I'm stationary,
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.680]   you can't tell if you're moving.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.180]   I can't tell if I'm stationary.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.640]   That's called relativity of motion.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.120]   Motion is not absolute.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.000]   Einstein would later enhance that, put on steroids,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.880]   and then come up with all sorts of cool stuff
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   that we can get into.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.320]   But this notion that you could do observations,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.340]   that you could use a scientific tool coupled with a hypothesis
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.360]   and then iterate on those hypotheses
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.960]   to make both the instrument better and your hypothesis
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.800]   better, and then expose that to scientific peer review, which
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.440]   was not what we have today, that was done by Galileo.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.040]   He was the first person to use the scientific method.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   What did he use it with?
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.640]   A telescope.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.960]   So a telescope that he used was a refracting telescope.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.200]   Lenses like eyeglasses, two of them,
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.280]   one put at the far end called the objective.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.720]   It's closer to the object.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.900]   The other one, the eyepiece, close to your eye.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.180]   And he was able to magnify things about three to 10 times
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.040]   pretty easily.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.200]   Can you explain refraction for people that--
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.240]   Yeah, so light travels at the fastest speed of any entity.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.720]   Photons travel at roughly 300,000 kilometers per second,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.400]   except when they go into a medium.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.880]   That's what they travel in the vacuum of space,
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.960]   or in a vacuum in my laboratory, or whatever.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.200]   But when they go into a medium that's
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.720]   transparent or translucent, they slow down.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.960]   You can think of it as the light waves themselves.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.120]   Imagine light waves as rows of soldiers marching together.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.240]   And then imagine that they're walking an angle to the beach
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.000]   here in Los Angeles.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.200]   They're marching at an angle.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.840]   The ones that encounter the water first,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.960]   they start to slow down.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.720]   The other ones keep moving at a fast speed.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.160]   And then the whole beam of light,
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.320]   the whole beam of soldiers gets bent.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.240]   That process is called refraction.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.440]   We can do it-- well, this yerba mate is so delicious,
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.940]   we can't do it because it's got a little bit of a cut to it.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.960]   Similar to, for instance, if you go and look at a fountain,
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.240]   and you see a coin.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.000]   And you decide, you're going to be that mischievous kid,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.960]   and you're going to grab that coin.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.280]   So you can throw it back in, like in any--
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.480]   you can recycle the wish.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.200]   And you reach down to grab it, and you
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   miss, because where you see it is not where it actually is.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.700]   Yes.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.440]   Put a pencil in a clear glass of water,
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.920]   same phenomenon will happen.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.120]   That's refraction.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.680]   It's the bending of light by what's
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.840]   called a dielectric, or just a medium that's
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.520]   transparent or translucent.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.720]   And you can do that in a way that you
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.520]   shape the wave of light coming in that will be magnified.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.320]   And that's, in fact, what a telescope does.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.360]   "Tele" means distance, "scope" means viewer.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.800]   So a telescope really means distance viewer.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   A microscope means small thing viewer.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.760]   And so this was kind of revolutionary
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.280]   to use it for scientific purposes.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.360]   Galileo did other things.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   We just take these for granted.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.040]   We've got all these cool cameras here.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.560]   These are all refracting telescopes.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.920]   You can see the lens in one.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.340]   You can see that it's on a tripod.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.720]   Galileo invented the tripod.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.160]   We take these things for granted,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.080]   but people didn't realize that.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.880]   What a stud.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.800]   I want to get a list of all the things that Galileo did.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.600]   I'm going to pause you for one second.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.960]   And please earmark where you're at,
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.880]   because I have a number of questions
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.840]   that I just can't resist asking.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.320]   First of all, if it's too lengthy an answer,
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.920]   feel free to say pass.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.720]   But why was the best glass in Holland?
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.920]   What is it about the Dutch and good glass?
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.760]   I think that they were extremely, as they are now--
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.560]   I have great colleagues that are from the Netherlands--
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.720]   they were obsessed with high quality, as Germans are.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.040]   They were very similar to Germans,
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.000]   into very precise instrumentation
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.680]   and high quality.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.240]   It's interesting to note that glasses were only really
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.460]   invented, in some sense, because of the fact
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.080]   that there was an existing standard
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.600]   for human visual acuity.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.240]   So we all know we go to the eye doctor.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:18.840]   You mean eyeglasses.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.800]   Eyeglasses, yeah.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.320]   So we know today that when you go to the eye doctor,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   there's an eye chart.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.640]   It's called the Snellen chart.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.160]   When you go to the DMV, you use the same thing.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.840]   Numbers and letters of different sizes that,
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.960]   at a given distance, if you can read all of them,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.920]   then you have whatever, high acuity.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.040]   Let's just say high acuity vision.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.580]   We won't get into it yet.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.000]   And if you can only read three lines down
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.920]   and then you're essentially blind to the rest,
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.560]   then you have less than average vision.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.440]   And in the state of California,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.980]   they'll still give you a driver's license.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.360]   There are many people, by the way,
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.440]   there are many people driving in the United States,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.280]   by the way, who qualify as legally blind.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.680]   But because when you drive,
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   you mainly use your peripheral vision,
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.640]   they are granted a driver's license.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.280]   This should terrify everybody.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.160]   But all those eye charts, every DMV here,
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.880]   has the exact same signs for the E at the top, okay?
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.520]   It's a calibration standard.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.480]   How could they do that 400 years ago?
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.240]   We're talking 430 years ago.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.920]   It turns out there was one and only one standard
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.200]   that was acceptable across all of Western Europe.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   It was the Gutenberg Bible.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.520]   The Gutenberg Bible was set in print by Gutenberg,
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.520]   and it had a fixed size of all the characters.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.240]   So what they would do is at a couple of feet,
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.640]   they put the Gutenberg Bible in front of people.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.600]   It's amazing to think about it
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.040]   'cause there's only like 10 copies
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.520]   of the Gutenberg Bible still left.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.360]   They're all in vaults,
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.880]   they're all worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.920]   You can't buy them even if you're, you know, Elon.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.420]   When you look at it, you would be able to tell
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.880]   that you could not see at one foot,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.920]   I could not see what Andrew could see at one foot.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.840]   So you knew that there was something
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.800]   diminishing my visual acuity,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.520]   whether who knows what it was,
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.640]   but they knew that they could then correct that lens
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.480]   to be as good as 20/20 or, you know,
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.960]   get up to your standard for me.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.880]   And that was the way that they would judge
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.400]   how good your eyes were.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.640]   And so they then would correct that with lenses.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.560]   And I always point out how ironic it is
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.220]   because later on, Galileo would take those two lenses,
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.600]   instead of putting one on each eye,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.200]   he'd put one in front of the other one
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.160]   and then use that to construct a telescope.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.200]   But he didn't actually invent the telescope,
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.120]   but he perfected the telescope.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.380]   So just like Apple didn't invent the smartphone,
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.220]   they perfected it.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.400]   Just like Facebook didn't invent social networking,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.560]   they perfected it, right?
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.080]   So it's usually the second mouse gets the cheese,
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.920]   they like to say.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.160]   He was the ultimate second mouse.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.560]   He would always improve things and make them so much better
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.440]   that he would obliterate his competition.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   - Galileo. - Galileo.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.080]   - But it was Copernicus, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.920]   that was the first to say that the earth revolves
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.840]   around the sun while rotating on its axis.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.680]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.320]   - And tilts, which gives us the equinox.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.240]   - Correct, yes.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.000]   - Okay, so Galileo corrected Copernicus about the math,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.660]   but it was Copernicus that gave us
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.740]   the first trusted statement that the earth
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.300]   and the other planets rotate around the sun.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.620]   - Yeah, I would say he gave the hypothesis.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.940]   He wasn't wrong.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.580]   Galileo didn't correct him.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.180]   Galileo brought evidence to the table.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.660]   He brought hard scientific observation.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.740]   - So who was this Copernicus guy?
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.380]   Was he just sort of like a iconoclast?
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.100]   He was like, "Hey, how about we're not the center
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.020]   "of the universe, it's the sun that's the center of universe?"
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.700]   - Well, so what was the milieu of the time
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.820]   was that the earth was the center of the universe,
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.380]   which was, our solar system effectively
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.240]   was the whole universe.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.060]   They didn't know about stars and galaxies, certainly.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.700]   We can get into that later.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.940]   But there was what's known as the Ptolemaic concept
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.340]   of the organization of the cosmos.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.260]   So the earliest cosmological models were that
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.440]   the sun is the center, the earth is the center
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.860]   of the universe, and everything goes around it.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.220]   However, these were not dopes.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.060]   They knew that there were problems with that model.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:45.780]   There are certain aspects of the orbits of planets.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.300]   For example, I mentioned Mercury's retrograde,
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.300]   and what does retrograde mean?
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.300]   We don't have to get into it, but there are anomalies
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.500]   that the planets will undergo at different times
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.420]   of the year due to the fact that the earth is,
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.580]   and we know now, rotating, revolving around the sun,
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.480]   and rotating on its axis, but the main effect
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.940]   is its revolution around the sun.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.060]   And the other planets are, too, in the same plane,
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.220]   the zodiac plane, what's called the ecliptic
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.060]   due to the angular momentum of the proto-solar system.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.280]   And sometimes the earth goes faster than, say, Jupiter,
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.700]   so originally it'll be out in front, if you will,
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.500]   of the planet, you know, forward center of motion,
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.860]   as you like to say, and then it'll be behind it later on.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.660]   And so it looks like Jupiter is making
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.540]   like this weird S-curve, and they couldn't explain that
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.460]   if the earth is the center of the solar system,
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.440]   except that they added on what are called epicycles.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.300]   They added on extra little orbits of the planets
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.860]   in order to account for that motion
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.560]   that sometimes it appears, yes, we're moving bulk motion,
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.340]   but then sometimes it goes in the opposite direction
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.940]   when we're going in the same direction.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:41.780]   - So smart.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.600]   - Yeah, they were very smart.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.980]   - And they must have known by modeling this stuff
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.020]   on earth, between objects on earth.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:47.860]   - 100%.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.460]   - And that raises, for me anyway,
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.060]   an important psychological question.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:57.060]   So you've got these Dutch folks with great glass,
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.140]   they're using that great glass to correct vision.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.620]   - I should say, sorry, Andrew,
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.780]   the reason that they had good glass
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:07.300]   is they were some of the foremost explorers, right?
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.940]   A lot of the early trade, and they were,
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.260]   what did exploration give them?
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.480]   Access to trade.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.880]   So they could get the finest silicon and glass,
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.420]   and they could make it themselves.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.740]   That's their economics.
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.620]   Again, capitalism always wins, right?
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.500]   This is a lesson that we shouldn't forget.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.300]   Their commerce, their economies allowed them to do trade
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.180]   and acquire the best, highest quality materials.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.140]   Then that was used to make the best scientific equipment.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.060]   And it's just curious, it'd be like,
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.420]   if they built these scientific tools,
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.620]   but they didn't use them for science.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.420]   So imagine building the Large Hadron Collider,
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.740]   or SLAC, or something like that.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.960]   And then not using it, just using it to measure-
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.760]   - I think SLAC is sitting empty, right?
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.600]   - It basically is.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.840]   But it wasn't originally, that's the point.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.400]   - Right, it was used for something.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.640]   So what I'm curious about is,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   why do you think it is that some humans get some technology,
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.440]   in this case, glass,
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.080]   and they want to look at things that are very close up?
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.680]   I like microscopes a lot.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.560]   Right now, I don't have my wet lab.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.360]   We're still involved in some clinical trials.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.880]   But I love microscopes,
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.000]   and I loved customizing my microscopes.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.240]   I didn't like them, I don't like a plug and play.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.960]   I like them sort of the same way that people like hot rods.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.260]   I didn't like motorized stages.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.860]   I like manual stages, this kind of thing.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.920]   Nowadays, you need motorized stages, et cetera.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.040]   But what was I gonna invest my money into?
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.720]   It was higher numerical aperture.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   - Yes.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.520]   - Basically, you're able to see things better.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.640]   - Deeper, yeah.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.200]   - Exactly, see smaller things better.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.340]   That's what numerical aperture will do for you.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.980]   So, it's like putting more horsepower into a car,
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.820]   as opposed to paying more attention to the paint job.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.940]   - People do it with their cameras.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:46.780]   - Sure.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.600]   - They geek out.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.380]   - Right, everyone's got their thing.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.660]   Humans have this glass,
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.180]   and they have the option to look at smaller
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.820]   and smaller things, or to resolve their vision.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.400]   Why do you think it is that a subset of humans?
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.860]   'Cause I think it's a special subset of humans.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:05.220]   Instead, I'm like, I wanna look at things really far away.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.940]   You know, and you're one of these humans.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.340]   I mean, I delight in the stars.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.160]   I delight in the moon.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.620]   I have some questions about,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.780]   that I think most people have who appreciate sunsets
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.500]   and moonsets and things like that.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:18.060]   But why do you think it is that it tends
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.360]   to be a small subset of people
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.300]   who don't just wanna appreciate the night sky,
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.080]   but wanna figure this stuff out that is so far away?
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.920]   I'll be honest, it never occurred to me.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.780]   I'm curious about things deep under the ocean.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.620]   - Yeah.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.540]   - I am very interested in fish and aquatic life.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.620]   But I like terrestrial things,
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.260]   arboreal things, things in trees.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.700]   And I think most people orient
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.300]   to the stuff that's more of this planet.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.140]   - Yeah.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:48.980]   - But what do you think it is?
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.300]   I realize you're not a psychologist
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.500]   and there's probably no DSM-whatever,
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.140]   six diagnosis specific for this.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.100]   - I check 'em all off, yeah.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.100]   - But I'll just ask you, for you,
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.780]   was it a desire to better understand life here on Earth,
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.260]   or was it a desire to kind of leave life here on Earth?
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.180]   - I think it's a latter.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:08.380]   I mean, my childhood was pretty tumultuous.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.220]   I think you and I have a lot of things in common,
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:15.180]   both fathers, scientist and physics and math in my case.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.080]   Very hard driving, very hard to live up
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.820]   to their shadows that they cast, for example,
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   at least in my case.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.420]   And you seem to have just a beautiful relationship
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   with your dad now, but I'm sure it wasn't always like that.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.380]   In fact, you talked about that.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.540]   - We did a lot of repair work,
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.940]   and I'm very grateful for where we're at.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.900]   And I encourage anyone, son, daughter, mother, father,
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.020]   whatever relationship, that the repair work,
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.500]   to the extent that it's possible, is absolutely worth it.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.060]   - Yeah, and that episode, how they texted you,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.780]   is a real gift, not only for all of us
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.380]   who got to witness it, but also for grandchildren,
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.700]   him, his legacy and so forth,
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:54.780]   and even your dad's wife and your mom.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.740]   But the point is, yes, it transported me.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.820]   I was living through, after the divorce of my parents,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.540]   I lived with my stepfather, who had adopted us,
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.180]   changed our names, moved to different,
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.780]   we were changing schools every couple of years.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:12.660]   And that discovery of the moon next to Jupiter,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.900]   it was sort of like solving a puzzle.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.580]   And there's a famous saying by Albert Michelson,
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:21.020]   who was the first Nobel Prize winner in American history.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:21.940]   - For what?
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.780]   - Physics, sorry.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.580]   Michelson morally, he proved, in some sense,
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.260]   that the Earth is not moving through the ether,
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.700]   that was hypothesized by luminaries beforehand.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:35.740]   But the point was, when a child solves a puzzle,
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.420]   like, you would think, well, like an adult,
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.220]   you solve a Rubik's Cube, okay, I did it once,
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.260]   I don't have to do it again.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.900]   But my son, he'll keep doing it.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.520]   I'll keep showing off, can I get a faster video game?
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.820]   Same thing, once you solve the video,
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.300]   you don't just throw it out and stop doing it.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.420]   You get a taste of that thrill of discovery.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.540]   Yes, it's diminished, and yes, we become inured to it
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.020]   as we get older and a little bit more,
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.420]   there's just things we have to take care of in life,
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.620]   and especially as a professor scientist,
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.100]   you can't marvel over the same things you did
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.800]   when you first did these experiments.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.300]   But as an experiment, you get transported,
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.340]   and you get to encounter something
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.820]   that you feel like no one has ever done before.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.100]   For example, when I got my first telescope that night,
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.400]   a couple of months after discovering this,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.660]   I looked through it and I saw the same features on the moon,
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.960]   and I have a 3D-printed moon that my son made to show you,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.560]   and it has all the craters represented on it, so cool.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.040]   And I saw the exact same craters on the moon
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.320]   that Galileo saw, and then I looked at Jupiter,
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.020]   and when you look at Jupiter,
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.520]   you not only see these beautiful atmospheric bands on it,
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.560]   and I brought you a telescope
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.240]   as your end-of-the-year holiday gift.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.000]   It's yours to keep, no money down.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.840]   - Thank you.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.800]   - Keating brand telescope. - Thanks for the gift.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.080]   - And I looked at Jupiter, and when you look at Jupiter,
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.120]   as I hope you'll do tonight or with your crew later on,
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.080]   you will see not only the planet,
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.840]   not only its little atmospheric stripes,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.740]   maybe even the great red spot, which is amazing,
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.760]   three times bigger than the Earth.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.680]   You can see it from Earth with this little telescope,
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.700]   I got you, but you see four little stars,
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.960]   and they're four stars that are to the left, to the right.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   They're in a plane with the midpoint
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.840]   of these equatorial storms that are brewing on Jupiter.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.800]   We know that they've been going on for at least 400 years
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.200]   'cause Galileo saw them, so that sets a limit,
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.360]   a minimum-- - Storms, when you say storms,
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.200]   what do these storms consist of?
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.360]   - Hurricanes, they're enormous hurricanes on the planet,
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.480]   and the equatorial bands, like the Tropic of Cancer
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.720]   and the Tropic of Capricorn.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.600]   - So there's plenty of water up there that's raining down?
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.720]   - No, it's not water at all.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.480]   It's methane, ammonia, but it's a fluid,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.280]   so it behaves like a fluid doesn't,
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.200]   so you have these swirling whirls,
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.880]   and the colors will amaze you.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.400]   You'll see colors on an astronomical object.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.280]   It's gonna blow your mind, and not only is it gonna blow
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.360]   your mind 'cause you're doing it,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.660]   you're gonna feel unique in all of science.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.880]   You will feel what Galileo felt.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.160]   You won't know that he felt it before you.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.880]   A billion people have seen it since then
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.360]   because for you, it's new, and for you,
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.320]   you're viscerally connected to the maestro, to Galileo,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.280]   and what he did, and there's no other branch of science
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.160]   that's like that.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.720]   You can't look at the Higgs boson.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.080]   First of all, no one person did it.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.340]   It's a team of 3,700 people that discovered the Higgs boson,
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.360]   and seven people predicted the Higgs boson.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.560]   Higgs is just one of 'em.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.400]   One of my professors at Brown was another one,
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   Jerry Gralnick, he passed away, unfortunately,
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.720]   never won the Nobel Prize, but the point is,
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.440]   you can't know what that felt like.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.600]   You can't know what it felt like
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.520]   to discover gravitational waves
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.220]   'cause thousands of people did it recently in 2015,
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.320]   but the question of visceral connection
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.760]   to the first discoverer of that phenomena,
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.840]   it's unique to astronomy.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.080]   I don't know of another branch of science
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   where you can have that, and best of all,
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.240]   from here in the center of L.A.,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.920]   you can see the same craters.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.520]   You can see these four Galilean,
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.760]   they're called the Galilean moons of Jupiter,
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.640]   and we're sending spacecraft there now
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.080]   to see if they have life on it.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.000]   It's incredible, Andrew.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.320]   There's nothing else like that in all of science.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.880]   For $50 to $60, I have a list on my website,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.280]   briankeating.com, I have a telescope buyer's guide
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.400]   that I send to people.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   I don't make any money from it,
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.160]   it's just I love to share science with the public,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.240]   just like you, but in my case, it's astronomy,
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.360]   and for $50 or $75, you can have this experience
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   that Galileo had.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.320]   It's an awesome feeling,
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.800]   and I think that's what kept me going.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.720]   It distracted me from the pains of the life
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.240]   that I had at that time, and just struggling
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.140]   as most pre-teens and teenagers did.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.980]   You know, but to answer your question
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.700]   that you asked 20 minutes ago,
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.340]   it was really to transport, teleport,
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.100]   exactly the opposite of the telescope.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.700]   I really felt like I was transported
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.700]   to these other worlds, and that I could understand them
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.700]   with simple math and simple tools.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.900]   Night after night, they were reliable companions
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.420]   and that people loved to see it.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.580]   You'll see Saturn, hopefully, with it.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:45.340]   You can't help but feel, this is, you know, amazing.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.060]   It's thrilling, and it allows you to do science
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.460]   with your eyes, connected to your mind.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:52.880]   It's incredible.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.700]   - So it sounds to me like you were,
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.060]   thank you for sharing that, by the way.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.380]   It sounds like you were able to connect
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:02.980]   to places distant in space, obviously,
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.680]   and time, Galileo.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.820]   That's beautiful.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.920]   I don't think the same experience occurs
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.300]   when one looks down the microscope,
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.380]   and it's true that the greatest neurobiologist
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.860]   of all time, by a long shot,
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.980]   was Ramon y Cajal, right?
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.620]   Supernatural levels of ability to understand
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.900]   what turned out to be the correct function
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.980]   of the nervous system, just from anatomical specimens.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.460]   But when I look down the microscope,
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.420]   and I see even a Cajal-Retzius cell,
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.240]   there's a cell named after him,
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.380]   you don't really feel a connection to him in the same way,
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.060]   although the neurons are beautiful,
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.300]   but it's not the same, the way that you described.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.100]   - What's great about science, in general,
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.300]   is that the best science is apolitical.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.980]   But I always say, look, there's no such thing as like,
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.780]   oh, well, that constellation is a democratic constellation.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.060]   Oh, see that asteroid?
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.620]   That's a, no, it is a safe space.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.300]   I think we do need safe spaces,
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.360]   and that best science is a safe space,
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.700]   not meaning it never interacts with politics,
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.420]   'cause of course it does, but for those moments,
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.340]   we, as humans, and you know this better than I do,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.340]   we need recovery.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.460]   You can't just work out,
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.820]   you don't work out seven days a week.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.220]   You work out six days a week, or whatever.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.500]   It's still more than, six more than I work out.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.440]   But the point is, we need to recover
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.420]   as much as we need to pay attention to the activity.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.720]   We need to recover, pay attention to that too.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.780]   And so the question is, where can we recover
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.100]   from social media, from politics, from economic stress?
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.460]   I think science is an ideal vehicle for it.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.080]   It should be apolitical.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.940]   We shouldn't be always concerned with politics,
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.220]   or what's happening on social media.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.220]   And I'm guilty of this too.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:46.140]   I'm certainly spending way too much time on screens.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.500]   But the point being, science can be that.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.620]   And astronomy in particular, like I said,
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.420]   it's apolitical, it is safe to let your mind run
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.780]   to what you used to do when you were on a dorm
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.840]   with your bros at 3 a.m., just BSing, right?
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.020]   We don't get a chance to do that
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.400]   when you're thinking about mortgage payments,
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.320]   and who's taking the kids tomorrow,
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.380]   and all these different quotidian things.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.760]   I say, we need to get back to that more than ever, I feel.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.300]   - Pondering the origins of life,
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.620]   and connecting to people who existed
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.340]   thousands of years before us.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.080]   Do you think that Galileo, Copernicus,
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.820]   and others were doing the exact same thing?
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.800]   That there was a bit of an escapism to it,
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.500]   healthy escapism, as opposed to trying to solve
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.520]   the position of the planets and understand ourselves
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.740]   for some other reason?
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.580]   - Definitely, yeah.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.380]   I mean, Galileo in particular is sort of this tragic figure.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.220]   In some ways, he had the first notions
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.740]   and application of the scientific method,
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.340]   as I said, using an apparatus to confirm a hypothesis,
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.420]   iterating on that.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.740]   So I said, when he saw the moon,
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.940]   he saw these craters, and valleys, and rifts,
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.620]   and lava fields that you'll see tonight.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.820]   Again, people, you can buy a telescope on Amazon, $50,
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.380]   and you'll see these same things that he saw,
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.180]   and you can connect it to your iPhone
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.020]   and post it on Instagram if you want.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.880]   And I hope you'll do that.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.300]   That's your only homework assignment.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.500]   The only one I'm gonna assign to you as a professor.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.540]   So I want you to take a picture of the craters on the moon.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.380]   But the point is, you'll see the exact same things.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.700]   From New York City, you can see them.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.060]   From the middle of London, it doesn't matter where you are.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.380]   If you have a clear sky and the moon is out,
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.400]   you'll see the same thing.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.140]   But when you look at Jupiter, you'll see these four dots.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.880]   And here's where Galileo just had this otherworldly intellect
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.780]   that when I saw those, I was like, oh, cool,
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.740]   it's next to some stars.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.260]   Until I realized, I had to do more research,
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.100]   that those are actually the moons of Jupiter.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.060]   So in one night, tonight, you can quadruple
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.100]   the number of moons you've ever seen in your life.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.660]   And some of those moons are almost the size of our moon.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.720]   Our moon is unusually large.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.980]   And those moons, sometimes they'll cast shadows
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.900]   on the planet, so there'll be an eclipse.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.300]   You'll witness an eclipse on Jupiter, on another planet,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.680]   with this $50 instrument, or whatever, okay?
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.300]   When he was observing these things,
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:56.060]   he would do things that were not only psychological,
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.540]   and they were therapeutic for him in his later years,
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.060]   I'll explain that in a minute, he ended up going blind.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.180]   And so, losing the sight, the recollections that he had.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.460]   And he lost his daughter, who was a nun,
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.660]   because she was illegitimate, as most of,
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.620]   I think all of his kids, except maybe one, his oldest one.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.920]   He had mistresses, he was married, divorced, basically,
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.380]   and he was Catholic in Italy, primordial Italy, basically.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.780]   It didn't exist as a country, but he was in Tuscany.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:26.060]   And he had a lot of challenges, he was almost always broke.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.740]   Even when he invented his version of the telescope,
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.320]   again, he didn't invent the telescope,
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.860]   but he made it so much better.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.620]   10x'd it, 20x'd it, you know, zero to one,
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.140]   and it was incredible what he did with it.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.060]   He realized, this is great and all,
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.300]   for me to discover these cool things,
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.380]   and learn about the universe, he was deeply religious, too.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.700]   But I gotta make money, I gotta pay for my house,
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.740]   he had like, imagine like, your students at Stanford
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.060]   are living with you, because that's the only way
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.100]   you can afford to pay rent in your, I mean,
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.540]   and you're cooking meals for them.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.240]   And they're like, slobs, right?
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.080]   I mean, like, I was a slob in college, right?
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.060]   So the point is, he had bills to pay,
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.460]   and he was a businessman.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.420]   He realized, well, look, if I start making these telescopes,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.300]   everybody will see the things that I'm seeing.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.380]   I won't have any monopolistic advantage over, you know,
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.620]   Kepler, who is his friend, but also his competitor.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.540]   They were really vying for who is the best astronomer
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.880]   of all time, Kepler in Germany,
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.780]   and obviously Galileo in Italy, well, become Italy.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.940]   And he realized Kepler was purely theoretical.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.900]   He had great math chops, he came up with functions
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.480]   for the orbits of planets before Isaac Newton proved
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.760]   that they came from calculus and universal gravitation,
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.880]   incredible scientist.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.240]   But if he gave that, it was like giving, you know,
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.140]   a free particle accelerator to your arch competitors, right?
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.980]   He didn't do that.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.280]   He said, no, I'm not gonna make these telescopes,
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.000]   but I'm gonna sell them only to the government,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.040]   and they're gonna pay me
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.320]   because these are great military devices.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.020]   And you know, we don't think of them now,
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.160]   but with it, he went, he's so brilliant.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.680]   He was so charming and charismatic.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.260]   He said, I'm not only gonna sell you these things.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.680]   First, he went to the Senate in Venice,
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.200]   the Venetian Senate, the Doge, the original Doge.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.120]   We think Doge is a coin or some department
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.440]   that Elon's gonna head.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.480]   No, no, the Doge was like the chief of the government
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.520]   back in the Venetians,
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.180]   which was one of the most wealthy countries
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.280]   in all of Europe.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.160]   It was separate from Tuscany and separate from Rome.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.240]   And he went there and he said, you are a maritime,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.720]   have you ever been to Venice?
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.560]   It's beautiful, right?
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.160]   So he said, look, come with me.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.480]   I'm gonna take you up into the Piazza San Marco,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.800]   go up to the tower, and we're gonna look out
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.720]   and we're gonna see there's a ship out there,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.520]   but you can't see it with your naked eye.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.960]   But if I give you the telescope,
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.240]   you can see it three days earlier
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.960]   before it comes into your harbor.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   That's like you have an F-35, you know, stealth fighter,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.560]   and you sell the rights to turn off the stealth part of it
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.600]   to your adversary, and it's incredibly valuable.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.720]   - It's a time portal.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.540]   - Yes.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.000]   - You know, you can tell I'm keep harping on this theme
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.400]   of, you know, the ability to see things
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.240]   in greater distance.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.360]   - That's right.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.320]   - At higher and higher resolution gives you
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.160]   - That's right.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.640]   - A window into time.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.960]   - Exactly, and we speak of that now.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.460]   - That has enormous advantage.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.300]   - Exactly.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.440]   - There, because of, you know, the trajectory of the ship.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.280]   - Yeah.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.320]   - You actually are getting a sort of crystal ball
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.000]   into what's gonna happen later.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.840]   - Predicting the future, as you said, yeah.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.120]   - Whereas looking at position of the stars,
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.200]   some anticipation of what's gonna happen
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.720]   based on historical charts of the stars.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.480]   - Exactly, and we even speak of that now,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.600]   and come to think of it, as you're saying it, light years.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.600]   What is a light year?
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.060]   It's a measurement of distance, but it's in terms of time.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.120]   So it's exactly what, consonant with what you're saying.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.600]   We are always gonna have this combination,
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.160]   this interrelation, this, you know, competition
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.040]   between things in space and things in time.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.400]   And he realized with this tube that he could see
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.720]   the great distances that also afforded him
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.160]   this extra advantage when it came to predicting the future,
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.400]   as you said.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.760]   - If we could do a top contour survey
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   of the greats of astronomy, where would it start?
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.600]   Starting with people who got it wrong,
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.320]   and then correct each other.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.600]   Like, if we were gonna do a fast sprint through these,
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.720]   where would we start?
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.480]   - Well, you'd have to start with like, you know,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.240]   Gog or whatever, you know, the first cavemen and women,
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.440]   you know, as I said, the 40--
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.640]   - Charting stars on the wall of the cave.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.920]   - Exactly, we don't know who they are.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.880]   - Telling their youngsters, like, okay, you know,
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.560]   because those stars are there relative to that ridge,
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.320]   or that, et cetera.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.100]   Days are getting longer, days are getting shorter.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.940]   - That's right.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.940]   - Ergo hunt now, ergo collect stuff to hunker down.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:34.400]   Maybe even don't reproduce now.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.840]   Maybe even behavioral restraint.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.680]   - 100%.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.560]   - Maybe reproduce now.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560]   - Yeah, it's gonna be much more, you know,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.840]   optimal time for that, exactly.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.260]   So tens of thousands, pre-antiquity, you would say.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.800]   Then the, I would say, fast forward, you know,
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.480]   to the maybe Egyptian epoch, you know, 5,000 BCE,
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.160]   so to speak, when they had a, also a very zodiological
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.900]   and astrological conception of these objects.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.080]   But, and yet they would build things, you know,
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.120]   in relation to the positions of stars and constellations.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.240]   - Sundial emerges.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.320]   - Sundial, obelisks, you know,
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.080]   things that were used, primitive things.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.740]   Stonehenge also, I think it's like 20,000 years ago.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.740]   They believe it's related to some astronomical observations.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.560]   They're not entirely certain about that.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.880]   - We have to double click on Stonehenge.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.080]   How do you think it got there?
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.360]   - You know, it's one of those great mysteries that's,
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.960]   I think it's less controversial,
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.000]   Stonehenge than the pyramids.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.400]   The pyramids seem to be like almost, you know,
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.520]   they lead people into thinking about aliens
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.440]   and all sorts of stuff.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.600]   - But what do you think of, is it, I mean,
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.620]   given their mass, given their location,
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.440]   given what we knew about populations then,
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.320]   and given what we know about the strength of people
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.560]   and the tools they had at the time,
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.700]   is it reasonable to assume that people built these things?
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.240]   - I mean, certainly, I mean, you'd have to convince me
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.760]   that people didn't build them,
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.000]   but exactly how they built it is a great question.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.840]   I mean, so for example, I mentioned this
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.880]   when I was on Joe Rogan's show.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.180]   I said, you know, if you measure the bases of the pyramids,
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.880]   it turns out that their ratio of a cubit,
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.620]   which is actually cubits, not quantum bits,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.920]   like you and your dad talked about,
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.960]   but cubits is the length of the pharaoh's forearm.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.720]   It's basically a foot and a half, roughly.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.340]   So back then, if you were like the president,
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.640]   you were also the metric standard for all of civilization.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.480]   - Wild.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.320]   - And it makes us--
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.940]   - Sort of like models on Instagram, right?
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.600]   Everyone's trying to attain these.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.640]   What's the standard?
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.480]   - That's right, exactly.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.320]   - What's the standard?
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.140]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:28.980]   - Wild, so the pharaoh's forearm,
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.600]   and is this about carrying items?
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.920]   - Yeah, well, it was just for length or like a foot.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.520]   We talk about a foot, it was a pharaoh's foot.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.880]   Yeah, that's where we get those from, right?
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.560]   So there was only kind of one rough standard
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.720]   for calibration, which is incredibly important
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.760]   for removing systematic effects in science in general.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.280]   So you had a calibration standard.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.280]   Now we have like a bar of platinum.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.680]   We've defined the second in terms of oscillations
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.880]   of a certain atom called cesium
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.280]   and how many times it oscillates per second.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.400]   - Sure, a degree, right?
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.080]   Yeah, a calorie, right?
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.720]   - So now we want to define those
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.720]   in terms of physical quantities, not in terms of people.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.760]   And so doing that has been a great advance
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.080]   forward in science, and we've only recently
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.800]   gotten rid of what are called artifacts.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.520]   So it used to be there was a rod that was one meter long,
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.020]   and the meter was originally defined as 69,000,
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:21.000]   I forget, of the distance from the North Pole to Paris.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.760]   But that obviously depends on assuming
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.880]   the earth is a perfect sphere, which it's not, right?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.160]   - It's kind of chubby around the middle, right?
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.000]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.160]   Bulges because it's an oblate sphere, right, exactly.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.520]   And so all these things that were relics,
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.880]   we want to get rid of them and tie them
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.440]   to fundamental properties of, say, a quantum system
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   that's very pure and we can isolate it.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.920]   We don't want to use a pharaoh's foot either,
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.780]   so we have to come up with a length standard.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.920]   So now we use the speed of light times the second,
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.880]   and we can define things in those terms.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.600]   But back then, yeah, so they didn't know that.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.320]   But I told Joe, as I said, if you measure the base
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.960]   of all the great pyramids at Giza,
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.080]   they're all multiples of a cubit
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.400]   times so many numbers of the number pi.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.960]   So like, but pi wasn't known to them.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.320]   You know, pi wasn't known to be irrational to the Greeks,
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.820]   and Euclid proved that it was irrational,
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.880]   and that, you know, it didn't come from a computational,
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.240]   it couldn't easily be obtained from,
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.560]   it had an infinite number of digits, right?
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.240]   So how did these Egyptians know that?
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.880]   An alien told them, no.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.480]   The way they did it is they laid it out,
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.080]   they used a surveyor's tool.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.720]   One of the surveyor's tool is a stick with a wheel on it.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.480]   So the wheel's a circle, so you've got so many multiples,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.840]   they just count it, and that's how,
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.360]   so we confuse a lot of things.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.440]   - So they stumbled into pi.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.000]   - Exactly, right, they walked all over.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.600]   So you don't have to always posit
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.680]   supernatural explanations for things.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.480]   The answer is simply, we don't know,
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.080]   I certainly don't know how Stonehenge was built,
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.360]   nor do I know how the pyramids were built,
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.320]   but it's not, you would have to convince me
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.880]   that it was built by some other means
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.440]   other than people and the tools that were available to them.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.840]   - Yeah, likewise, I'm not convinced
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.040]   it came from extraterrestrial sources.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.760]   - Yes, I don't remember how we got on this, but timekeeping.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.880]   - So we were marching through,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.960]   so we have our ancient ancestors,
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.360]   and then at what point do we get to
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.860]   Copernicus and Galileo?
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.780]   - Then it was, yeah, then it was Copernicus who had ideas,
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.720]   but couldn't prove them, he had no data
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   to substantiate the Copernican
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.320]   or sun-centered model of the universe,
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.960]   which is also, by the way,
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.120]   almost everything in science is wrong, right?
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.480]   Copernicus is wrong.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.520]   The sun is not the center of the solar system, right?
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.220]   The center of our solar system is inside the sun
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.840]   because the planets orbit around it,
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.200]   and they orbit around an elliptical pattern,
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.600]   which has two foci.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.880]   So he believed the orbits were all circles.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.040]   So he's wrong, but he's more right than Aristotle,
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.740]   so that's how science progresses, right?
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.240]   Newton was right about gravity until he was wrong
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.860]   when Einstein proved him wrong, right?
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.280]   So then you come up to, after him,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.760]   Kepler discovered the laws of the elliptical motion
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.720]   of planets and their patterns that we still use.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.200]   We discovered an exoplanet, my colleague David Kipping,
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.680]   I wanna introduce you to, he's discovered exomoons.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   These are moons around other planets,
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.520]   some of which are in the habitable zone of their host star,
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.480]   and some of them have sun-like stars
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.760]   and are Earth-sized planets, it's incredible.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.080]   There could be, as I said,
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   a link between life evolving on Earth
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.280]   due to the moon on our planet.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.440]   So too, on an exoplanet, it could require an exomoon,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.800]   which he's discovered, or thinks he has,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.680]   he's actually very cautious and hasn't said it explicitly.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.780]   So Kepler's laws underpin all those discoveries,
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.680]   even to this day, 400 years later.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.480]   Then Galileo, immediately afterwards with the telescope,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.000]   phases of Venus that only occur
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.420]   if the Earth is not the center of the solar system.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.200]   The rings of Saturn, he had notions about those.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.020]   He accidentally discovered the planet Neptune.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.880]   It's amazing.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.960]   And then he, of course, the moons of Jupiter falsified
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.360]   the notion that the Earth is the center of the solar system
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.960]   because these moons are going around Jupiter,
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.800]   not around the Earth.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.440]   So that's completely torpedoed the notion
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.320]   of the true nature of the Aristotelian
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   or Ptolemaic Earth-centered cosmology.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.320]   Then soon after that, astronomers measured things
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.720]   like the speed of light using eclipses of the moons
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.600]   of Jupiter, they measured distances to Saturn,
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.540]   they mapped out the solar system,
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.580]   and then from there, using parallax,
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.900]   you can kind of gauge the triangulation
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.460]   and using trigonometry measure the structure of our galaxy.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:19.620]   William Herschel and his sister, Caroline Herschel,
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.740]   was the first female astronomer, first female scientist.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.100]   She was the first person to use the scientific method
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.720]   and become a fellow of the Royal Society in Great Britain.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.520]   And then later off after that,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.780]   we come to the era of the last kind of,
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.440]   the big developments in technology
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.380]   were photographic plates after that,
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.020]   spectrographs, dispersion of light
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.880]   onto photographic material.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.180]   You could preserve it in memory,
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:46.580]   you didn't use sketches like Galileo did.
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.880]   And then up until Hubble,
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.860]   when Hubble discovered two major things,
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.620]   which was one was that the Milky Way was a galaxy,
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.940]   it wasn't the entire universe,
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.000]   there were other galaxies, island universes
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.580]   of billions of stars.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.420]   And then he discovered the expansion of the universe
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.340]   with help from an astronomer
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.420]   who doesn't get a lot of attention.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.220]   A lot of the women in astronomy got really short shrift.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.780]   People discovered how fusion works in the sun,
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:13.060]   women, Carol Gaspatchian at Harvard,
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.620]   and then Henrietta Leavitt,
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.620]   who measured this relationship between the size
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.100]   and brightness of objects called Cepheid variables
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.500]   that Hubble then used to make his law
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.780]   that proved that the universe is expanding.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.700]   And then after that, people like Penzias and Wilson
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.300]   discovering the microwave and radio astronomy,
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.900]   Robert Jansky, all the way up until,
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.460]   my colleagues today, some of whom I've interviewed,
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.740]   Adam Rees and Brian Schmidt and Barry Barish,
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.660]   who wrote the foreword to my second book,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:42.980]   detecting gravitational waves,
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.900]   the accelerating expansion of the universe
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.380]   due to dark energy,
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.380]   first Nobel Prize in astronomy in 2011,
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:53.420]   followed up 2017 discovery of gravitational waves
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.220]   from in-spiraling black holes.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.460]   There's so many and there's so many,
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.720]   I've been blessed to know many of them
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.900]   and to have them as my academic pedigree.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.260]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.940]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.580]   I recently became a Function member
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.860]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:12.860]   to lab testing.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.780]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.780]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.380]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.260]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.060]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.320]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.780]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.500]   Function not only provides testing
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.620]   of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.480]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:41.040]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.900]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.020]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.320]   This was totally surprising to me.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.140]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.000]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.480]   but offered medical doctor informed insights
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.160]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.480]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.240]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.600]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.500]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.560]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:13.320]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.880]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.300]   is so important for health.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.080]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.000]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.500]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.400]   both at the level of ease of use,
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.880]   that is getting the test done,
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.800]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.200]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.440]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.760]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:39.040]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.640]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.240]   but they're offering early access
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.480]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.760]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.920]   to get early access to Function.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.280]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.200]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.160]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.480]   Now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.400]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.280]   is the foundation of mental health,
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.800]   physical health, and performance.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.280]   Now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.680]   in the quality of sleep that you get each night.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.840]   How soft that mattress is, or how firm it is,
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.360]   how breathable it is, all play into your comfort
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.000]   and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.420]   So if you go to the Helix website,
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.240]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.200]   that asks you questions such as,
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.400]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.120]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   Things of that sort.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.760]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.600]   maybe you don't.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.880]   Either way, Helix will match you
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.720]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.400]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.280]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.660]   about three and a half years ago,
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.720]   and it's been far and away the best sleep
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.540]   that I've ever had.
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.960]   So much so that when I travel to hotels and Airbnbs,
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.240]   I find I don't sleep as well.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.640]   I can't wait to get back to my Dusk mattress.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.960]   So if you'd like to try Helix,
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.080]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.520]   Take that two-minute sleep quiz
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.320]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.000]   that's customized for your unique sleep needs.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.840]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.840]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman to get up to 25% off.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.440]   Maybe you can help me here.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.440]   I've never heard a description
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.000]   of the origin of life in the universe
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.860]   that made a lot more sense to me.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.440]   Past, there were a bunch of big explosions,
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.880]   a bunch of the elements and stuff that you needed
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.540]   came together, and then at some point there was water,
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.960]   and at some point there were critters that moved,
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.360]   and then multicellular organisms.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.120]   Like, what am I missing here?
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.160]   I mean, I'm a man of science and I love science,
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.280]   but why can't, I can grasp it when it's told to me,
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.000]   but why is it that it's so hard?
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.880]   Maybe I'm just not smart enough to comprehend this idea
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   that a star exploded, dot, dot, dot, and here we are.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.320]   - I think it's obvious
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.360]   why you have this particular affliction,
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.880]   and that's because you're used to doing experiment.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.720]   You're a scientist.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.880]   Your core identity, one of your core identities
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.800]   is a scientist, right?
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.340]   And you think of things scientifically.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.160]   And as I said before, the scientific method,
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.320]   as we practice it, is based on hypothesis,
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.560]   observation, experimentation, iteration, right?
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.040]   Well, think about this.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.080]   If I study, if I have a hypothesis
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   that certain people can detect sunspots, right?
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.800]   So I want to have a control group,
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.680]   and I want to have a variable, right?
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.080]   So I want to be able to contrast
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.160]   and see if it's statistically significant, right?
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.560]   And I don't want to p-hack, right?
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.360]   So what do I have to do then?
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.880]   Well, I have to control the number of sunspots.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.440]   Okay, sorry, I'm not, you know,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.880]   you used to say you weren't around at the creation,
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.440]   you know, at the design meeting for human beings.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.480]   - I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.560]   - By the way, when Brian says p-hacking,
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.120]   p-hacking is people tinkering with the numbers
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.040]   or the experiment or the hypothesis
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.200]   after the data are in,
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.380]   in order to try and establish statistical significance,
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.680]   which, and by the way, p-hacking is not just, not good.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.520]   It's bad.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.540]   It's cheating of a whole, it's not making up data,
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.440]   but it's tweaking the experimental design
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.560]   in hopes that you'll get something where you probably didn't.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.400]   It's not good.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.560]   You don't want to do it, don't do it.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.220]   - Your colleague at Stanford, Uido Mbenz,
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.560]   won the Nobel prize in economics in 2021.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   And he's done a tremendous amount of work in this,
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.640]   and, you know, confounding variables, p-hacking.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.840]   Where do these things manifest themselves in physics?
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.200]   Well, high temperature superconductors.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.240]   This goes back to the late 80s.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.080]   I remember graduating from high school.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.560]   There was a discovery of room temperature,
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.120]   what's called cold fusion.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.720]   That was one thing that would create also limitless energy,
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.280]   too cheap to meter from just using hydrogen
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.440]   and from seawater and palladium and platinum.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.720]   That turned out to be bogus.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.160]   And it turned out to be the data were manipulated
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.240]   in such a way that we would say,
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.980]   probably fall into the realm of p-hacking,
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.440]   which may not have been maliciously intended,
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.240]   but the goal, the output of it is certainly,
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.620]   you know, a driving incentive that influences people
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.000]   to do things that are unethical.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.840]   And that happens at all levels.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.720]   And we saw it, I saw it in my own experiment,
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.680]   not necessarily accusing my colleagues of being unethical.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.200]   We were searching and we still are searching
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.740]   for what caused the big bang.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.760]   We're gonna get back to your question of how this comes.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.600]   'Cause I think I can help.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.480]   - But that plate's still spinning in the background.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.320]   - Yeah, it's still spinning. - Like a planet.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:18.280]   - It's spinning like our solar system, right?
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.640]   But the quarry was so big.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.680]   To unravel what caused the big bang to bang?
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.800]   What ignited the spark that became our universe?
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.840]   It's at least, it was called when we announced
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:34.840]   the discovery at Harvard on St. Patrick's Day, 2014.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.600]   World News covered front page everywhere, New York Times,
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.480]   CNN, every single outlet covered it.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.820]   It was called one of the greatest discoveries of all time.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.380]   Not only did it explain how our universe
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.180]   came into existence, it also predicted the existence
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:51.380]   of other universes in what's called the multiverse,
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.700]   which we've heard about maybe in quantum computing.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.260]   - Most people have heard of it on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.980]   - Yeah, exactly right, that's right.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.500]   Among many things that we hear about only on that show.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:03.580]   So the point is, it was a quarry for the ages.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.980]   And I knew that because that's why
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.500]   I invented the experiment, right?
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.260]   I told you, my father and I, you know,
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.860]   we never really had the rapprochement
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:12.660]   that you and your father seem to have had, and that's great.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.540]   We always had kind of a difficult relationship.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.360]   As I said, he abandoned me and my book,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.020]   I write about this rather.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.540]   He abandoned me and my older brother, Kevin,
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.740]   at, I was seven, he was 10, and he just left us.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.140]   And because of that, he didn't end up, you know,
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.260]   paying child support for me or my brother
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.780]   and alimony to my mother.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.620]   And so my stepfather adopted us,
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.620]   and my last name was originally not Keating,
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.500]   it was Axe, A-X.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500]   And so when we were adopted, I never saw him.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.520]   I didn't see him for 15 years.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.020]   But I knew one thing, he was a brilliant scientist,
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.980]   and he was actually the youngest,
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.780]   he was not only a tenured professor,
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   he was full professor with like a chair
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.060]   at Cornell at age 26.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.660]   So you and I got our professorship like our 30s or whatever.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.020]   - I was 40 when I got tenure.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.940]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like a much,
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.660]   he was 26, 27, I was in math, it was a little different.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:59.820]   But I knew he won, basically,
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.460]   there's no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:02.300]   There's the Fields Medal,
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.340]   which is kind of equivalent at some level,
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.860]   but almost nobody knows about it.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.420]   It's only given every five years.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.620]   You have to be under 40, whatever.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.260]   He never won that, but he won like the prize
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.500]   just beneath that, if you will, called the Cole Prize.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.180]   And remarkable scientist,
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:18.420]   got into incredible discoveries in mathematics and physics.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.260]   And I knew one thing, he never won the Nobel Prize.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.580]   So as some kids might compete with their father,
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.620]   who's a captain of the high school football team,
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.620]   and they wanna be the captain of the college,
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:29.180]   very competitive, boys can be competitive
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:30.020]   with their dads, right?
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:30.840]   You know that.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.660]   And I wanted to compete with him,
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.460]   but he wasn't an athlete, I wasn't an athlete.
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.000]   I can compete with him and do what he could not do,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.380]   which was win a Nobel Prize.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.380]   And I was estranged from him.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.340]   And I was like, I'm gonna win a Nobel Prize
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.580]   and I'll show him, you know,
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.680]   and he'll regret that he abandoned me
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.700]   and gave me up for adoption.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:46.940]   This is my thought process.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:49.220]   I'm not saying it's like the most elevated way to be,
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.380]   but that's the way I thought of it.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.340]   So I said, I have to invent something, discover something
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:54.540]   that's worthy of a Nobel Prize.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.060]   That's all I have to do, quote unquote.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:56.880]   How hard can it be?
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.060]   There's been hundreds of Nobel Prizes given out.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:28:59.900]   These people-- - That's the way
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.140]   you thought about it? - I was at Stanford
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.180]   and you're surrounded by Nobel, you know what it's like.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.860]   I was a postdoc at Stanford for a short time.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.780]   We can get into that.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.300]   And the point was I was obsessed with discovering
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.700]   or inventing an experiment that could take us back
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.300]   to the primordial universe before what we call the Big Bang.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.620]   The Big Bang is not the origin of time and space.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.460]   It's the origin of the first elements
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.520]   in the periodic table of the elements.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.340]   We still don't know what caused that event to occur.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.120]   And I realized that if we discovered
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.180]   what caused that event to occur,
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.760]   which is hypothesized to be a phenomenon called inflation,
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.920]   which was co-created by at least three scientists,
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.460]   but two of whom were at Stanford,
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.220]   associate with Stanford, Alan Guth, who's now at MIT.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.180]   He was a postdoc at Slack, and Andre Linde,
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:49.220]   who's a renowned professor at Stanford to this day.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:52.180]   So they predicted that there was this mysterious substance
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:55.140]   called a quantum field, and that the fluctuations
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.820]   in this quantum field existing
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:00.540]   in the four-dimensional infinite space,
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.660]   the random fluctuations of a quantum field,
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.160]   what's called vacuum energy, is unstable.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.620]   You can't have what's called vacuum or negative energy
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.180]   and have it just sit there permanently.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.140]   It eventually inexorably must fluctuate,
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.900]   and the fluctuations can actually spawn
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.620]   an expansion of that four-dimensional space locally.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.100]   And that occurred at a specific time.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.380]   - When you say four-dimensional space,
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.020]   can you tell us the axes of that space?
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:23.860]   - So you can think of it
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.860]   as just ordinary three-dimensional space,
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.420]   but imagine X, Y, and Z extend to infinity
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:29.780]   in all directions.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:32.060]   And we're sitting at our local,
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.420]   what we perceive as the center of our universe.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.100]   It's just our observable universe.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:40.100]   We can look out 90 billion light years in any direction,
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.920]   which is longer than the age of the universe
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.900]   times the speed of light.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.500]   That's because the universe has been expanding.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.480]   In addition to having existed for 14 billion years,
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.420]   it's been expanding for an additional power
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.420]   of three times that.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.360]   And then imagine time.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.860]   So time is a fourth component,
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.300]   and we have to weave those together
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.460]   in order to understand how objects behave
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.860]   in this landscape of what we call the cosmos.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.660]   But it wasn't limited to just our,
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.460]   what we now see as our universe.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.300]   We have a horizon,
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.040]   just like if you go off to the Pacific Ocean here
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.860]   away from land, you see a horizon.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.380]   It's a circular horizon in all directions.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.660]   So we live on a three-dimensional planet, right?
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.980]   The horizon is two-dimensional.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.320]   It's one-dimensional, circle,
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.460]   that we can see any ship that's above the horizon,
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:26.200]   we can see visible light coming from it, right?
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.700]   But we can perceive that there are things
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.980]   on the other side of the planet that we can't see,
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.380]   and we have to learn about those through indirect methods.
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.280]   We can talk about that a different time.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.660]   So there's a horizon on a three-dimensional surface,
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:38.920]   that's a one-dimensional surface.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:41.900]   In four dimensions, it's a two-dimensional surface.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.860]   So you kind of lose two dimensions.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.540]   And that means it's a sphere.
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.220]   It looks like, our universe looks like a sphere
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.340]   centered on us.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.660]   We look in all directions, we see constellations,
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:53.100]   we see galaxies, we see clusters of galaxies.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.900]   If you go far enough back, you see this primordial heat
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.500]   that's left over from the formation of the elements.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.780]   That's called the cosmic microwave background radiation.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:02.880]   That's what I study.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.020]   It's properties.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.620]   And what it reveals is the oldest light in the universe,
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.900]   the oldest possible light.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.860]   It was once visible, you could see it if you existed,
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.900]   but nobody existed back then.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.380]   And it originates from the formation of the lightest
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.300]   elements and the lightest atoms on the periodic table.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.700]   So you could look back, and if you could see this,
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.760]   you would see a pattern imprinted on that light
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.940]   called gravitational radiation, or waves of gravity.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.380]   And that would be evidence of something
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.940]   beyond the visible horizon.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.180]   And that would actually originate
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:35.080]   from this inflationary epoch, if it occurred.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.940]   So I had the idea to build the first telescope,
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.740]   a refracting telescope of all things,
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.480]   just a little telescope with lenses,
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.500]   but lenses that are transparent to microwaves
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.860]   and focus microwaves.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.680]   But I realized I could build that telescope,
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.220]   and if we were successful, I didn't think
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.460]   we wasn't guaranteed to be successful,
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.820]   but it was a big enough scientific quest
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.700]   that it was guaranteed to win a Nobel Prize
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:56.520]   if we were correct.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.700]   In fact, you know, spoiler alert,
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.460]   my first book is called "Losing the Nobel Prize"
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.220]   because we had to retract the discovery
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:05.900]   that we made at Harvard on St. Patrick's Day, 2014,
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.780]   10 years ago.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:10.180]   - So you had a paper that essentially led you
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.420]   to the realistic possibility
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.860]   that you might win the Nobel Prize.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.700]   - Yeah.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:17.000]   - And then you had to retract it.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.880]   Do you recall your emotional state or state of mind
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.180]   when you realized that you were wrong?
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.020]   - Very clear.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.420]   And that's how it relates to this p-hacking
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.100]   and everything else.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.440]   We actually didn't have this paper peer-reviewed.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.280]   We were so concerned that a competitor,
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.960]   which is a spacecraft, a billion-dollar spacecraft,
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.200]   we were just a $10 million experiment,
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.320]   a little telescope at the South Pole, Antarctica,
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.000]   where I've been a couple times,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.520]   and that instrument bested a scientific telescope
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:46.320]   led by 1,000 people, costing a billion dollars,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.420]   led out of multiple countries in America and Europe.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.080]   And we were terrified, as many scientists are,
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.000]   that we're gonna get scooped.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.400]   In fact, the original discovery
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.560]   of the cosmic microwave background was made by accident.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.120]   The discovery of this three-Kelvin heat source
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.560]   that's coming to us in all directions,
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.880]   i.e. it's a background,
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.500]   was made by accident at Bell Laboratories,
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.880]   and Bell Labs accidentally discovered it
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.200]   because they were looking
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.000]   at the very first communication satellites.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.760]   You know, AT&T, Bell Labs of communications.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.640]   - So they stumbled on it.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.920]   - They accidentally said, "I'm looking at the satellite
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:19.440]   "that should have a certain amount of background hiss,
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.060]   "noise, whatever that was expected,
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.440]   "but I'm getting hundreds of times that amount.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.860]   "And where could that be coming from?"
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.340]   They did very excruciating, very high-precision measurements
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.260]   and they found they couldn't identify
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.340]   a single terrestrial source or a cosmic source
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.460]   of any other sort except for the fact
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:37.820]   that if the universe began essentially with a Big Bang,
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.440]   they didn't call it that back then,
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.500]   that there would be a pervasive heat left over
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.020]   that would be exactly this temperature,
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:46.460]   three degrees above absolute zero, three degrees Kelvin.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.100]   So I knew if they won a Nobel Prize,
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.340]   certainly I'd win a Nobel Prize
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:51.300]   for discovering why that effect happened, right?
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.200]   It's like you discover, you know, some amino acid
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.180]   and then you discover, well, it's produced by DNA.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.260]   Well, certainly, you know, if the amino acid
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.780]   won the Nobel Prize, certainly DNA would win
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:01.620]   the Nobel Prize, right?
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.660]   - Well, Hans Kornberg, Arthur Kornberg,
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:07.860]   RNA, Sun, you know, structure of RNA.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.300]   So you published a paper that wasn't peer-reviewed
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.820]   because you were worried about getting scooped.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:14.220]   But scooped is when someone else beats you
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.940]   to publication, folks, and gets credit for the discovery.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.500]   It's a whole discussion that we could have some other time
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.660]   if we just wanna riff on the process of science.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.060]   But so you published the paper.
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:26.900]   - We didn't publish it.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.780]   We submitted it to the archive.
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:30.260]   We had a press conference
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:33.580]   at Harvard Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences,
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.180]   and it was televised.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.180]   And in the audience were Nobel laureates and reporters,
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:39.980]   but the discovery that, you know,
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.700]   it was clear that we would have won it.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.020]   However, at that time, I had been removed
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.500]   from the leadership of the experiment that I created.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.460]   So I created the predecessor experiment.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.300]   You know, it's like iPhones.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.540]   You build one, then you upgrade it,
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.980]   you build a better camera, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.140]   So the first one I invented
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.860]   when I was a postdoc at Stanford, it was called BICEP,
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.420]   and it stood for Background Imager
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.660]   of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.380]   And it's also kind of a play on words
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.620]   because the pattern of microwave polarization,
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:10.140]   which we can talk about, was a twisting, curling pattern.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.380]   So I made the pun, like curl like you do bicep,
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.860]   the muscle behind curls.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.020]   Anyway, it's not that funny.
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.660]   And they ended up trying to change the acronym,
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.820]   which pissed me off.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:22.380]   But anyway, the tragic thing
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:24.460]   is that we built this experiment,
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.900]   we upgraded this experiment.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.340]   It was very hard to get money to build it.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.900]   I got money from David Baltimore,
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.420]   who's the president of Caltech.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.140]   I should say, I was at Stanford.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.460]   - I should say about David Baltimore,
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:36.980]   just 'cause people might wanna go to,
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.860]   former president of Caltech, maybe still?
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.900]   - Rockefeller, no, he's not.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.180]   - Former president of the Rockefeller,
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:43.340]   that's an interesting story.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:46.260]   If you wanna look it up, look it up, as they say.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.820]   Scientists are human.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:50.460]   He landed at Caltech.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.820]   So they funded you to do this?
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:54.580]   - He gave me a special grant,
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:56.980]   just a presidential, it was called Caltech President's Fund.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:59.700]   He gave it to me and my postdoc advisor, Andrew Lang,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.100]   who's an incredible scientist.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.140]   He was married to Frances Arnold,
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.660]   who won the Nobel Prize in 2018 in chemistry,
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.660]   renowned scientist as well.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.020]   And they were just a power couple.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:13.320]   And he invited me to give a talk and I gave a job talk.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.340]   He hired me on the spot.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.540]   I couldn't help myself from saying yes
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.380]   before he finished this.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:18.580]   I was miserable at Stanford, by the way.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.620]   It was 1999, 2000, dot-com boom.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:24.820]   I was making $32,000 a year, living on Alma Street.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.820]   The Caltrains were running every 17 minutes.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.180]   I know because I was awake from 5 a.m.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.540]   I couldn't sleep more than four or five hours.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.180]   And I just said yes, moved down to Caltech.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:36.440]   And because of that, I convinced him
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.140]   and my colleague, Jamie Bach, who's currently a professor,
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.500]   to build this telescope
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.960]   and put it at the South Pole in Antarctica.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.580]   And that was the only place we could do it.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:47.060]   And the only university that would fund it
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.300]   was this gift from David Baltimore's presidential fund.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.780]   So these confluence of events.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.860]   And by the way, then, because I got this job
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.060]   and because I built this telescope with my colleagues,
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.140]   I got the job at UCSD,
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:58.660]   which then enabled me to meet my wife.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.620]   - So let me, incredible story.
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:04.180]   You moved down to Caltech, which is in Pasadena.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.380]   Amazing place.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.900]   And then you get the money.
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:07.740]   How much was this telescope?
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.140]   - The initial one was a million dollars
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.100]   to build the first version.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.160]   - That's quite a gift for a postdoc, a million bucks.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.320]   You decide the South Pole will be the place to do it.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.920]   We can talk about why that is.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.040]   And then you make this discovery,
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.360]   which turns out to be false.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.660]   But it sounds like you have good feelings
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.420]   about the experience nonetheless.
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.960]   - So because I was recognized
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.560]   and this experiment got a lot of attention
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.240]   because it was really the first one ever designed
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.080]   to look for the spark that ignited the whole Big Bang.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.680]   So it became just the cause celebra
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.380]   of the cosmology field.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:41.860]   - And are you thinking at this point,
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.520]   forgive me for playing therapist here,
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.380]   I'm not one, I'm not pretending to.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.220]   - No, it's fine.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.340]   - Were you thinking at this point,
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.500]   okay, this challenge that I think not all,
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.740]   but a lot of sons have with their fathers,
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.060]   not necessarily to best them,
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:57.980]   but one evaluates themselves relative
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.940]   to like their family lineage.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.780]   Sometimes it's a grandfather.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:05.140]   This thing of having some internal friction
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.100]   in order to live up to something.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.220]   Sounds like that was driving you.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.480]   Look at Tiger Woods, another Stanford guy.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.080]   Same story, but father, hard pushing, driving.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.880]   And then what does he do after he is a PGA champion?
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.240]   He wants to like become a Navy SEAL or something.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.080]   - He was hanging out with a lot of SEAL team members.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.040]   - It wasn't enough for him.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.440]   So sorry, I interrupted your question.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.240]   - So at the point where you made this discovery,
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.740]   were you feeling like, all right, check that box.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:31.360]   - What was kind of revelatory to me
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.440]   is that sometimes you start a quest
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.880]   or you start a journey and the fuel that gets you going,
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.000]   it's no longer serves you when you get there.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.240]   My brother always says baggage has handles
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.280]   so you can put it down.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.120]   - Nice.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.000]   - So that like journey from initiating it,
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.980]   the experiment to best my dad, to show him up,
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:54.000]   to make him regret that he abandoned me and my brother.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.600]   I mean, I always said, I could see how he could abandon me.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.440]   I was only seven, I'm kind of boring.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.880]   He used to joke, I only care about kids
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.440]   once they learn calculus.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.840]   He was a funny--
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.240]   - What a cruel thing to say.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.720]   - He would say it in jest and it is true.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.080]   We did reunite and we did have a reproach moment
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.640]   but it was after inventing this experiment,
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.240]   after I arrived at Caltech, it was.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.840]   I mean, he was this kind of intellect
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.980]   and it was so lovely to see you and your dad.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.440]   My wish for you is to have kind of an experience,
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:24.480]   maybe similar, maybe not, but when you do have kids,
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.760]   and please God, you will, you get a do-over.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.400]   You get to kind of correct the mistakes
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.040]   or the ways that you, and you'll never get it right.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.060]   One of my friends is a psychiatrist.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.400]   He says, your job as a parent is to only pass on
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.520]   half of your neuroticism to your kids.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.780]   If every generation does that,
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.760]   you'll eventually be a perfect species.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.760]   But I felt that passion and so forth to kind of best him.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.840]   And then when we reunited and it no longer,
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.500]   as I said, it no longer served me.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.100]   But the trajectory that I had launched this experiment on
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.560]   continued unabated.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.080]   And so that had this inertia, this momentum
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:03.920]   that couldn't be stopped.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.300]   In fact, so many people wanted a part of it
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.200]   and so much pressure was surrounding it
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.920]   that I think partially that led to me
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.960]   actually being kind of kicked out
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.920]   of the leadership of the experiment.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.760]   And that was precipitated by a truly tragic event.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.280]   So I told you my advisor, Sarah Church,
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.960]   set up a job interview for me with her advisor
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.360]   when she was a postdoc at Caltech named Andrew Lang.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.480]   Andrew was like, at that time I was estranged from my dad.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.920]   He was like a father figure.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.560]   He was like, you ever see the TV show "Mad Men"
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.880]   like Don Draper, he's just like handsome, good looking.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.680]   Everyone thought he was gonna win a Nobel Prize.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.920]   He was stolen from Berkeley.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.400]   They spent tons of money to recruit him from Berkeley
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.480]   to come to Caltech.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:50.680]   His wife was a power couple, Frances Arnold.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.220]   Again, she won the Nobel Prize a few years ago.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.820]   And he just had the world at his fingertips,
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.300]   charming, funny.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.560]   And he would say things like,
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.120]   "Brian, this is so unrealistic that we have to do it."
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.480]   Like he was a kid, he loved to play and he loved,
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.000]   he's the one who inspired me in this way
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.720]   of just never stopping.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.760]   Like that passionate curiosity
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.200]   and the reward that you get.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.640]   I always say, you know, when you solve a problem,
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.360]   your reward is a harder problem.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.240]   Like that's, but that, if you're a scientist,
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.200]   that feels good.
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.960]   'Cause it's like, I always say,
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.160]   and I think it's one of your colleagues,
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.680]   I'm not sure, so much good stuff going on up there,
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.000]   but there's this concept of finite games
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.360]   and infinite games, right?
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.880]   So I always say, science is an infinite game.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.400]   You can't win science.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.720]   It goes on forever.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.280]   No one masters all of whatever science is.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.600]   You can debate even what it is,
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.920]   but it's composed of an infinite number of finite games.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.040]   Getting into college, getting into graduate school,
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.440]   getting a postdoc, getting a tenure track position.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.960]   Those are all finite games, right?
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.280]   And the ultimate, what's the ultimate finite game?
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.360]   A Nobel Prize.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.320]   'Cause only three people can win it each year.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.440]   There's only 200 people have ever won it.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.080]   You know, there's more people in the NBA
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.760]   than have won it in physics, right?
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.800]   So this is a very exclusive club,
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.080]   and if, you know, if you win it,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.880]   somebody else isn't gonna win it, right?
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.920]   Odds are.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.200]   And this pressure to kind of get to that level
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.040]   should never exceed the passion
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.680]   that drove you to become a scientist in the first place.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.880]   And so I was obsessed with that.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.520]   And what Andrew Lang showed me
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.400]   is that science is its own reward.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.600]   And the pleasure of finding things out,
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.360]   as, you know, Feynman would say, is its reward.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.600]   Science is its own reward,
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600]   and that's characteristic of these infinite games.
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.040]   You just wanna keep playing them.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.120]   And the tragic thing is that,
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.200]   and I'm emotional thinking about this,
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.240]   when Andrew was at the peak of his life,
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.800]   he chose to take it.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.800]   He took his own life.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:44.720]   - He killed himself.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.880]   - He killed himself.
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.280]   Ironically, tragically, he used helium,
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.000]   which is, you know, central to the formation of the universe
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.560]   and the creation of our universe
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.640]   is reliant in large part on helium, the abundance of,
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.920]   and he asphyxiated himself in a cheap, dirty, sleazy motel.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.720]   Actually, I had stayed at in Pasadena
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.400]   when I was visiting him for my initial job talk.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.800]   - Do you mind if we go into this a bit?
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.760]   I realize it's a painful memory, and I feel it.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.600]   Not to shift the focus, but ironically,
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.360]   all three of my academic advisors dead.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.400]   First one shot himself in a bathtub
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.880]   two weeks after we celebrated something for him.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.120]   Just like, you know, suicide is such a peculiar thing.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.360]   He did it for very different reasons,
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.360]   different stage of life.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.060]   Let's get back to Lange.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.000]   How old was he?
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.320]   - He was 41, I think.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.840]   - So he's young.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.920]   - Had three kids, three sons.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.840]   - Wife still alive?
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.080]   - Yeah, Frances still, you know, a renowned professor.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.740]   - Was she shocked?
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:44.680]   - They were separated.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.040]   They had gotten estranged,
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:49.080]   and they weren't living together.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.400]   It was interesting.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.520]   He was always very close.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.700]   She had two children, I think, from a previous marriage,
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.520]   or one child from a previous marriage,
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:58.520]   and he was like a father to that son as well,
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.800]   like a biological father, whatever that means.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.320]   Kids were so dedicated to him.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.800]   And look, don't cry for me.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.640]   I mean, it's still emotional,
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.440]   'cause he meant so much to me as a mentor,
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.400]   as a friend, as an advisor, as a father figure, basically,
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.400]   but he had real kids, and he had adopted kids.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.160]   - It was tragic for everyone.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.240]   Suicide is such a peculiar thing
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.480]   because it, in some sense, it can, quote-unquote,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.240]   make sense for, if somebody we know is very depressed,
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.400]   or they have a terminal illness, you know,
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.600]   and, but it sounds like it came as a bit of a surprise.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.520]   Do you think that sometimes there's this close relationship
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:43.520]   between genius and, let's just say, not mentally healthy,
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.180]   that, you know, even what you mentioned before,
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.960]   you know, like we have to try this experiment.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.800]   I mean, there's a bit of a recklessness to that
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.920]   when you're dealing with millions and millions of dollars
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.800]   in postdoc careers, and, you know, there's a,
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.920]   I mean, the delight of a fun experiment
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.260]   and an adventurous experiment,
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.160]   maybe as a project where you kind of wade into it
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.000]   a little bit to see,
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.160]   but that's very different than, like, we have to do this.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.060]   I mean, there's a risk-taking element there
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.640]   that supersedes kind of my notions
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.920]   of what an advisor's job is,
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.600]   which is to make sure that people progress
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.040]   toward, sure, discovery,
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.540]   but also, like, you want some,
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.280]   one of the most important thing to mentoring scientists
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.040]   is that they have some sense that there is a future for them
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.060]   and you can't guarantee it,
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.320]   but you'd like to, like a parent would for a child.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.800]   You want to give them some sense
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.200]   that, like, the sun's gonna come up tomorrow.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.040]   - That's right.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.160]   - Like, we're not gonna implode or explode here.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.880]   - And he was a pragmatist.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.040]   He would give me advice, life advice, you know,
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.640]   and again, I was estranged from my father.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.040]   He was playing this role,
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.640]   and he was just so, he was charming,
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.960]   and he was handsome, charismatic.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.560]   He had just discovered, you know,
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:51.200]   came off this discovery of proving that the universe
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.200]   has a flat spatial geometry,
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.320]   which just means that any triangle
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.200]   that you make in the universe,
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:00.080]   whether it's three planets, three stars, three galaxies,
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.360]   three patches of the cosmic microwave background radiation,
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.700]   always the interior angles add up to 180 degrees,
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.560]   as they do on a flat table here,
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.940]   as they did for Euclid,
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.680]   and that had astonishing implications
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.040]   for how the universe might've begun.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.000]   - And it's still true.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.080]   - And this is still true.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.040]   It's more true than ever.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.340]   - So do you think that perhaps, I mean, who knows,
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:23.640]   perhaps he committed suicide because he was at a peak?
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.780]   You know, one of the things that people talk about
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:28.480]   is the peak and trough of dopamine.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.780]   You mentioned infinite games.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.920]   You know, I've said many times before
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.000]   that it's very important
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000]   that you not get fast, large amplitude increases in dopamine
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.160]   that are not preceded by effort.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.160]   You know, methamphetamine will give you a large amplitude,
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.520]   you know, a fast increase in dopamine,
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.000]   but there's zero effort involved except to procure it,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   and it sinks you into a post-dopaminergic peak,
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.880]   trough afterwards,
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.880]   that will have you hanging on for the will to live.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.160]   So what comes up goes down,
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.900]   and it often goes down further than it went up
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:04.920]   when we're talking about dopamine.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.120]   Playing an infinite game is great
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:10.200]   because it's in the motivation for answers.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.660]   - It sounds like he like hit a peak,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.000]   and you wonder if maybe he was like,
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.160]   "Okay, now I'm gonna check out now.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.960]   "It's gonna be hard to keep doing this."
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.040]   - I don't think it's explicable.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.560]   I don't think, I mean,
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.400]   the human brain is the most complicated thing,
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.960]   and you know, the human brains can even contemplate, right?
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.760]   It's the solipsistic in a sense,
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.600]   but I couldn't really wade into it.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.280]   I mean, I know details of his personal life,
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.000]   and yes, divorce and separation and so forth,
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.340]   but I don't think that's it,
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.320]   just because the highs of the new quest
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.840]   and like the dopamine hadn't really come in from Bicep,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.760]   and it wouldn't come in for four more years
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.160]   after his death in 2010.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.440]   - So you got to continue the project.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.520]   - We got to continue the project,
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.960]   but because he was removed,
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.960]   and he was kind of my, you know, consigliere,
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.520]   or you know, whatever, I was to him.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.140]   I forget how the relationship goes.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:58.360]   I'm not as conversant with the mafia as I should be,
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.320]   but with Andrew, with his death,
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.200]   one of the, you know, trivial in comparison consequences
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:08.140]   was that the main patron and backer of me in my career,
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:10.420]   who had, you know, helped me get my job at UCSD,
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.620]   had helped me get, you know,
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.500]   this presidential career grant,
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.140]   which I received from President Bush,
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.060]   and all these incredible accomplishments,
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.100]   and just been my sounding board on experiments,
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.940]   and kept me going and helped me
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.300]   when I had troubles with my graduate students,
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:26.220]   and he would talk to my, I mean, it's unheard of, right?
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.900]   The compassion that this man had,
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.700]   and if he had only reached out to me, you know,
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.980]   I'm sure he had better friends than me,
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.040]   but like, I would have gotten up in a second, you know?
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.560]   I went to the motel where he took his life
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.800]   when I was writing my book just to put me back in,
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.760]   like, try, how could I comprehend it?
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.040]   I couldn't, I just cried.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.520]   I sat in front of the hotel and I cried,
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.920]   but no, I don't think we can understand it,
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.400]   but the eventual high wouldn't come,
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.340]   and then a much more crashing low
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:53.160]   after we essentially had to retract it,
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.280]   and we're disconfirmed, as they say.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.240]   - So you continued with the project?
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:59.880]   - Yeah, I was at UCSD, and I'd left Caltech.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.640]   - You get your job, you got this telescope
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.220]   down at the South Pole.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.380]   How do you get to the South Pole?
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:07.060]   You fly to Chile, and then you ride a bicycle down?
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.860]   - It's like, you know, I never had the physique
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:11.900]   to get into the military, although I wanted to at one point
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.880]   to be a pilot, actually.
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.580]   I wanted to go to the Air Force Academy
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:17.900]   like my stepfather did, but I didn't have the physique.
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.300]   I didn't have the HLP diet back then,
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.460]   but the point was you go on a military, it's a whole way,
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:27.300]   and you do it in seven days, eight days, if you're lucky.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.420]   Sometimes it can take three weeks
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:29.300]   due to the weather down there.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:32.780]   It's the most violent weather, most winds, turbulence,
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.220]   everything, you know, hostile, but it's a cakewalk
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:37.800]   compared to the Explorer, Shackleton,
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:40.500]   or Scott, and of course, Amundsen.
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.320]   So the quest to get to the South Pole first,
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.480]   which is South Pole, I should say,
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.880]   for people that aren't familiar,
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.400]   Antarctica's the seventh continent,
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.860]   so the last one to be discovered.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:51.480]   It was only really discovered, it was thought to be there
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.240]   because it was thought that to balance the continents
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.080]   in the northern hemisphere,
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.240]   you needed a massive counterweight in the southern.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.300]   It's so stupid, but anyway, it wasn't discovered
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:02.460]   until 1900s, really, that they truly existed,
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:05.140]   and then it wasn't explored until 10 or 12 years later,
[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:06.780]   and the quest to get to the South Pole,
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:08.940]   it was the last unexplored, you know,
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.540]   non-Fildon part of the map of the Earth,
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.340]   so the quest to get there was like going to the moon,
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:16.180]   and in fact, it exactly parallels the moon
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.220]   in that once it was reached for the first time,
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.740]   nobody cared to go back again, you know,
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.580]   for many, many years,
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.060]   and we're only going back to the moon now,
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.980]   60 years later, 50 years later,
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:27.620]   after the Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 missions, right?
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.500]   So getting there and setting that bar, right,
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.440]   and making that accomplishment,
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.180]   sometimes that's the extent of it,
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.500]   like when you have the dopamine hit
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.380]   of being the first to get somewhere.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:40.780]   Scott was a British scientist and explorer,
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.700]   and Amundsen was just an explorer.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.780]   Amundsen, Roald Amundsen,
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.340]   he tried to get to the North Pole first, he lost.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:48.140]   Somebody else beat him, and he said,
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:49.900]   "Well, I'm gonna keep going with this skis
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.580]   "and sled dog team that I have,"
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:54.780]   and he literally went to the South Pole, 180 degrees around.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.820]   So the poles are the two end points
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.220]   of the Earth's axis of rotation.
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:00.540]   There's a North Pole, there's no land there,
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:02.420]   there's no continent there, there's ice there,
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:04.980]   and Santa is there, exactly, right?
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.500]   And then the South Pole's a continent.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.260]   If you go, I brought a piece of it here that I collected,
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:10.740]   probably illegally from Antarctica,
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.540]   I'll show it to you later.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.460]   It's just rocks, right?
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.140]   So if you drill under the ice in Antarctica,
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.260]   you come to a continent,
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:18.820]   and that's the difference between the North and South Poles.
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:21.180]   But the South Pole is 700 nautical miles
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.340]   from the coast of Antarctica.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:24.940]   The closest point of approach in the 1900s
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.140]   was you take a ship from New Zealand,
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.260]   you sail due South, there's no other way to go,
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.020]   and you come to the continental shelf,
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.060]   the coastline's called McMurdo Station,
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:34.180]   which was just, you know,
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.100]   basically there's some sea lions there and that's it,
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.180]   and orcas and penguins and nothing else at that time.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.380]   Now there's a whole research station.
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:45.340]   And then they got on skis and skied up 9,000 feet
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.100]   from sea level to 9,000 feet
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.020]   where the polar plateau flattens out,
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:50.260]   and they got to the South Pole,
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:53.260]   and Amundsen got there three weeks before Scott.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.940]   And Scott was this British, you know, naturalist,
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.820]   like a Darwin, but also he was a scientist plus an explorer.
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.620]   So he wanted to collect samples,
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.700]   and he found flora and fauna, there's not much,
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:04.980]   rocks, meteorites, he actually discovered meteorites
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.500]   in Antarctica, incredible scientist.
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:11.020]   But because he was a scientist, it cost him his life.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:14.940]   Because he was carrying all this scientific equipment
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.540]   and scientific samples, and he had to ski up them,
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.740]   like he would find it, and he's like,
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.340]   "I'm not coming back the same way that you got there
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:21.780]   "'cause of the wind patterns and stuff."
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:22.740]   So he knew he'd never come back,
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:23.580]   so he couldn't leave it there.
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:26.340]   So he had to carry extra food, fuel,
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:27.940]   and men dedicated to it.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:30.500]   Oh, and by the way, the Norwegian team,
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.980]   Amundsen was Norwegian, and they used sled dogs
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:34.820]   for two reasons.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.500]   One, they conserved calories, they provided propulsion,
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.180]   and then they provided a tasty snack
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.620]   once you got to the South Pole.
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:42.540]   'Cause once you get to the South Pole,
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.460]   you can ski downhill 9,000 feet, you know,
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.980]   to sea level, basically.
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:48.660]   And so they ate, British would refuse to do that.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.420]   So they knew they couldn't eat their dogs,
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:52.220]   and they had dogs, but they wouldn't eat them.
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.780]   So they were the sled dogs.
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:55.580]   And when they got to the South Pole,
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.660]   they came within three or four kilometers,
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:59.740]   and it's totally flat, like this table.
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:00.700]   The South Pole looks like this.
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.180]   Go out in the middle of the ocean, freeze it,
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:05.420]   paint it white, and that's what it looks like.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:09.220]   It's white, 100, you know, 360 degrees around, okay?
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:11.420]   It's the most boring place on Earth, literally,
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.980]   and I've been there.
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:15.420]   He got within, so you can see things really far away.
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:17.900]   He got there, he got within three kilometers,
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.260]   and he saw something on the horizon.
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:22.140]   He's like, oh, you know, bleep, right?
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.140]   And it was a Norwegian flag.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:27.860]   Now, can you imagine Neil Armstrong steps out of,
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.980]   you know, the Eagle, and he lands on a Soviet flag?
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:32.980]   I mean, it would be like the most crushing,
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:35.340]   it was the most, I think, the most depressing moment
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:37.260]   in human history, to come so far.
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.100]   And he actually said, they said,
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:41.660]   "Great God, this is a horrible place,
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.140]   "and all the more so for having reached it
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:46.940]   "without the benefit of priority."
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:49.540]   So the king and queen, they were depending on him
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.940]   to make the first, you know, for, you know,
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:55.460]   king and country, right, seeing the Norwegian flag.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.300]   So what did he do?
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.260]   He was a good scientist, he said,
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.100]   "Maybe they made a mistake.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.300]   "Maybe they're off by 10 feet."
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.740]   I can say, no, no, they were right.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:02.540]   The Norwegians got there first.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.020]   And because he got there three weeks later,
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:06.780]   in the middle of January, by the time he turned around,
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.260]   the winds had died down, they were no longer at his back.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:11.020]   He was skiing, he had no food.
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:13.300]   He died about three weeks later,
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:15.060]   or three months later, in March.
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.100]   So his body was later recovered,
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.420]   and it was, you know, it wasn't reported back to England
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:21.220]   for another six months.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.700]   So they gave their lives for science, for discovery,
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.340]   and to come up short to be second,
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:27.860]   it must have been the most crushing defeat in history.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.020]   But it happens to be the best place
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:30.380]   to do astronomy in the world.
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.580]   - And you get there by flying to Santiago, Chile?
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:36.900]   - No, first you go to Christchurch, New Zealand.
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.260]   You go to Auckland, LAX, Auckland,
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:40.580]   Auckland to Christchurch.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:43.420]   And then the U.S. has a charter
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:45.220]   with the New Zealand Air Force,
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:47.260]   and we give them C-130 cargo planes,
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:50.660]   or we have our own C-17 cargo planes, the jet-powered ones.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.580]   Unfortunately, I got the C-130s, which is a four-prop plane.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:59.580]   And I was on a plane that had the entire winter,
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.180]   summer supply, sorry,
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:04.980]   the entire winter supply of bananas on this cargo plane,
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.500]   which is as big as room, the cargo hold,
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.660]   you know, 12 by 12 times 50 feet long.
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:12.260]   And it was filled with bananas.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:14.060]   And at first you're like, "Oh, cool, this is great."
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:15.940]   'Til you realize there's no bathroom on the plane.
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:18.560]   There's just literally a five-gallon bucket
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.100]   and a shower curtain.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:20.980]   There are no windows on it,
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.100]   'cause why do paratroopers need windows, you know?
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:26.620]   And then there's enormous crates of bananas.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:28.260]   There's 12 tons of bananas.
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.620]   I have not touched a banana in 12 years because of that.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.620]   I know I'm missing potassium or whatever.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.340]   But the point is, you land on the coast,
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:38.140]   and then if you're lucky, you take a flight the next day,
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:39.340]   and it's a ski plane.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:42.540]   It's the only plane that the U.S. does not export.
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:45.180]   In other words, we export the F-35, other,
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.860]   this is a strategic asset that we will not export.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.740]   - So it's hard to get to.
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:48.960]   - It's very difficult.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.380]   - So why South Pole?
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.220]   - Yeah.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.380]   - And does this take us into the realm of light pollution?
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:56.220]   - Yeah.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.820]   - Right, I mean, when I look up at the starry night
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.780]   here in Los Angeles,
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.540]   even though I'm tucked sort of back
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.740]   towards the Eastern Hills.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:03.860]   - Yeah.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:05.820]   - I don't live at the coast.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.860]   I can see some pretty impressive stars.
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.320]   Not as impressive as when,
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.940]   I highly recommend people get up
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:14.540]   to the Yosemite High Country in the month of August.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:16.660]   You can catch some great meteor showers.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.620]   It's an amazing place to begin with.
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:19.740]   You have the meteor showers,
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.860]   and you're transported to another place.
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.100]   - Yeah.
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.300]   - And there's a lot of light pollution from cities.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.140]   - Yeah.
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:28.140]   - And it travels very, very far.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:29.860]   So I'm guessing you're down the South Pole
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.460]   because there's less light pollution.
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.380]   - You're right, a slight deviation from that
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.660]   is it's not light that we're looking for.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.140]   We're not looking for optical light.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.380]   We're looking for heat.
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:40.780]   So it's heat pollution.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.620]   You're exactly right.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.920]   We're looking to avoid heat pollution.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.580]   So we wanna be somewhere cold.
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:47.700]   We wanna be somewhere that's far away from,
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.940]   you know, man-made sources of RF interference
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:52.840]   and microwave interference and communications, obviously.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:55.100]   But the South Pole has a couple of other properties.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:56.820]   One, the sun is below the horizon,
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.360]   and the sun is 5,500 Kelvin.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.300]   And we're looking for something
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:03.380]   that's a fraction of a Kelvin,
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:06.080]   maybe a few milli or nano Kelvin at most.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.900]   So it's billions of times that we wanna avoid.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.980]   Even the Earth itself is still 300,
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:12.220]   almost 300 Kelvin down there.
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:15.540]   Yeah, the freezing is 273.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:17.580]   So it does have that property.
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.580]   But the best part about it,
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:20.180]   it's above a lot of the Earth's atmosphere
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:22.780]   'cause it's at 9,000 feet above sea level.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:23.660]   And it's so cold.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.260]   You don't know this 'cause you're a California baby,
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.060]   but on the East Coast, when I would grow up,
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:30.240]   some days, the bane of my existence
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.520]   would be you'd listen on the radio,
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.880]   and they'd announce school closures
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.560]   due to snowfall in the winter.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.500]   And sometimes they'd say, oh, you're out of luck
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.240]   because it's too cold to snow.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.920]   Sometimes the air temperature cannot saturate
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.400]   and form precipitation.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.880]   And the South Pole is like that.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.080]   It's so cold that if you took this glass,
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:49.380]   I'm holding a glass here,
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.440]   and it was empty on the table here,
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.160]   and I extend this glass up to outer space,
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.360]   the amount of water,
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.960]   if I took all the water in the atmosphere,
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.080]   the humidity in the atmosphere above the South Pole,
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.080]   and condensed it into a liquid,
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.800]   it would be 0.3 of a millimeter.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.440]   Here in Los Angeles, it's about an inch
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:10.080]   or 25 millimeters or more.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.480]   And so you'd like to not go there.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.840]   Now, why is that important?
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.480]   Well, water absorbs microwaves,
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.800]   and that's how your microwave oven works.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:18.960]   It heats up the water molecules.
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.360]   They start to vibrate and jumble.
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:21.240]   That causes friction.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.980]   They heat up, and eventually they'll boil, right?
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:26.600]   So that's why sometimes you can overheat liquid
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.420]   in a microwave.
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.560]   You can't tell, but it's super hot,
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.280]   and actually it can be dangerous.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.960]   But in this case, we don't want a photon
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.840]   coming from the Big Bang, perhaps,
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.780]   or before the Big Bang with the spark that ignited it.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:41.400]   We don't want that to travel for 14 billion years, nearly,
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.080]   and then get absorbed in a water molecule
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.360]   above the Earth's surface.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.560]   So the best place to go is space.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.480]   But space, even with SpaceX,
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.800]   I haven't done any scientific experiments,
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:53.120]   but it's about maybe a factor of 1,000
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.000]   to a million times more expensive.
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.840]   So the same satellite that we were worried
[01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.080]   was gonna scoop us was exactly 100,
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.000]   or almost 200 times more expensive
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.440]   than our experiment at the South Pole.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:03.480]   - Yeah, I was gonna ask you about this.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.840]   A million dollars given to a postdoc.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:07.560]   - That was a first tranche of funding.
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:08.800]   We ended up getting about 10 million.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.640]   - 10 million.
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.080]   I mean, even $10 million is a lot of money by any standard,
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.480]   but probably, to my mind,
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.520]   doesn't seem like enough money
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:21.440]   to build a high-powered telescope at the South Pole,
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.240]   bring people there, have the infrastructure.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:24.880]   I mean, it's not like you're rolling this thing out
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.520]   onto the ice and just pointing at the sky.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.640]   I mean, you need-- - Oh, it's true.
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:31.040]   - I mean, I guess you could use the bucket
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:32.440]   from the plane as a bathroom,
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.720]   but you need a number of things.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.400]   So you probably need hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:40.000]   to build a facility down at the South Pole.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.080]   - But those are all funded by you and your listeners
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:44.240]   and so are the taxpayers.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:47.240]   So the National Science Foundation operates,
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.720]   those C-130s are part
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:50.360]   of the National Science Foundation's fleet.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.000]   We don't pay a dime for them.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.800]   If I wanna build a computer network system down there,
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.360]   we don't pay a dime for it.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.800]   It's actually a point of contention
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.800]   because now I'm no longer with that experiment.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.840]   I've recused myself from it for many years,
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.000]   not because of the incident
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.480]   where we were basically later disconfirmed our results.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.680]   - Right, so you let the result out.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:10.960]   You do this news conference.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:11.800]   I wanna make sure that-- - I didn't do
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:12.620]   the news conference.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:13.460]   I was not invited. - Okay, so there's
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.280]   a big press conference. - Yes.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.120]   - Big press conference. - That's right.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.560]   - It turns, and fast forward some years,
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.240]   it turns out this was not correct.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:21.080]   - Some months, yeah. - Some months.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.120]   - Only a few months. - Not correct.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.520]   Well, better to be corrected quickly
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.480]   than collect your Nobel Prize
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.620]   and have to give it back or something, right?
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.760]   I have to say, and the pursuit of prizes
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.080]   is a complicated thing.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.320]   - Yeah. - I was always discouraged
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.760]   from pursuing prizes. - Really?
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:35.600]   - All my advisors.
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:36.420]   - Oh, you're healthier than I am.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:38.340]   - Well, my graduate advisor was very pure
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.360]   in the sense that she just liked doing experiments.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.600]   I remember she was very, very smart, very smart.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.600]   - This Barbara. - Barbara Chapman.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:48.560]   I mean, and it's not just her pedigree
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.880]   that is evidence of that, but since pedigree
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:53.320]   is something most people can at least understand
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:54.480]   internally and externally.
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.520]   I mean, she went to Harvard as an undergraduate,
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.440]   then she was at UCSF and Caltech.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:01.960]   And she actually had a project
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:04.100]   sending zebrafish up into space.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:06.680]   Looking at, yeah, looking at development
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.600]   of vestibular system in the absence of gravity.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:09.440]   - Gravity, wow.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:12.260]   - And then fixing these specimens and bringing them back.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:14.760]   Also did a lot of great work back on earth.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.560]   But she wasn't somebody who was ambitious
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:17.560]   for ambition's sake.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.520]   And then my postdoc advisor was exceedingly ambitious,
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.440]   but he also discouraged prizes and the pursuit of prizes.
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.480]   - That's the right way to be.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:28.840]   - Yeah, I think that it's sort of like going into football
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.440]   to get a Superbowl ring.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.640]   These things do represent the pinnacle,
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.080]   but it's dangerous to be chasing that like singular carrot
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.200]   because you can miss the, you miss the journey.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.360]   - Look, I'm not proud of that.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:43.120]   I'm not proud that I had such a base being on,
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.160]   you know, kind of pursuit.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.520]   I think it was, as I said,
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.080]   compounded by psychological factors, you know.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:49.520]   - But did you have fun doing the work?
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.400]   - Oh, I loved it, yeah.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.840]   I mean, getting to do what I do now,
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.200]   and now it's even more exciting in a sense
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.320]   'cause the project, you know.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.480]   And by the way, it's not like we made a blunder
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.720]   and like, you know, Rob hopefully took the lens cap
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:01.560]   off the camera.
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.720]   We didn't make a blunder like that.
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:04.520]   And there've been many, many blunders
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.320]   and actually led to much worse retractions.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.040]   Our results are stronger than ever.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.200]   I should say, are the BICEP team's results.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.800]   I've left the team, as I said.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.000]   But their results are still the very best
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.920]   by almost an order of magnitude.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:19.680]   We hope with the Simons Observatory that I'm, you know,
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:22.560]   co-leading with colleagues at Princeton and Penn
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.000]   and other places that we can actually supersede them,
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.400]   but we haven't yet.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.240]   And so what we saw, I should be very clear.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.080]   We didn't make a blunder.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.440]   We didn't see like, put our thumb in front of the viewfinder.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:34.840]   You know, we didn't make something stupid.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:39.840]   We mistook a signal produced by another astrophysical source
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:45.320]   as representative of this curling pattern of microwaves
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.280]   for which BICEP was named.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.760]   That would be indicative, if confirmed,
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.320]   of the inflationary origin of the universe,
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:54.760]   which by the way, would be concomitant
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.640]   with the existence of the multiverse.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.840]   So the stakes are really high.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.000]   That means the incentives to make sure you detect that
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.400]   are really high too and not get scooped,
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.900]   as happened many, many times.
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:04.920]   My advisor was scooped.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.880]   He never won the Nobel Prize, my advisor's advisor.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.480]   He never won the Nobel Prize.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.780]   These accidentally discovered,
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:11.760]   serendipitously discovered astronomers,
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.680]   Penzias and Wilson, they did win the Nobel Prize.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.080]   So there is a pressure on scientists to get there first,
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.880]   like Falcon, Scott, Robert Scott,
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.240]   getting to the South Pole first.
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:22.680]   There is a benefit to priority.
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.880]   It's just a fact of life and science is no different.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.840]   We teach undergraduates about seven
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:29.960]   or eight different experiments.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.280]   All of them won the Nobel Prize
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:33.200]   at some point in physics history.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:34.800]   Doesn't mean they're ain't gonna win a Nobel Prize.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.640]   No, why?
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:37.040]   'Cause they didn't get there first.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.720]   So getting there first, for better or for worse,
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:42.400]   is the sign of the greatest accomplishments,
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.880]   the sine qua non of accomplishment,
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.800]   is that that does lead to Nobel Prizes.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.960]   - Now, the goal is always, I have a motto,
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.880]   which is, you know, go as fast as you carefully can.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:56.340]   But it sounds like you were wrong for the right reasons,
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.800]   meaning no one made up data.
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.840]   There was a confound that you weren't aware of.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:01.680]   You became aware of it.
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:03.160]   - Yeah, I should say what we saw.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.320]   What we mistook as the imprimatur
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.880]   of this origin spark of the universe
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.280]   was the humblest substance in the universe, namely dust.
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:14.440]   So when a star explodes, it produces,
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.440]   after its lifetime has expired,
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.160]   it fuses lighter elements into heavier elements.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:21.800]   Eventually, it gets to produce iron.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.040]   And iron is the element for which,
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.480]   once it's fused together from, I think it's silicon
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:32.480]   or two nuclei before it, it produces too little energy
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.040]   to keep the star buoyant and expanded.
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.240]   And so the star immediately starts to collapse.
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.760]   When that collapse occurs,
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:43.520]   it blasts out into the interstellar medium
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:46.000]   that surrounds it, all the byproducts,
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.040]   the silicon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and the iron.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:52.360]   And it blasts it out into the universe surrounding it.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.880]   And that happens enough times in our galaxy
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.640]   that the galaxy is actually a pretty polluted place.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.560]   It's smoggy, it's dusty, it's dirty.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:03.160]   And the dust is actually little microscopic meteorites.
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:05.680]   So on my website, briankeating.com,
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:07.760]   I give away, actually I have a special link,
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.360]   briankeating.com/huberman.
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:13.000]   I will give away actual meteorites
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.320]   that come from your ancestral homeland of Argentina.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:18.720]   And you'll see when you get them, they're highly magnetic.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.520]   They're very dense, and I give you the material,
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.400]   the composition of these meteorites and the assay.
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.800]   We do x-ray crystallography on them, it's really cool.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:30.000]   The actual composition of them is determined
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.040]   by this last event that a star does before it dies,
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.480]   which is to produce iron.
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:37.120]   So we did discover a microwave signal
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:40.760]   from the galaxy, not from the Big Bang,
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.320]   not from the cosmos,
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:45.440]   but from particular and unique to our galaxy,
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.840]   which is that when a star explodes,
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:49.200]   it produces this material, mostly made of iron,
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:51.180]   these micrometeorites that I talked about,
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:53.440]   put on my website for your listeners.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:57.300]   And these micrometeorites are also going to act
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.820]   like little compass needles.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:01.280]   They're highly magnetically susceptible.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.200]   So the Milky Way, everything in the universe
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.040]   has a magnetic field.
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:06.560]   You have a magnetic field, birds have it,
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.920]   even bacteria can have it,
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:10.600]   and our planet obviously has it,
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:12.360]   and the galaxy has it.
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.960]   What happens when you put a compass in a magnetic field?
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.200]   Those needles get aligned with the magnetic field.
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.240]   That then produces a type of polarization.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:23.580]   Now, polarization is the least familiar.
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:25.220]   Light has three characteristics.
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:27.700]   It's intensity, it's color or spectrum,
[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:28.880]   and it's polarization.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.360]   Almost nobody knows what polarization is,
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:35.480]   but it's really the essence of what makes light a wave.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.640]   If you think about an ocean wave,
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.680]   the ocean wave is going up and down, undulating up and down,
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.120]   and the undulation, the direction perpendicular
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:44.680]   to the sea surface is sort of its polarization.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.680]   Happens to be that water waves are actually polarized
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.120]   longitudinally, but forget that.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:50.280]   Or if you and I, separated by a meter and a half,
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:52.560]   two meters, we have a rope between us.
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.000]   If we oscillate that rope up and down
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.200]   at a certain frequency, the frequency will be the spectrum,
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:58.520]   the color of the light.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:01.400]   How hard we do that would be the intensity of the light,
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:02.840]   and the plane that we're oscillating,
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.040]   the jump rope or whatever,
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.200]   that's the plane of polarization.
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.420]   These little needles of cosmic dust
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:11.320]   from the exploded innards of a star
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:14.420]   that died in our galaxy many years ago,
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.760]   and many, many billions of these stars,
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:19.040]   they produce these particles of dust.
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:23.480]   So we saw that pattern instead of seeing the birth pangs
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:25.680]   of the Big Bang, the origin of the universe.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.800]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.280]   and thank one of our sponsors, Roka.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:32.280]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.640]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.440]   I've been wearing Roka readers and sunglasses for years now,
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.520]   and I love them.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.640]   They're lightweight, they have superb optics,
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.560]   and they have lots of frames to choose from.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.560]   I'm excited to share that Roka and I have teamed up
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.680]   to create a new style of red lens glasses.
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:50.160]   These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:51.640]   after the sun goes down.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:53.360]   They filter out short wavelength light
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.780]   that comes from screens and from LED lights,
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:58.240]   the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.160]   as overhead and frankly, lamp lighting nowadays.
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.520]   I want to emphasize Roka red lens glasses
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.420]   are not traditional blue blockers.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:07.560]   They're not designed to be worn during the day
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.320]   and to filter out blue light from screen light.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.080]   They're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.260]   that suppress melatonin secretion at night,
[02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:16.920]   and that can alter your sleep.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.360]   So by wearing Roka red lens glasses,
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:20.960]   they help you calm down
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:23.160]   and they improve your transition to sleep.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:26.200]   Most nights I stay up until about 10 p.m. or even midnight,
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:27.880]   and I wake up between five and 7 a.m.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:29.760]   depending on when I went to sleep.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.800]   Now I put my Roka red lens glasses on
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:33.680]   as soon as it gets dark outside,
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:36.360]   and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep,
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.120]   which makes sense based on everything we know
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:40.480]   about how filtering out short wavelength of light
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:42.760]   can allow your brain to function correctly.
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:45.360]   Roka red lens glasses also look cool, frankly.
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.360]   You can wear them out to dinner or to concerts
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.240]   or out with friends.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.980]   So it turns out it is indeed possible
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.640]   to support your biology, to be scientific about it,
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.120]   and to remain social after all.
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.840]   If you'd like to try Roka, go to roka.com.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.160]   That's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.340]   to save 20% off your first order.
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:05.500]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.560]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.520]   - So I wanna talk about what you're working on now.
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.740]   Before I do that, right, mini segue,
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:17.520]   there are a number of questions that I have,
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:20.240]   some of which I sort of know the answers to,
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:22.080]   most of which I don't know the answers to,
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.800]   but I think a lot of people either wonder about,
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:29.560]   or if they don't, they can quickly enrich
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.820]   their experience of daily life
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:34.240]   if we were to get answers on the following.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:36.520]   So I'm thinking about this, not rapid fire Q&A,
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.880]   but maybe like one to three minute answers
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.160]   about the following.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:43.920]   For instance, why does the moon look so much bigger
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.240]   when it's near the horizon as opposed to overhead?
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.840]   - Yeah, my son asked me that two days ago.
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.340]   - So that's a fun one.
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:53.000]   So let's go first with that.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.520]   Sometimes the moon is huge, sometimes the moon is small,
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:59.960]   and I'm not talking about when it's full versus a sliver.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:00.800]   Tell us why.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:03.640]   - So the moon is always a half a degree wide,
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:06.740]   same exact apparent angular diameter as the sun,
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:10.280]   which is unique among the 290 moons in our solar system.
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.880]   Only our moon has the same apparent diameter
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:16.100]   as seen from its planet as the sun does,
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:17.360]   meaning we're the only planet
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.320]   that can have a total solar eclipse,
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:20.720]   an exact total solar eclipse
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:23.000]   like we had a couple of months ago in Austin, Texas
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.320]   and elsewhere, be that as it may.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.720]   The moon doesn't change its size.
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:28.560]   - I would hope not.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:29.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:30.220]   - That would freak me out.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:34.920]   - Yeah, the moon is about 60 times the Earth's radius
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.200]   from the Earth.
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.180]   It's 250,000 miles away,
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:41.240]   which is about one and a half light seconds away.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:46.240]   And it is about the size of the continental US in diameter,
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:48.100]   so, or a little bit less.
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:51.040]   So the moon's size doesn't change,
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.800]   but when the human eye has something to compare it to,
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.960]   the brain has a reference point to compare it to.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.000]   And because it's so big,
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.640]   if there's something in front of it, a 747,
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.040]   a person, a large building even,
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.560]   when you were, if the moon is behind that object,
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.280]   because it's so far away,
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.480]   moving even the Earth's entire radius
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:13.680]   doesn't change the moon's apparent angular diameter.
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:15.520]   It's the same in Peking as it is here,
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.800]   Beijing as it is in Los Angeles, right?
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.140]   So that means a very small,
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:21.280]   a very large change in the distance in the Earth
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:23.400]   would change the building size dramatically,
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.280]   could reduce it to zero, basically.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.520]   But when you compare it to something
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:27.720]   that ends close on the horizon,
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.660]   your brain has something visually to compare it to.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.880]   When it's overhead, at Zenith or whatever,
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.620]   it doesn't have anything to compare it to,
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:34.620]   so you're just looking at it.
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.680]   But you can always measure it,
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.900]   and you can prove to yourself it's always the same size.
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:39.820]   It's about the size of your pinky fingernail
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:42.500]   held at arm's length, same size as the sun.
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:43.340]   And interestingly enough, it's the same--
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.700]   - You said one degree.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:45.540]   - It's half a degree.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:46.380]   - Half a degree. - Half a degree, yeah.
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:47.280]   - Oh, that's why you said pinky.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:49.400]   So folks, most people probably aren't familiar
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.300]   with thinking in degrees.
[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:52.420]   If you wanna understand a degree,
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:55.300]   put your right or left, doesn't matter,
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.160]   arm out in front of you.
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.160]   Raise your thumb like a thumbs up.
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:03.360]   So the width of your thumb at arm's length
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.040]   is approximately one degree.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:06.000]   That's why you say for your pinky,
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.480]   it's about half a degree. - That's right.
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.960]   - I should also say, and this is an opportunity
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.220]   to give a fun little lesson in visual acuity.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:16.240]   If I were to draw 30 black lines spaced from one another
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.600]   with just the light color of your nail in between them,
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.320]   we'd say there were 60 lines,
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.060]   black nail, black, alternating.
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:27.600]   Your acuity for 20/20 vision
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.240]   is approximately 60 cycles per degree.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.120]   - Yes.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:33.480]   - A hawk, any kind of raptor,
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.840]   is about 120 cycles per degree,
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:37.600]   which is why they can sit up on a lamppost
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.600]   and actually see the rustling of the grass below
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.420]   and probably make out some of the individual furs
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:46.720]   on the head of a rodent.
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:47.560]   - Wow.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:48.400]   - But you can't.
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:50.960]   So what do I mean by 60 cycles per degree?
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.740]   If I were to draw 40 black lines,
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.720]   so now you have 80 total of black
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.720]   and then the color of the nail black,
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:13:59.560]   then the color of the nail.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.000]   So you would see that as, believe it or not,
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.120]   as solid black.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:03.960]   - Right.
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:07.360]   - It's, you don't have, it's beyond your acuity threshold.
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:08.200]   - Right.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:10.280]   - When you say one degree, so this is important.
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.400]   So when the moon is quote unquote giant at the horizon,
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:15.460]   put out your pinky, it covers the moon.
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:16.300]   - You can eclipse the moon, right?
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.180]   - You can eclipse the moon.
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.860]   When the moon is overhead,
[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:20.340]   you can eclipse the moon with your pinky.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.420]   And most people are probably thinking,
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:22.660]   "No way, that can't be true."
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:23.780]   But it's absolutely true.
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:25.420]   - Fun fact, which is bigger,
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:28.500]   the width of a rainbow or the width of the moon?
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:33.020]   And is a rainbow wider than a half a degree?
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:34.220]   You ever seen a rainbow you can visualize?
[02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:36.600]   - I mean, in the sky, it seems as.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:37.620]   - I'm not talking about the arc,
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.380]   the band thickness from red to blue.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:40.220]   - Right.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.040]   - Or from red.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:41.880]   - Voyagee biv.
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:42.700]   - Voyagee biv, yeah.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.100]   It's bigger.
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:46.340]   - Gosh, intuitively, I wanna say it's thicker,
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:48.580]   but now you're gonna tell me that it can't be
[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:51.800]   because it's, this is like the Pink Floyd album, right?
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:53.700]   This is literally just the polar.
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:54.540]   - Dark side of the moon.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.380]   - The dark side of the moon.
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:57.340]   The rainbow coming through
[02:14:57.340 --> 02:14:59.140]   when you take light and pass it through a prism.
[02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:00.500]   - Yeah.
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:02.820]   - I'm gonna say it's one degree.
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.860]   - So the rainbow's bigger?
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:05.700]   - No.
[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:06.520]   - The moon's bigger.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.340]   - It seems like roughly the same size,
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:09.860]   but when I think of a rainbow,
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:10.700]   I just think of like the large.
[02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:11.520]   - No, you're right.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.360]   It's the same size.
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:13.200]   - It's the same size of the sun.
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.040]   - Okay, so it's a trick question
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:14.860]   and I didn't actually get it right.
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:15.700]   - Exactly, that's right.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.520]   - Thank you very much.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.360]   - There you go.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:18.860]   Professor passes the test.
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:19.700]   - For once.
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.520]   - Yeah.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.620]   - Okay, next question.
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:24.940]   People obsess over this.
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:26.020]   I have my theories.
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:27.820]   I think it's still debated.
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.080]   When you watch a sunset,
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.980]   you get that beautiful long wavelength,
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:34.980]   short wavelength contrast that I blab about incessantly
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:36.380]   on the podcast and social media
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:38.380]   because that's what's setting your circadian clock.
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:41.240]   It's that orange, red tones
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.380]   and the blue tones of the sky.
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:46.580]   But right as the sun goes down across the horizon,
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:48.580]   especially over the ocean,
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:51.280]   there is the phenomenon known as the green flash.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.120]   - Yes.
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:53.660]   - What is the basis for the green flash?
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:54.820]   - Well, I'll tell you something really cool.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.100]   If you go to the South Pole,
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:59.220]   which is oversubscribed by a factor of 10 to one,
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:00.660]   you believe 10 times as many people
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:04.500]   want to spend their nine months of their year minimum
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.540]   at the South Pole,
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:07.580]   then we have room for to actually do work
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:08.420]   at the South Pole.
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:09.940]   - Which means 10 people total.
[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:11.180]   - No, there's 45 people there.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.020]   - I'm just kidding.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:12.840]   I'm just kidding.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:14.740]   - And they're all listening to you half the time.
[02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:17.020]   So when you wanna go there,
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:18.300]   when you go there,
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.380]   they actually don't know where the sun is gonna set.
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:23.460]   Remember, the sun only rises and sets once a year, right?
[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:26.260]   So it's one day and one night per year, six months long.
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:29.140]   Where the sun sets is unknown.
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:30.980]   And actually the days preceding it,
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:32.820]   the sun is making a big circle around your head.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:34.240]   I've seen this with the moon.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.220]   So the sun and the moon,
[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:36.500]   they just make a circle
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:38.260]   and slowly after reaching their apex
[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:39.300]   on the first day of summer,
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.620]   which is December 21st for them down there,
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:42.540]   upside down,
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:45.940]   eventually it crosses the horizon on March 21st,
[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:46.820]   around March 21st.
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:48.180]   That's the first day of fall
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:50.500]   or when they start getting ready for winter.
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:51.980]   They don't know where it's gonna go down.
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:53.520]   We think of it always going to the West,
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:55.420]   but where's West at the South Pole?
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:57.980]   Every direction you look is North, okay?
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:16:59.720]   So when this occurs,
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.580]   the actual phenomenon that you mentioned,
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.580]   the green flash can last for days or can last for hours.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:07.820]   So if you really are an aficionado of Huberman protocols
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:09.220]   and you want to see the green flash,
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.060]   apply to be down there.
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:11.980]   But the bad news is you're stuck there
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:13.740]   for nine more months, okay?
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:15.340]   So yes, it's a real phenomenon.
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:17.020]   Not only can you take pictures of it,
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:19.940]   but you can see it with your eye.
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:21.080]   The only correction I would say
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:24.020]   is you pretty much need to have a perfectly clear day.
[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:26.540]   You can't have any clouds on the horizon
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:27.980]   and it's best seen over the ocean.
[02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:29.100]   So we're blessed here.
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:31.900]   - But for those of us that don't end up at the South Pole,
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:33.780]   - Yeah. - God willing,
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:34.620]   send me pictures.
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.620]   - A lot of podcasts.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:37.060]   - I don't like environments that cold.
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:38.280]   - They really kill it there.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:41.980]   - But if I watch the sunset over the Pacific
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:46.380]   or I see the green flash sometimes,
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:47.820]   what's the basis of that?
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:48.660]   - Yeah.
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:52.260]   So the Earth's atmosphere is actually a,
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:54.260]   it's layered, okay?
[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:56.000]   But it's actually simpler to think about
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:56.960]   the Earth as being flat.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:59.380]   Now there's no, hopefully there's no flurfers out there
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:02.320]   thinking that Brian Keating is advocating the flat Earth.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.540]   But imagine this table, we're looking at a table.
[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:07.740]   Imagine there's a slab of translucent glass on it.
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:09.620]   And we're sitting at the, on the table,
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:12.020]   underneath the slab of glass, pretty thick glass, right?
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:13.780]   And you're looking straight up.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.620]   You look through a minimum amount of the glass, right?
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.640]   Straight up would be zenith at your local horizon.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.900]   Every direction you're looking is your horizon.
[02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:26.180]   You see off the edge of this flat Earth in this analogy.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:27.500]   When you look at a slight angle,
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:30.540]   you're going through more path length of the substrate,
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.540]   of the substance. - More glass.
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:32.420]   - More glass.
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:35.340]   Finally, if you did have this thing extending to infinity,
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:38.120]   you'd be looking through an infinite amount of atmosphere
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.020]   or glass when you're tangent to the horizon,
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:42.620]   when you're going parallel to the Earth's surface
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:43.980]   in this flat Earth analogy.
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:48.020]   The Earth's atmosphere is not only made of oxygen,
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:50.060]   it actually has a lot of particulates.
[02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:52.300]   And it's because of those particulates,
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:53.780]   a lot of them come from dust,
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:57.100]   and a lot of them come from volcanoes,
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:00.420]   and a large amount now comes from human-made sources,
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:01.760]   pollution and so forth.
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.380]   The more optical depth,
[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:05.360]   the more path length that you look through,
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:09.100]   the more scattering of the sun's light occurs.
[02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:10.500]   When scattering occurs,
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:13.740]   the longer wavelength light more easily penetrates
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:17.280]   through dust, smog particles, even glass, okay?
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:18.900]   So that goes through easier.
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:20.280]   And the short wavelengths,
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:23.620]   comparable to the intermolecular spacing of the smog,
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.600]   the dust, the gas in the atmosphere, the oxygen,
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.460]   scatters much more efficiently.
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.280]   And so that gets scattered out of the beam of light
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.140]   from the sun.
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.860]   The sun's light, though,
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:35.820]   actually peaks slightly in the green.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:38.020]   We don't actually notice this because our eyes are,
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:40.860]   and we're used to thinking of it as very yellow.
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:43.060]   It happens, and the reason for this can be,
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:46.060]   you know, substantiated by night vision glasses.
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.060]   What color is the light coming in?
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.100]   It's green, right?
[02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:50.860]   They amplify versions of these things.
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:51.700]   Why?
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:52.860]   Because your eye's very sensitive to green light.
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:54.400]   It's even more sensitive to green light
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:55.540]   than the yellow light.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:57.220]   So, and that's because the sun,
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:59.500]   which is what we've evolved to adapt to,
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:00.800]   being most sensitive to sunlight,
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.520]   is more greenish than yellow.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:05.560]   - So there's more power at the wavelength,
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.760]   like somewhere between like 450 and 550 nanometers.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:10.040]   - Exactly, 100% right.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:14.060]   So at that green flash, at that moment of green flash,
[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:15.260]   you're seeing two things.
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:17.120]   One is the sensitivity of the human eyes,
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.080]   it's slightly maximized to that.
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:21.760]   But that doesn't explain why photographs see it as well.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:24.200]   And the other reason is that most of the yellow light
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:26.160]   and the sunlight is getting scattered away,
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:27.880]   and so you're mainly seeing that green light.
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:31.800]   But you're only seeing it at the point of maximum scattering,
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:35.040]   which occurs exactly when the sun crosses the horizon.
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:36.000]   - Because of the interaction
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.520]   with all that atmospheric dust.
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:38.460]   - Exactly, yep.
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:41.240]   - That's wild, because for the longest time,
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:43.400]   I had a biological explanation for this
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.720]   that I think was based on a paper that was published,
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.180]   maybe in "Nature," but don't quote me on that.
[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:51.440]   - Just because it's published in "Nature"
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.640]   doesn't mean it's wrong.
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:57.120]   - I've got friends with a few "Nature" editors still,
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.400]   in a great journal.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:01.040]   Look, we could do a whole episode
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:02.800]   about "Nature," "Nature," "Science," and "Cell."
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:06.200]   But the explanation that was getting kicked around
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:08.640]   for a while was a biological explanation,
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.680]   which is that our ability to perceive reds and greens
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:16.200]   and blues and yellows is based on our trichromacy,
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.240]   the presence of these three different photoreceptors,
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.560]   short, medium, and long wavelength,
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:22.320]   or blue, green, red, so to speak,
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:25.640]   that absorb short, medium, or long-wavelength light.
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:28.580]   And then the comparison, there's this opponency,
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:33.040]   whereby our ability to see red is really contingent
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.240]   on our ability to perceive green.
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.280]   And so, like for someone who's red, green, colorblind,
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:39.560]   one in 80 males, for instance,
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.200]   they still see stuff out in the world that's red,
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:44.480]   but they see it as more orange-ish or brown.
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.320]   Dogs, the same way.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.840]   They're not colorblind.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:51.680]   True monochromats that don't see color are very rare.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.520]   That is one form, I think it's called achromatops, yeah.
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:57.080]   Don't quote me on that either.
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:00.360]   But in any case, the idea was that
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:01.400]   if you're looking at something
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.920]   that's very enriched in long wavelengths,
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.280]   like orange, red, and you stare at it for long enough,
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:08.560]   have you ever done that like American flag
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:10.760]   visual-optical illusion where you stare at it,
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:14.720]   then you look away from it and you see the opposite colors.
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:16.760]   And so, one biological explanation
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.480]   is that the sun is setting,
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:20.320]   and you're looking at this orange-red thing.
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:21.520]   When the sun is low in the sky,
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:25.280]   you can actually look at it without distressing your eyes,
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:28.160]   right, as opposed to overhead
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:29.600]   when you should never stare at the sun.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:33.200]   And then the moment that that reddish-orange disappears,
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.280]   the biological explanation is that
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.160]   there's a kind of perception of a green flash
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:41.080]   because of the opponent seeing the switch to the other,
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:43.520]   let's just say, wavelength channel, so to speak.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:44.800]   - I don't think that's in disagreement.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:47.480]   I think that might explain the amplification that we see,
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:49.280]   but then it doesn't explain why you'd see it
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:50.760]   in a photographic emulsion, right?
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.120]   There's nothing biological about it.
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:53.400]   - I like your explanation better
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:57.040]   because it's explained by real physics,
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:00.160]   and the biology of color-opponency is also physics,
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.980]   but not as well worked out.
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:04.980]   Okay, cool.
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:09.640]   Earlier, we were talking about the perceived relationship
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:12.840]   between the menstrual cycle, which is not always 28 days,
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:16.680]   but is on average 28 days, and the lunar cycle.
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:19.880]   Is there any evidence that, well, it'd be amazing
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:22.180]   if one influenced the other in the other direction,
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:24.160]   that the menstrual cycles were influencing the lunar cycle,
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:29.160]   but is there any evidence for a true relationship
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:35.160]   between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:36.360]   that's been documented?
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:37.520]   - I don't know.
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:39.800]   It's interesting, the sun also produces tides
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:42.160]   and produces gravitational effect,
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:44.400]   but the dominant effect on Earth,
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:47.080]   due to that 28-day, 29-day cycle of the moon,
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.640]   is its effect on the Earth's oceans,
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:52.160]   which produces four tides a day, too high and too low.
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:55.760]   And actually, Galileo incorrectly used that phenomenon
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.560]   as a way to buttress his argument
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:58.800]   that the Earth went around the sun.
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:00.320]   He basically, if you're listening,
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.920]   I'm taking my glass of Martina.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:03.600]   - Yerba Mate. - Yerba Mate, yeah.
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.400]   So he said that when the Earth is spinning,
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:08.220]   it rotates once per day,
[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:10.340]   but it's also revolving around the sun,
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:12.820]   so these combined motions make this sloshing of the liquid.
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:13.660]   You see that?
[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:16.680]   And he claimed that is what caused the tides on the Earth,
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.120]   when in fact, that's completely wrong.
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:19.400]   It's amazing, Andrew, when you think about
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.640]   how brilliant a scientist can be,
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.560]   and it's almost like the proportion of their blunder
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:26.360]   is proportionate to how brilliant they are.
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:27.800]   - Well, because it also correlates
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:31.480]   with the height of the problems they're chasing.
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:32.800]   - Exactly.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:36.240]   - You were saying that Galileo got certain things wrong,
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:37.400]   but got a number of things right.
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.880]   - That's right, Einstein, too, Newton, too.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.480]   - Being wrong for the right reasons
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:43.160]   is actually very important in science.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:46.480]   And by the right reasons, I mean that nobody's p-hacking,
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:48.280]   p-value hacking, or fudging data,
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:49.880]   that they're not tossing data.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:52.120]   They're really trying to solve problems.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:53.900]   It's almost like in sports,
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:56.840]   a great competitor wants great competitors.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.360]   But I mean, why would somebody want to cheat
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.360]   into a different weight class,
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.020]   knock somebody out, and consider themselves
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:04.720]   the world champion at that weight class?
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.640]   It's just silly, and in science,
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:10.880]   to not try and seek the truth is anti-science.
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.520]   Certainly it happens, but okay,
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:15.160]   so no clear evidence that the lunar cycle
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.680]   influences the menstrual cycle.
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.960]   - I would expect that it would influence other animals.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:20.880]   I don't know what the menstrual cycles are,
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.440]   deer or whatever, who knows?
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:25.440]   Or any animal that has an egg that--
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.160]   - Well, a lot of animals have not a menstrual cycle,
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:28.140]   but an estrous cycle.
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:32.200]   So a lot of rodents will have a four-day cycle.
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:35.400]   So it clearly doesn't map to the lunar cycle.
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.720]   But you hear a lot about these things,
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.200]   and humans are amazing at drawing correlations.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.880]   Again, we're a prediction-making machine.
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.040]   We're a storytelling machine, and--
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:46.200]   - And in the past, by the way,
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.760]   the moon was a lot closer than,
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.920]   not a lot, but it was closer.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:51.080]   The moon moves about the width of your,
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.660]   again, back to your fingers now.
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:54.800]   So the moon moves away by the width
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:57.500]   of about your thumb's fingernail every year.
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:58.340]   - Moves further away.
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:25:59.680]   - A centimeter away from the Earth,
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.800]   because there's a gravitational competition
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:03.840]   between the gravitational force of the moon,
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.040]   and the Earth's oceans provide a source of friction.
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.280]   So over the years, it's getting farther and farther away,
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.200]   such that it eventually won't be able
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:12.700]   to have total solar eclipses.
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:14.480]   It'll be, it's called an annular eclipse,
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:15.920]   where it doesn't obscure it completely.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:18.080]   Anyway, so in the past, this is the only way to say,
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.080]   millions of years ago,
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.080]   when the first hominids were evolving,
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:22.440]   the moon was much, much closer.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:25.240]   Millions of times of the Earth's fingernails
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:27.000]   eventually start to add up.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.360]   And certainly, when the first life formed on the Earth,
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:32.280]   it was only, it was probably 30 times closer
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:34.000]   than it is now, so yeah.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.040]   So short answer, I don't know.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:38.000]   - Where are some of the best places
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.280]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:43.760]   and please don't say the North Pole,
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.760]   where people can go see spectacular nighttime stuff.
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:52.720]   So I think of Yosemite High Country in August
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.360]   for the meteor shower.
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:56.760]   Certainly not at the level that you're accustomed
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.480]   to looking at things, but with the naked eye,
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.080]   you're gonna be, assuming that it's not cloudy,
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:04.440]   you're going to be treated to a light show
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.120]   that is, in my experience,
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:10.160]   beyond anything I've ever, just extraordinary.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:12.500]   - On my, the special website that I made,
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:14.360]   briankeating.com/huberman,
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.820]   I list the four major meteor showers,
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:18.880]   one in each season, that people can watch
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:19.720]   with your naked eye.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.240]   In fact, it's bad to use a telescope.
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:22.480]   You don't want a telescope.
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.920]   - 'Cause it juts through the field of view.
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:24.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.760]   You want the whole field of view,
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:27.640]   and humans have an amazing, as you know,
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:30.160]   a huge field of 190 degrees or something like that.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:33.240]   You know, just not as big as an owl, but quite big.
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:34.280]   And you want to take that in,
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:35.720]   'cause you're looking for motion,
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:36.640]   you're looking for intensity.
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:37.800]   Sometimes you can see colors,
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:39.880]   and I list what elements contribute
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.280]   to the colors of different meteorites
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.900]   on this website that I have.
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:47.340]   But yes, anywhere that's more than, say,
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:51.400]   20, 30, 40 miles away from a major city is fine.
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.260]   Even in San Diego, there's two dark sky communities.
[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:56.980]   One is called Julian, California,
[02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:59.020]   and the other one's the Anza-Borrego Desert,
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:00.460]   and it's called Borrego Springs.
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:03.980]   These are areas where they forbid upward-shining light,
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:06.300]   so the only light can be downward-facing.
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:09.120]   It also has to have very narrow spectral bands on it,
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:11.420]   so like sodium vapor, you know, very high,
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:13.140]   so that you can filter it out,
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:16.460]   basically with certain very inexpensive optical filters.
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:18.740]   But, you know, like I said, almost anywhere.
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:21.420]   But the good thing to know is that if you get a telescope,
[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:24.980]   again, you can see 90% of what's gonna be fascinating to you
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:28.740]   as a layperson with a telescope that costs $50.
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:29.740]   You can see all the craters,
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:30.980]   you can see mountains on the moon.
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:34.460]   And again, these mountains were not just like cool things.
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:37.140]   They destroyed, they falsified
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:39.440]   the scientific paradigm, quote-unquote,
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.280]   which was that the moon
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:43.440]   was perfectly crystalline and spherical.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.760]   Galileo showed, no, not only does it have mountains,
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:48.120]   I can measure the height of those mountains.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.280]   I can measure the planes of lava flows,
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.840]   and eventually they came up with theories
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.680]   that it doesn't have tectonic motion,
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:57.200]   it doesn't have an iron core.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:58.040]   I mean, it's amazing.
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.680]   You can see all these things with the small telescope,
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:03.400]   like the one I have for you,
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:06.360]   but you don't need like the Hubble telescope or Mount Will--
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:07.480]   you don't need any of that.
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:10.280]   You can see the rings of Saturn, the moons of Jupiter.
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:13.500]   You can even, on a dark sky without a telescope,
[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:16.320]   see an object that's outside of our galaxy.
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.280]   It's called the Andromeda Galaxy.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:19.800]   That's very important in the history of astronomy.
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:24.380]   In 1929, 1923 rather, on Mount Wilson, not far from here,
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:27.340]   Edwin Hubble realized that that was not part
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:28.500]   of the Milky Way galaxy.
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:32.160]   It was way too far away to be located within the Milky Way.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.740]   It was about 20 times the radius of the Milky Way.
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:38.900]   And that revolutionized all of our conceptions
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:41.560]   of where the universe is located, is it centered on us,
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:42.520]   are we the most important thing?
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:43.360]   No.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:46.220]   He showed that you can see that on most fall nights
[02:29:46.220 --> 02:29:48.160]   in the constellation Andromeda, with your naked eye.
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.080]   It's six times wider than the full moon.
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:51.080]   It's incredible.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:54.480]   - When I look at many of the constellations,
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:29:59.240]   I don't see how our ancient predecessors
[02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:02.640]   got to the description of a bear or whatever.
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:05.220]   Is that because they saw more stars than I did,
[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:07.820]   or is that because they had a wilder imagination,
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:09.680]   or were taking psychedelics or something like that?
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:13.420]   - 20 centuries before TikTok, so I cut them some slack.
[02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:15.620]   There are a couple that look similar to what they're,
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:16.460]   you know, Orion.
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.020]   - But it depends on how you connect the dots.
[02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:18.860]   - Yes.
[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:20.780]   - The Big Dipper and the Little Dipper are kind of like,
[02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.160]   okay, you get that.
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.220]   - Those aren't constellations.
[02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:24.060]   - Those aren't constellations.
[02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:27.340]   - I have to be, I have to put on my very, very precise.
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:28.420]   - Why are they not constellations?
[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:31.580]   - So they're portions of a constellation.
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:33.960]   So they're called asterisms.
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:36.680]   So an asterism is a collection of stars
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:37.960]   that's associated with each other,
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:41.120]   but it's not the full composition of a constellation.
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:43.080]   So the constellation is actually called Ursa Major.
[02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:46.040]   The Big Dipper's in the tail and the hindquarters
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:48.520]   of Ursa Major, which is the great bear.
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:51.400]   The Little Dipper is the asterism of seven stars
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.440]   that make up, there's 80-something stars
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:54.520]   that make up the little bear,
[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:56.280]   which actually doesn't look like a bear.
[02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:57.680]   Ursa Major kind of does look like
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:00.680]   the California Republic flag that we have.
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:04.780]   But yes, the asterism, I always ask for people to leave.
[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:07.140]   You can't, they're not making new constellations.
[02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:08.500]   There's only 88 constellations
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:12.500]   over the whole four-pi spherical dome of the sky.
[02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:15.140]   But you can leave your own asterism on the podcast.
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:17.860]   You can leave five stars on your podcast and mine.
[02:31:17.860 --> 02:31:19.300]   So you can't have a constellation,
[02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:20.700]   but you can have an asterism.
[02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:22.180]   - Love it.
[02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:24.960]   Did you catch Halley's Comet when it came by,
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:27.540]   when you were a few years older than I was?
[02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:29.980]   - I was 14, it was right after I got my first telescope.
[02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:32.320]   - It comes through every 70-something years.
[02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:33.920]   - Yeah, you're gonna make it to the next one, 76 years.
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:34.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:35.580]   - I'm right?
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:36.420]   - Yeah, that's very good, yeah.
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.500]   - I remember 70-something, all right, but.
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:39.820]   - It's not like the best constellation,
[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:41.600]   it's not like the best comet in history
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:42.780]   and there's better ones.
[02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:44.140]   - Yeah, I remember going out to see it.
[02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:45.780]   It was a part of a group that went camping
[02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:47.700]   and it looked like a smear of light.
[02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:49.340]   It's hard to know, did I really see it
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:51.500]   or did I not, in any case.
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:52.580]   - Your dad, you probably.
[02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:56.080]   - The only other comet that came to mind,
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:58.660]   oh, it was the San Diego thing.
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:01.300]   It was the Hale-Bopp where there was a group
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:03.080]   that committed mass suicide.
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:05.500]   Yeah, these were people that had castrated themselves,
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:08.260]   had been eating a sub-caloric,
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:10.420]   sub-maintenance caloric diet to live forever
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:13.460]   and then decide to wear Converse and kill themselves.
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:16.500]   What do you think, oh, let's not go dark there.
[02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:18.180]   What do you think is the relationship
[02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:22.460]   between comets and these wild human behaviors?
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:23.900]   - It's so interesting you mentioned that.
[02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:26.580]   - And lunacy, for that matter, like full moon and lunacy.
[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:28.860]   - Lunacy, right, crime statistics.
[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:32.620]   So look at these words, disaster, catastrophe.
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:35.320]   They asked, and both of those mean star.
[02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:38.380]   They used to believe that stars, comets, eclipses,
[02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:41.780]   those things were influencing events on Earth
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:44.940]   caused by these celestial forces for not propitiating them,
[02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:46.660]   making the gods happy or whatever.
[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:49.260]   And in fact, Columbus owes his life,
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:51.340]   he was almost killed in Jamaica.
[02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:55.100]   And I think it was 1498, a couple of years after discovering,
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:56.660]   yeah, he's still exploring.
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:59.780]   And he failed to ingratiate himself
[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:02.660]   with the local native inhabitants of Jamaica
[02:33:02.660 --> 02:33:05.680]   or wherever he was, and they were gonna kill him.
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:08.780]   And he luckily had on for navigation.
[02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:11.900]   Astronomy and navigation have always been intimately related
[02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:15.180]   because, first of all, if you know where Polaris is,
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.680]   which is not the brightest star,
[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:18.660]   it's in the Little Dipper, it's the pole star,
[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:20.200]   it's the north star, you've heard of it,
[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:21.460]   true north, north star.
[02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:23.820]   It's actually very close to being,
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:25.860]   if you go to the North Pole and look straight up,
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:28.260]   it's very close to being directly above you.
[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:29.700]   - And does it always mark true north?
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.600]   - In any human timescale it does,
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:34.180]   over thousands, tens of thousands of years it changes,
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:36.540]   but right now, for the next couple thousand years,
[02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:39.320]   so don't worry, you'll still be accurate,
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:40.820]   that is within a half a degree or so.
[02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:42.900]   - What do your brain thinks of these timescales?
[02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:45.880]   As long as you're talking for the next thousand years,
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:46.720]   you're good.
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:47.540]   - Well, I say it like this,
[02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:49.020]   the universe could end in a heat death
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:50.180]   and a big rip or whatever,
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:51.700]   but that's not for a trillion years,
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:54.660]   so everybody keep paying your taxes.
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:55.980]   So you could use it for navigation,
[02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:57.620]   so you could know your latitude,
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:59.980]   but measuring longitude was very difficult
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:01.540]   because you couldn't actually,
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:03.860]   to know longitude you need to measure time
[02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:06.340]   relative to where Greenwich Mean Time is,
[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:08.540]   that's how Greenwich became so important
[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:10.460]   and that's why London had this huge economy.
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:12.260]   Again, these things are always related,
[02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:15.060]   capitalism and even how we measure latitude and longitude
[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:17.500]   comes from the fact that London and Thames River,
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:18.820]   90% of the world's commerce
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.300]   flowed through there at one point or another,
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:21.240]   it's incredible.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:23.820]   So anyway, latitude and longitude is very important.
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:25.980]   The people started to know that,
[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:27.660]   yeah, these events would occur
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:29.660]   and including this event with Columbus
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:33.140]   and he brought along with him on his voyage an astronomer.
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:37.700]   And this astronomer knew that in two days time
[02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:40.540]   from when these natives had captured
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:42.020]   some of Columbus's crew,
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:44.020]   that there was gonna be a total solar eclipse
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:45.540]   and it was gonna go through Jamaica.
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:48.420]   And he told Columbus and Columbus said to the inhabitants,
[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:50.180]   "If you don't give our people back,
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:53.960]   "our God is gonna obscure and kill your God, the sun God."
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.640]   They're like, "F you," you know, whatever.
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:58.040]   And then it happened and they totally believed
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.080]   that they were in control of these celestial events,
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:02.080]   we better give the people back
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:03.680]   and Columbus got the hell out of there.
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.040]   So it's an amazing story.
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:07.280]   But yes, comets have always been a--
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.320]   - So Columbus actually used the sun
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:14.600]   as manipulative barter to-- - That's right, threat.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:15.840]   - As a threat. - Military, yeah,
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.740]   he used it for military coercion.
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:20.660]   - An important book for anyone to read
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:23.500]   who's interested in basically why we're still here,
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:26.700]   in my opinion, is the book "Longitude."
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:28.420]   - Yes, I'm interviewing-- - By Dava Sobel.
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:29.260]   - I'm interviewing her tomorrow.
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:31.220]   - This is an incredible book,
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.180]   doesn't require any science or technical background
[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:37.140]   to read and appreciate about the development
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:39.660]   of the first reliable timekeeping devices
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:44.660]   for navigating at sea, even on overcast nights.
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.320]   And finding longitude, it's a spectacular read.
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.200]   - It is. - And changed the way
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:54.960]   that I think about human evolution
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.800]   and technology development generally.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:58.480]   - There's a direct connection, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:00.660]   but there's a connection between that and the Nobel Prize.
[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:02.200]   So there was something called the Longitude Prize
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:05.200]   in the 1700s to develop a clock that could be used
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.600]   in the naval situations on boats.
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.920]   You couldn't use a grandfather clock
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:10.200]   as the pendulum-- - The boat's rocking.
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:12.440]   - Acceleration, so they had to find something
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:14.220]   and this guy, Thompson or somebody--
[02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:15.300]   - It's Harrison. - Harrison, yeah.
[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:17.340]   So he invented this mechanical clock,
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:20.140]   which predecessors of our modern wind-up clocks.
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:22.760]   Obviously, we use cesium and atomic clocks.
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.000]   But that prize for 10,000 pounds or whatever it was,
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.660]   was an early predecessor of the Nobel Prize.
[02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:31.180]   - I've been waiting this whole conversation
[02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:33.940]   to talk to you about adaptive optics.
[02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:35.860]   Let me give just a little bit of backdrop
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:37.340]   for how I'm approaching this.
[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:40.740]   In the field of neuroscience,
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:43.200]   there's, as with any field of biology,
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.920]   a desire to see smaller and smaller things
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:47.720]   at higher and higher resolution.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:49.640]   And there've been all sorts of incredible discoveries
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:52.160]   in microscopy, like two-photon microscopy,
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:54.520]   one-photon microscopy, electron microscopy.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.760]   You see things down to the tiny, tiny nanometer size.
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:02.320]   Some years ago, a group out of University of Rochester
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.800]   developed adaptive optics.
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:06.280]   I think it was David Williams's group,
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:07.880]   which is borrowed from astronomy.
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:10.700]   And my very top contour understanding of this
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:16.260]   is that you're using the presence of noise
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.940]   in the environment, essentially,
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:20.420]   as part of the microscope to get a better image.
[02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:23.660]   And this was used in the field of ophthalmology
[02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:25.220]   to look into the back of the eye.
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:28.060]   This incredible three-cell layer-thick pie crust
[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:29.300]   that lines the back of our eyes,
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.340]   that it gives us all of our visual perception,
[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:34.580]   not alone, but allows for all of our visual perception.
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:36.900]   As I mentioned before, the eye has a lens,
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:38.860]   there's vitreous, there's all sorts of opportunity
[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:40.340]   for light scatter.
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:42.540]   And then within the eye itself,
[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:44.900]   you've got these multiple layers you have to go through
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:46.840]   before you can see the photoreceptors.
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:49.360]   But using adaptive optics, you can take all that noise,
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.660]   all that stuff between the microscope
[02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:55.500]   and what you want to see way, way back in the eye,
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:58.940]   and use that, in air quotes here, noise,
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:01.860]   and make it part of the microscope, so to speak.
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:05.100]   And without going into further detail there,
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:08.140]   I was always told that adaptive optics
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:12.320]   was borrowed from your field, astronomy,
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:15.420]   where people use the presence of atmosphere dust
[02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:17.740]   of these stuff in the way,
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:20.620]   and made it part of the lens, if you will,
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:22.940]   to be able to see things at higher resolution,
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:24.280]   which I just think is so incredible.
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:28.620]   It's like saying the barrier becomes the portal
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.780]   through which you can see even more
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:32.300]   than had you had a clear path.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.140]   - The obstacle is the way.
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:33.960]   Let's shout out to Ryan. - The obstacle is the way.
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:35.020]   All right, shout out to Ryan. - Let's shout out to Ryan.
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:36.620]   - Ryan Holliday, yeah, never met him,
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:37.860]   but I like that book very much.
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:42.860]   Okay, so what is adaptive optics for astronomers?
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:45.620]   - Okay, so we live in an atmosphere,
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:47.020]   a planet with an atmosphere, thank God.
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:49.780]   We wouldn't be here having this conversation, right?
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:52.020]   And that atmosphere is a dirty window.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.920]   It's like literally looking through the windshield
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.420]   of your car, and it's cloudy and dusty and contaminated.
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:01.540]   We live in its presence.
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:03.720]   And the best astronomical telescopes
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:05.580]   are the ones that are launched above the atmosphere,
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:06.420]   out of the atmosphere.
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:08.140]   Hubble Space Telescope, Kepler,
[02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:09.640]   and now the James Webb Telescope.
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:12.140]   Again, those are multi-billion dollar telescopes,
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:13.760]   the James Webb to build it.
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:16.140]   And by the way, one lesson to leave you with
[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:17.700]   and maybe your audience with as well
[02:39:17.700 --> 02:39:20.860]   is whenever you hear a scientific instrument's cost,
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:23.300]   always in your mind, at least double it.
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:24.660]   Andrew Lang, my late great mentor,
[02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:26.380]   used to say multiply by pi.
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:29.340]   Because A, you're not taking into account the fact
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:31.620]   that you don't build, say, a destroyer
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:33.500]   or an aircraft carrier to build it.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:34.820]   You build it to use it.
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:38.780]   And it's about 10% of the construction cost
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:40.940]   to operate an instrument, a battleship,
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:42.260]   a telescope, whatever.
[02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:44.620]   It's a rule of thumb that project managers love to use.
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.420]   So that means in 10 years, it's gonna double the price.
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:48.460]   And we hope that Hubble and Webb,
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:50.820]   and Hubble's already lasted 40 years on it.
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:51.660]   So it'll last a long time.
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:53.960]   So whenever you hear this, but it's incredibly expensive.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:57.140]   One kilogram used to cost like $10,000 to bring to orbit.
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:59.760]   And Elon keeps talking about how cheap it's gonna be,
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.700]   but he has yet to launch a scientific instrument.
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:04.220]   I talked to him for 10 minutes on my podcast once,
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.980]   and I tried to get him to shut off these.
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.260]   Starlinks are amazing.
[02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:09.780]   I have one in my house.
[02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:11.260]   But they have the property
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:13.500]   that they go through astronomical images,
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:15.920]   and they leave a satellite trail behind them,
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.260]   which can be, you're taking a picture of a deep star,
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:22.400]   a deep galaxy or whatever,
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:23.900]   and you see these streaks going through it.
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:26.140]   It ruins the image, and you have to wait until they're gone.
[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:27.780]   But at least in optical astronomy,
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:30.740]   you can physically, literally paint those satellites black,
[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:32.260]   and they will no longer reflect,
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:34.140]   and so they won't obscure the image whatsoever.
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:35.900]   - So you're saying that the Starlink satellites
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:38.540]   are gonna make your job more difficult.
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:39.760]   - They definitely are,
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:43.700]   because while you can paint an optical satellite black
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:46.140]   and make it black, we're looking for heat.
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:50.260]   There's no way to stealth confuse or block out heat.
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:52.260]   Sorry, that's a law of thermodynamics.
[02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:53.700]   Anything that's above absolute zero
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:55.180]   will always give off heat.
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:58.420]   And worst of all, the signals that he uses
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:00.860]   are in the exact microwave spectral range
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:02.340]   that we use to look at the CMB,
[02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:03.540]   the cosmic microwave background.
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:04.780]   - So what's his response to this?
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:06.140]   - I told him that--
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:08.060]   - Having internet everywhere is more important.
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:10.380]   - No, he said he would look into it.
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:12.900]   Nine months ago, Elon, I know you like the show,
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:14.180]   so please do reach out to me,
[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:15.560]   but this would be just turning it off
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:17.060]   when it's over our telescope, basically.
[02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:18.660]   That's what I, and the South Pole.
[02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:19.500]   So it's not a big deal.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:20.620]   - So you have a specific request.
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:21.460]   - There's no one at the,
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:22.900]   it's not like he's getting millions of dollars
[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:24.700]   in ad revenue from people at the South Pole.
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:26.020]   They don't use 'em.
[02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:28.940]   So anyway, I'm asking Elon, it's a small ask.
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:31.880]   But anyway, so we wanna be above the atmosphere,
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:33.940]   but it's millions, maybe billions of dollars
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:35.500]   to do that for a telescope like we're using,
[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:38.700]   or for an optical telescope here on Earth.
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:41.180]   So scientists became very convinced
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.740]   that there has to be a way
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:44.660]   to mitigate the effects of the atmosphere.
[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.980]   Now, what is the main effect of the atmosphere?
[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:48.780]   Well, you learned it when you were a kid.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.620]   Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:52.740]   What is that twinkling?
[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:54.380]   It's called scintillation.
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:57.180]   Scintillation is the property of a point source,
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.840]   which is a star is so far away,
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:41:59.900]   even though they're enormous,
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:02.940]   they still only subtend a zero-dimensional,
[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:06.020]   almost zero-dimensional dot of light on the sky.
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:07.980]   When it goes through the atmosphere,
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:10.860]   the atmosphere has macroscopic turbulence features.
[02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:12.280]   The atmosphere is a fluid.
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.060]   There's turbulence, there's roiling columns,
[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:15.380]   there's cells of the atmosphere.
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:16.780]   And if you've ever looked at a star,
[02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:19.820]   they jitter, they, looks like they're moving around.
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:22.940]   And that's the combination of the atmospheric cells,
[02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:25.900]   each column of air that has slightly more density
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:29.100]   will refract light slightly different angles.
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.460]   Remember we talked about light when it goes through a lens,
[02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:32.660]   it refracts, it bends.
[02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:34.860]   - So should we be thinking about the light from stars
[02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:37.340]   kind of like a jagged line coming towards our eye?
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:39.380]   - It's coming through, it's getting deflected slightly,
[02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:40.220]   and it's moving,
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:41.940]   and it's landing on different retinal cells.
[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:43.740]   And we're perceiving that as this motion,
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:46.820]   or in a CCD array, it's also landing on different pixels.
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:50.220]   So you can't get away from it by using technology.
[02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:51.460]   It's still an effect,
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.940]   it's caused by these atmospheric turbulent cells.
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:56.980]   And by the way, you can tell and you can identify a planet
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:42:59.180]   by the fact that it does not scintillate,
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:00.860]   it does not twinkle, twinkle.
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:02.220]   So Jupiter's visible tonight,
[02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:03.500]   I hope you'll see it with the telescope,
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:05.780]   we can see it after we're done recording.
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:07.940]   We'll keep going, we're about halfway done, I figure.
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:09.020]   We'll go outside, we'll look at it,
[02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:10.940]   and you'll see it's not, it's stationary.
[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:12.740]   And I actually used that on the night
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:14.020]   I kissed my wife for the first time.
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:15.660]   But I'm not gonna talk about that.
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.100]   When you look at the planet,
[02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:19.940]   you can identify them by their lack of scintillation.
[02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:24.100]   It's a way to identify if it's a plane, a star, or a planet.
[02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:26.660]   So astronomers, including a colleague of mine
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:28.900]   in UC system, Claire Max, and other people,
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:31.300]   realized in the 1960s and '70s
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.980]   that if they had a fake star,
[02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:37.220]   it's actually called either a guide star
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:38.980]   or an artificial star,
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:40.540]   I'll explain how they make that in a minute,
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:43.620]   then if they knew the exact properties of that guide star,
[02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:45.420]   then they could measure just the guide star
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:47.380]   through the same optics of the telescope,
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:48.700]   and then they would broadcast,
[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:51.460]   they would take the light from that artificial star
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:53.780]   onto a flexible, deformable mirror.
[02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:56.780]   So the mirror could actually wobble and wiggle,
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:00.580]   and it would do so in an exactly compensatory way
[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:03.220]   to nullify the atmospheric turbulence.
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:05.180]   So it's basically what light does
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:07.740]   when it goes through a cell of the atmosphere.
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:10.060]   It traverses a slightly longer path difference,
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:12.540]   so they would shorten the path difference of the mirror.
[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:13.700]   They make it a little bit closer
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:14.900]   in the direction of that cell,
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:16.900]   and other places they'd make it farther away,
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:18.020]   and vice versa.
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:19.780]   They compensate for it,
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:22.380]   and this was done by a combination of two technologies.
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:24.460]   One was the deformable mirror
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.420]   that could flex 100 times per second,
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:30.700]   and the other was making these artificial stars.
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:32.180]   So how do they make an artificial star?
[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:35.100]   They shoot a laser into the troposphere.
[02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:36.620]   That laser illuminates--
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:37.660]   - What's the troposphere?
[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:39.780]   - Troposphere is a layer of the atmosphere.
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:41.300]   I used to know all the different layers, but--
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:42.140]   - That's okay.
[02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:43.540]   - Okay, ionosphere is the farthest away.
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:44.500]   - So some layer of the atmosphere.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:47.140]   - Yeah, it's 40, 30, 40 kilometers above the Earth.
[02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:48.380]   It's not quite in space.
[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:51.340]   Far enough away that the laser beam is still collimated.
[02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:53.100]   It makes a nice beam, and it can illuminate,
[02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:57.460]   and then cause this sodium ions to fluoresce, basically.
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:58.820]   So they start to get really stimulated.
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:00.380]   It looks just like a star.
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:02.020]   They know exactly how they produced it.
[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:04.460]   They know exactly what phase and wavelength
[02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:05.540]   to correct in the mirror,
[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:08.220]   and then they say it's almost as good as going into space.
[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:10.380]   It corrects exactly the compensation
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:12.140]   of the Earth's atmosphere
[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:13.940]   with the combination of this deformable mirror,
[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:15.300]   and it was actually used by my colleague,
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:17.500]   Andrea Ghez, here at UCLA,
[02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:20.100]   to measure the properties of stars
[02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:21.660]   orbiting around the black hole
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:23.260]   at the center of the Milky Way,
[02:45:23.260 --> 02:45:25.460]   and test Einstein's theory of relativity.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:28.060]   Without this and the twin 10-meter diameter
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.500]   Keck telescopes in Hawaii,
[02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:31.260]   she never would have won that Nobel Prize.
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:34.500]   So it's amazing technology, but it was classified.
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:38.280]   It was so useful to astronomers,
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:40.180]   but it wasn't as useful as to the military.
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:42.460]   Remember, I said Galileo used his telescope
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:45.020]   to sell it to the military of Venice.
[02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:48.420]   It was immediately classified by the US military,
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:50.540]   because if you think about a spy satellite,
[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:51.380]   what's it doing?
[02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:52.980]   Well, it's staring down to Earth,
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:55.660]   and it's looking at whatever on Earth.
[02:45:55.660 --> 02:45:56.980]   It's also going through the atmosphere.
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.400]   It's gonna have the same problems.
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:45:59.540]   So they wanted to use that
[02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:01.740]   and have this technological advantage over the Soviets,
[02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:03.540]   probably in the 1970s and '80s.
[02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:04.500]   So they classified it.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:05.740]   They didn't let many...
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.060]   Astronomers could build things.
[02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:08.900]   They could deliver the finished product,
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:10.220]   but they couldn't patent it.
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:11.060]   They couldn't use it.
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:14.220]   So Claire Max, as I said, she could have been super rich.
[02:46:14.220 --> 02:46:16.620]   But it's interesting, 'cause now they're using it,
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:20.500]   so it's bad enough to look from Earth to space.
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:22.380]   But as I said, if you imagine the Earth
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:24.540]   as having a slab of an atmosphere,
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:25.620]   imagine a sniper.
[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:27.620]   The sniper's trying to make a kill shot.
[02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:29.420]   Jocko's out there trying to hit something
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:31.900]   five kilometers, three kilometers away or whatever.
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:33.780]   There's a lot of atmosphere in the way.
[02:46:33.780 --> 02:46:35.980]   And if you're looking through an optical sight,
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:36.800]   that will also happen.
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:41.080]   So now they're actually using this optical compensation
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:43.240]   and sniper scopes are using this technology,
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:44.600]   adaptive optics.
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:46.360]   So it's another way that astronomy has
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:49.360]   influenced military developments as well.
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:50.200]   - Very interesting.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.160]   I don't wanna go too far down this rabbit hole,
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:56.560]   but I'm aware that there are some technologies now
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:01.440]   to use lasers to extract sound waves in a similar way.
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:03.360]   So there are technologies that exist
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:05.800]   where you can shine a laser at, say, a window on a building
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:07.000]   from very far away and actually hear
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.120]   the conversation inside the room
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.840]   by way of the sound waves hitting that window.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.440]   The conversion of sound waves to optical
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.520]   and then from optical back to sound on your computer
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.360]   allows that.
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:20.920]   Also, there was a technology that was publicized
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:24.080]   a few years back, developed at least in part at Stanford,
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.480]   the ability to see around corners
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.480]   by shining lasers at the most visible location
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:31.240]   closest to what you wanna see,
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:34.260]   and then capturing reflections and sound waves
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:36.120]   at that location and essentially being able
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:38.640]   to reconstruct images around corners,
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:39.800]   see how many objects are there.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.520]   So pretty wild stuff.
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:43.920]   You can imagine the military and spy implications,
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:48.880]   but also just, but perhaps just as interesting,
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:52.840]   the ability to, for instance, map the positions
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.440]   and movements of critters in the deep ocean
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:57.920]   without actually having to quote-unquote see them.
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:59.480]   You could hear them.
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:01.440]   I had a really interesting experience a few summers back
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:02.520]   of going to somebody's pool.
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:03.560]   It was an impressive pool,
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:04.820]   but the most impressive thing about it
[02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:08.620]   was that you could hear music perfectly well underwater
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:11.880]   using adaptive acoustics.
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:13.360]   - And listening to your episode with Goggins.
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:14.200]   - No, it was wild.
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:15.880]   You could dive, you'd listen to something above water,
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:18.300]   dive below water and still hear it
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:20.400]   as if it were playing in the headphones.
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.120]   Maybe not quite as well as in headphones,
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:24.100]   but, and if you sloshed around in the water,
[02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:25.280]   there'd be a little perturbation,
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:26.480]   but it's pretty spectacular.
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:27.920]   It wasn't my pool, unfortunately.
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:32.720]   I have one big question that I think everybody
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:34.040]   would like the answer to,
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:36.360]   which is to what extent do you think
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.360]   there's life outside earth or not on earth?
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:45.060]   And when people hear this, they think aliens,
[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:48.480]   but like an insect-like creature,
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:51.440]   single or small multi-cell organism on another planet,
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:54.440]   that itself would be a spectacular find.
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:57.480]   I mean, beyond spectacular,
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:01.120]   is there any evidence that that does exist?
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:04.280]   Is there any reason to think that it couldn't exist?
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:06.200]   And if it does, would it have to be
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.240]   in a different galaxy altogether?
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:12.760]   What's the going belief among those
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:15.800]   who are like real scientists who don't believe
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:18.560]   that there's whatever, just real scientists,
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.000]   like what's the thought?
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.960]   Like a centipede on Mars?
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:24.320]   Like I don't think too many people
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.320]   would be totally surprised, but that'd be pretty wild.
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.240]   - Well, yeah, I'm kind of an outlier,
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:34.720]   so just everyone should look to the actual experts
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.960]   in this field, but I have some rigorous
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:39.440]   kind of logical arguments that I believe
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:42.320]   the probability of life, I would never say it's zero,
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:43.440]   but I think it's very low,
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:45.440]   and I think I can substantiate that,
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:47.880]   and the best part is I can't be falsified right now.
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.840]   There's zero evidence that there's life
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:51.440]   anywhere else in the universe, period,
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:52.800]   full stop, end of sentence.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:54.640]   There's no evidence, conclusive evidence.
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:55.480]   In fact-- - Lots of drones
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:56.800]   over in New Jersey right now,
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:49:58.280]   not no evidence of life.
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:49:59.780]   - I knew we'd get into drones.
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:04.160]   So the argument that it would somehow,
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:06.920]   first of all, transform our understanding
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:09.160]   of human place is inarguable to me.
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:13.440]   I believe that's true, although in this movie "Contact,"
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:14.920]   it's a really wonderful movie.
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:16.160]   It's not cheesy science fiction.
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:17.720]   It was the first to use a wormhole
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:19.680]   and all sorts of cool stuff as contrivances,
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:21.840]   but in that movie, there's a scene
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:24.840]   where President Bill Clinton is talking
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:28.000]   about the discovery that this fictitious character made,
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.260]   but he's actually talking about a meteorite
[02:50:30.260 --> 02:50:32.280]   that was discovered in Antarctica,
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:33.640]   and they just clipped that,
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:37.320]   and the meteorite was believed to have microbial life,
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:41.480]   and that meteorite's origin was inarguably from Mars, okay?
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:44.000]   So the reasoning was, this is 1997,
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.800]   that there was a meteorite found in Antarctica
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:48.080]   where it's easy to find meteorites.
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:49.320]   - Is it in the movie or in real life?
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:50.160]   - It's in real life.
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:52.320]   In 1997, a scientist announced the discovery
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:53.800]   of a meteorite from Antarctica.
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:56.120]   It's called Allen Land Hill's meteorite,
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:57.960]   and it had what they claimed
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.720]   were evidence of microbial life
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:01.920]   and even respiration byproducts
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:03.920]   of these microbial life forms, okay?
[02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:06.640]   It was such a big deal that within minutes,
[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:09.320]   Bill Clinton had a press conference on the White House lawn
[02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:11.320]   where he goes, "This rock speaks to us
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:13.900]   "from across the generations, and if confirmed,
[02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:17.080]   "will undoubtedly revolutionize our understanding
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:18.760]   "of the universe around us," okay?
[02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:20.840]   Now, the movie clips that clip to make it seem
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:22.460]   like Ellie, the fictitious character,
[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:26.940]   discovered SETI, extraterrestrial technology,
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:30.500]   not a microbe, but in the public's mind,
[02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:35.500]   that actual scientific discovery was never falsified.
[02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:36.820]   It was certainly never confirmed.
[02:51:36.820 --> 02:51:38.860]   No one's ever come back to say that was correct
[02:51:38.860 --> 02:51:40.960]   and that we did find microbial evidence
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:42.480]   of microbial life on Mars.
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:43.980]   Now, how did that meteorite get there?
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:48.020]   Well, some asteroids hit the moon.
[02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:49.420]   That's why it has craters on it.
[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:50.780]   It hits the Earth.
[02:51:50.780 --> 02:51:52.900]   That's why we have Meteor Crater, Arizona,
[02:51:52.900 --> 02:51:55.540]   Winslow, Arizona, Yucatan, Chicxulub,
[02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:57.660]   where the dinosaur's doom was sealed
[02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:00.660]   by the giant impactor 66 million years ago.
[02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:03.260]   Those impacts occur on every planet,
[02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:05.240]   every moon in our solar system.
[02:52:05.240 --> 02:52:08.700]   So some asteroid hit the surface of Mars
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.100]   probably millions of years ago,
[02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:13.820]   ejected material, low gravity on Mars, low atmosphere,
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:16.220]   and that material has been orbiting around
[02:52:16.220 --> 02:52:18.860]   and eventually made its way and hit the Earth, okay?
[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:21.460]   So matter from Mars landed on the Earth.
[02:52:21.460 --> 02:52:22.460]   Does that make sense?
[02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.940]   That's how I gave you, I have a lunar meteorite
[02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:26.180]   that I'm giving to you, again,
[02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:29.160]   as a token of my appreciation for all you do.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:30.220]   That came the same way.
[02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:32.580]   Something hit the moon, blasted off some lunar,
[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:34.780]   it's called breccia, it's the crust of the moon,
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:37.220]   eventually made its way, landed in Northwest Africa,
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:39.580]   and I bought a slice of it from a, I got a dealer,
[02:52:39.580 --> 02:52:41.420]   you know, I got a meteorite dealer,
[02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:43.640]   and I got that for you, okay?
[02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:44.860]   So what's the lesson?
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:47.780]   Material gets exchanged from planet to planet.
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:49.780]   Now, I ask the following question.
[02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:52.020]   If that happened on Mars to the Earth,
[02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:53.100]   the moon to the Earth,
[02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:56.900]   so too has material from the Earth been ejected.
[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:01.220]   Since life emerged 3.7 billion years ago,
[02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:03.980]   there's literally millions of tons of Earth
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:05.460]   that's floating around in space.
[02:53:05.460 --> 02:53:07.040]   Some of that will have landed on Mars.
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:09.700]   So someday we'll get there, we'll find some piece of it.
[02:53:09.700 --> 02:53:12.020]   Now, could some of it have a tardigrade on it?
[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:14.220]   Could some of it have a protozoan on it?
[02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:16.060]   Obviously it could.
[02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:18.580]   - Maybe some interesting microbes.
[02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:19.420]   - Yeah, it could.
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:22.820]   - Maybe some ancient microbes that are no longer extant.
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:23.660]   - Yeah, it could.
[02:53:23.660 --> 02:53:25.200]   It could have, what's an adaptogen?
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:26.040]   I have no idea.
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:26.860]   - An adaptogen?
[02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:27.700]   - You talk about adaptogens.
[02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:30.900]   - Adaptogens are, it's a broad term used to describe
[02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:34.220]   any compound that allows you
[02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:36.700]   to modulate the stress response.
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:38.780]   So maybe increase your stress threshold
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:41.100]   or recover from stress more quickly.
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:43.140]   It's sort of like saying stimulant.
[02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:44.980]   - Okay, it's not biological necessarily.
[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:46.900]   - No, it's a broad category.
[02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:49.060]   I mean, I think some people will say
[02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:52.320]   like certain non-hallucinogenic mushroom strains
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:53.160]   are adaptogens.
[02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:55.600]   I mean, the ability to buffer the stress response.
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:56.700]   - Interesting.
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:58.540]   - I mean, things like rhodiola
[02:53:58.540 --> 02:54:00.180]   have been described as adaptogens
[02:54:00.180 --> 02:54:02.180]   and these work through neurotransmitter systems.
[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:06.380]   So broadly speaking, they allow you to perceive effort
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:08.300]   as less effortful, this kind of thing.
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:11.020]   - Okay, so one theory of the formation of life on Earth,
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.180]   you asked me about that earlier,
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:13.980]   the origin of life on Earth is a huge mystery.
[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:15.100]   How did life get here?
[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:18.180]   One proposition was made by Fred Hoyle and other people.
[02:54:18.180 --> 02:54:21.100]   It sounds dirty, but it's not, it's called panspermia.
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:23.540]   Just means that genetic material has been transferred
[02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:27.220]   from another astronomical object landed here on Earth.
[02:54:27.220 --> 02:54:30.860]   So the converse reaction occurs as well.
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:33.700]   But the fact is we don't observe it even on Mars.
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:36.500]   So if I told you, we've discovered a planet
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:38.300]   and there's another planet right next to it
[02:54:38.300 --> 02:54:39.840]   and it has almost the same conditions.
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:41.500]   It's in the so-called Goldilocks zone
[02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:43.380]   where the temperature is just right to have liquid water,
[02:54:43.380 --> 02:54:45.180]   which Mars can have on it at certain times of the year
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:46.580]   in certain places on Mars.
[02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:48.540]   It had flowing water on it, we know for sure.
[02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:49.980]   Mars had flowing water on it.
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:52.220]   We know for sure that material from the Earth got there
[02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:53.860]   when Earth had life on it.
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:56.740]   So the absence of life on Mars is a data point.
[02:54:56.740 --> 02:55:00.140]   It's not probative or provative, it's positive rather,
[02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:01.780]   that life couldn't exist on Mars.
[02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:03.460]   We haven't searched all of Mars.
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:05.980]   But it at least shows that there's an impediment to it.
[02:55:05.980 --> 02:55:08.960]   So people are fond of saying, as I told you earlier,
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:11.460]   there's about 10 to the 24th planets
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:13.500]   probably in our observable universe.
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:14.960]   Going back to the Big Bang,
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:16.860]   going out to the farthest reaches of the universe.
[02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:19.220]   But even if you just take the Milky Way galaxy,
[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:23.420]   there's probably literally hundreds of billions of planets
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:25.100]   in our galaxy alone.
[02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:28.380]   And when you look at that, people like to say,
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:30.160]   as Carl Sagan did, if there's no life,
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:32.060]   it's an awful waste of space, right?
[02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:34.020]   Why is there so much space and there's no life?
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:35.260]   It seems incomprehensible.
[02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:39.140]   But nature, I love when atheist scientists will say,
[02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:41.940]   you propose God exists and that's the God of the gaps
[02:55:41.940 --> 02:55:43.500]   to explain things that you don't understand.
[02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:45.840]   But when science advances, we'll have an explanation
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:47.380]   for why thunder occurs.
[02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:49.020]   It's not because of Thor, right?
[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:50.780]   We get rid of gods as we learn more,
[02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:53.300]   and so the gaps shrink smaller and smaller.
[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:55.420]   But they'll say the same argument about life in the air.
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:56.780]   They'll say, well, there's gotta be life
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:58.000]   'cause there's so much room there.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.260]   But as I told you, I've been to Antarctica twice.
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:03.960]   The only life forms I saw there, okay, were people.
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:06.460]   I saw a few penguins in the distance
[02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:08.360]   and a couple of dead sea lions.
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:10.860]   There's no trees, there's no flora at all
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:11.820]   in the entire continent.
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:14.960]   It's incredibly barren, and yet, Andrew,
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:19.460]   it makes up 8% of the land mass of the Earth.
[02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:21.380]   And you would think, well, it's just proportional
[02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:23.380]   to the amount of area, i.e. the number of stars.
[02:56:23.380 --> 02:56:25.140]   There should be 8% of the life on Earth.
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:27.220]   There should be a billion people there or whatever,
[02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:28.700]   you know, 600 million people.
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:29.980]   No, there's nothing there
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:31.500]   except for scientists that go there.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:34.660]   So the odds of life, you know,
[02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:38.060]   you can't construct probability from possibility.
[02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:40.620]   That, and many, many other arguments that I could give you,
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:44.260]   the improbability of life, how hard it is to create life.
[02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:45.900]   And, you know, if you just sprinkled,
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:48.020]   imagine you had a koala cannon, okay?
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:49.300]   People at PETA are gonna get mad.
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:51.980]   Imagine if you just go to Mars and spray it with koala.
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:52.820]   It's obviously not gonna, like, start life, right?
[02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:54.840]   - Well, I think PETA would probably be okay
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:58.820]   with you populating an area with koalas.
[02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:01.580]   A cannon to take out koalas, they would probably protest.
[02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:02.900]   - That's right, they would not like that.
[02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:07.300]   So yeah, so, you know, possibility is not probability.
[02:57:07.300 --> 02:57:11.740]   The number of hurdles to create a single cell is enormous.
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:13.480]   We have yet to reproduce, you know,
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:15.340]   to make a functional cell in the laboratory.
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:16.560]   Not that that's a requirement
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:18.420]   to prove that life could exist elsewhere.
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:19.820]   I'm just saying it's very hard.
[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:21.980]   Our history of life, we have an N of one.
[02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:24.180]   It's very difficult to speculate on.
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:26.900]   And if we're alone, if life is abundant,
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:30.300]   as Fermi asked many, many, many years ago,
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:34.380]   if life is abundant and the galaxy is old, where are they?
[02:57:34.380 --> 02:57:35.700]   Where are the aliens?
[02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:36.840]   There should have been plenty of time,
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:39.580]   not only for them to evolve and be superior to us
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:42.700]   in many ways and travel the distances of our galaxy,
[02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:45.180]   not even of the cosmos, our galaxy, where are they?
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.020]   Where are they?
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:47.300]   They've known about us for 80 years
[02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:48.740]   'cause we've been broadcasting radio waves
[02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:50.300]   for the last 85 years.
[02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:52.840]   - Do you know this theory about the gut microbiota?
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:56.500]   You know, our guts, our skin, our eyes, our nose,
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:59.780]   but certainly our entire digestive tract,
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:03.980]   the whole way down from our lips, out the other end,
[02:58:03.980 --> 02:58:05.820]   are populated with these little microbiota
[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:07.920]   that influence everything from fatty acid production,
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:09.320]   neurotransmitter production, et cetera.
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:10.520]   - It's more than human cells.
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:13.120]   - Yeah, oh yeah, and it's powerful for modulating
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:14.920]   all sorts of biological processes.
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:17.480]   And every time we interact, shake hands,
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:20.760]   if people kiss, if you interact with dirt,
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:23.880]   if you interact with a pet, the microbiome changes.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:28.400]   It's an inner reflection of all your outer behaviors.
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:29.640]   - Like the internet, yeah.
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:31.240]   - Yeah, and then we're learning a lot about it.
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:32.560]   There's this one theory that I like
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:36.140]   that kind of turns life, as you and I know it,
[02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:39.620]   on its head, which is that humans and other species
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:42.900]   are just vehicles for the microbiome.
[02:58:42.900 --> 02:58:45.540]   And so you would take something like the desire
[02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:50.540]   to populate Mars or to land on the moon
[02:58:50.540 --> 02:58:53.780]   as just the microbiota, taking advantage
[02:58:53.780 --> 02:58:56.020]   of this weird old world primate species
[02:58:56.020 --> 02:58:59.500]   that we call homo sapiens that loves to develop technology,
[02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:01.680]   almost destroy itself, but then continues
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:04.760]   to evolve social media, et cetera.
[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:05.600]   - Yeah, Kim Prae there.
[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:07.560]   - Warn each other about declining birth rates.
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:11.520]   And then just to, basically, the microbiota have what,
[02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:13.640]   you know, a sort of quote-unquote consciousness,
[02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:15.400]   not a brain, but a consciousness of their own,
[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:18.160]   which is like all species, to make more of itself
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:20.280]   and to go further and further out and populate.
[02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:23.880]   It's hard to punch holes in the logic of this model,
[02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:28.160]   but it certainly diminishes our conscious experience.
[02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:31.020]   - We could go on forever about this trail.
[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:33.700]   I'll just kind of put a kind of a cliffhanger out there.
[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:35.860]   It'd be wonderful sometime to sit down with you
[02:59:35.860 --> 02:59:37.580]   and discuss the possibility of,
[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:41.420]   rather than thinking about life elsewhere in the galaxy,
[02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:45.820]   given what we know about physics and engineering,
[02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:48.540]   astronomy, et cetera, would it be possible
[02:59:48.540 --> 02:59:51.560]   to build a planet at the appropriate distance from the sun
[02:59:51.560 --> 02:59:54.080]   that we could spawn life by bringing things there,
[02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:55.780]   as opposed to trying to take it, you know,
[02:59:55.780 --> 02:59:57.920]   figure out how to do it at a distance
[02:59:57.920 --> 02:59:59.980]   that it might not be amenable to life.
[02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:03.100]   You know, maybe creating a garden planet,
[03:00:03.100 --> 03:00:05.500]   maybe we don't put humans there right away,
[03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:07.580]   but trying to create a garden that could thrive
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:11.100]   at some appropriate distance from the sun
[03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:13.980]   and seeing what nutrients could be grown there.
[03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:16.700]   You know, so you could have robots man this planet,
[03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:19.860]   but you'd have to somehow aggregate stuff in space
[03:00:19.860 --> 03:00:22.140]   to build this planet or launch this planet up
[03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:23.420]   that it would collect things.
[03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:25.980]   I mean, that to me feels like a fun experiment
[03:00:25.980 --> 03:00:29.480]   and a lot less risky than going up to other planets.
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:31.880]   - Yeah, I was blessed as my first guest
[03:00:31.880 --> 03:00:33.200]   on the "Into the Impossible" podcast,
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:35.200]   that Freeman Dyson, you mentioned your dad,
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:36.720]   your dad mentioned him.
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:39.160]   One of the greatest intellects of the last 100 years,
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:40.680]   great physicist, and he had these ideas
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:44.120]   for these Dyson spheres, which would be energy harvesting.
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:46.600]   So the first, you know, ingredient that you need
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:50.960]   to construct the Huberman Planet Habitable Zone
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:54.560]   is to have energy, is harvest as much energy as possible
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:55.440]   from a star.
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:59.140]   So he basically conjectured a megastructure,
[03:00:59.140 --> 03:01:01.860]   an alien megastructure that could be observable
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:04.700]   by astronomers could detect these objects
[03:01:04.700 --> 03:01:06.480]   and some claim that we have,
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:08.380]   but those have always been refuted.
[03:01:08.380 --> 03:01:10.700]   And it would be basically surrounding a star,
[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:13.380]   capturing every photon worth of energy that came out of it
[03:01:13.380 --> 03:01:15.460]   and then converting that to mechanical energy.
[03:01:15.460 --> 03:01:17.560]   And then yes, and then once you have infinite energy,
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:18.980]   you can actually do fusion.
[03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:20.940]   You can make up whatever molecules you want.
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:23.100]   You could make up, you know, print 3D printing
[03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:25.600]   at the quark level on up basically.
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:27.800]   And so that was his, you know, conjecture
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:30.520]   of how super advanced aliens would behave.
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:33.080]   But again, we have no evidence for it, but it's fun.
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:34.880]   It's certainly fun to have the science fiction,
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:37.680]   you know, kind of, you know, a lot of interesting science,
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:40.040]   you know, originates from ideas and creativity
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:41.760]   that originates from science fiction.
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:43.080]   So yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:46.360]   - You and I could talk about the stars, the planets,
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:51.360]   optics, animals, life here on earth infinitely.
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:56.160]   This is what happens, folks, when two real nerds
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:58.840]   get together and wanna learn from one another.
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:02.600]   And I hope you delighted in this at least half as much
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:05.760]   as I did, those of you listening.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:08.380]   I mean, you occupy an incredible place.
[03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:10.920]   And I mean that, you know, like your intellectual place
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:13.400]   since you were a child is a remarkable place
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:19.440]   that most people, I think, don't occupy,
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:20.700]   not because they don't have the training,
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:22.960]   but because they just haven't put their mind
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:24.640]   on there on these questions.
[03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:26.480]   And I think one thing that is so clear
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:28.000]   is that through your podcast, your books,
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.720]   and certainly through the discussion today,
[03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:35.160]   you've placed us in the position of scientist
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:38.280]   to be able to ponder these really big questions
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:40.200]   about really big, really distant things.
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:43.120]   This is not typically the way that my brain functions.
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:46.160]   I think most people are more focused on things
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:49.520]   proximal to them and here on earth.
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:52.140]   But I'm so grateful that you did.
[03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:55.860]   And I'm so grateful that you continue to educate.
[03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:57.460]   We didn't even get to talk about,
[03:02:57.460 --> 03:02:58.500]   but I'll just mention that you've been
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:02.180]   a absolutely spectacular proponent
[03:03:02.180 --> 03:03:06.460]   for popular science education and the importance of that.
[03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:08.580]   I've been very inspired by you and your work.
[03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.420]   - Thank you.
[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:11.500]   - Very inspired by your story.
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:13.140]   Sure, because of some similarities
[03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:14.220]   and, you know, fathers and sons
[03:03:14.220 --> 03:03:16.260]   and the tribulations, et cetera, different,
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:17.900]   but some overlap there.
[03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:20.440]   But also just because of the way that you approach life.
[03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:23.120]   And it's very clear to me that as a person
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:25.000]   who's focused on things very, very far away,
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:28.680]   where apparently there's no observable life yet.
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:29.520]   - Not yet.
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.400]   - That you're also very grounded in this thing
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:35.480]   that we call daily life and the delight
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:38.440]   of exploration and asking questions.
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:42.120]   And if ever there was a call to arms
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:44.240]   for people to get outside and look at the stars,
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:45.960]   perhaps through a telescope or perhaps
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:49.020]   through the telescopes on the front of their skull.
[03:03:49.020 --> 03:03:50.900]   Certainly to do that and to think about
[03:03:50.900 --> 03:03:52.180]   some of what was discussed today,
[03:03:52.180 --> 03:03:54.420]   because I'm certainly enchanted
[03:03:54.420 --> 03:03:57.440]   and I know those listening and watching are as well.
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:00.420]   So thank you for everything you do.
[03:04:00.420 --> 03:04:03.380]   Keep doing it, come back, let's keep talking.
[03:04:03.380 --> 03:04:05.640]   We didn't talk about God and the universe
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:09.700]   and the origins of life, but we'll do that before long.
[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:12.180]   And Brian Keating, thanks for being you.
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:13.340]   I appreciate you.
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:14.180]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[03:04:14.180 --> 03:04:15.620]   You've been a big inspiration to me too.
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:17.540]   And use your language.
[03:04:17.540 --> 03:04:19.140]   Thank you for your interest in science.
[03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:21.020]   It's really done so much for the world
[03:04:21.020 --> 03:04:22.620]   and you give it all for free.
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:24.740]   And it's truly an inspiration.
[03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:26.820]   And it's really fun to talk to somebody
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:28.660]   who's at the level that you're at
[03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:31.540]   and so many different things and still has that.
[03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:32.860]   As scientists, we get inured,
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:34.500]   we get kind of used to things.
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:36.720]   Oh, there's a rainbow, there's a meteor, whatever.
[03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:38.000]   But you still have that passion.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:39.580]   You have that passion, that curiosity.
[03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:41.380]   And I think that's what makes a true scientist.
[03:04:41.380 --> 03:04:43.340]   And the function of education
[03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:44.620]   seems to beat that out of kids.
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:47.920]   But really to have that in the domain
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:50.100]   and the expertise that you have is a real inspiration.
[03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:51.820]   And I think it's a huge service to society.
[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:53.300]   So I wanna thank you too.
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:54.140]   - Thank you.
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.180]   Well, it's a labor of love mixed with an affliction.
[03:04:56.180 --> 03:04:57.620]   So we'll keep going.
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:58.620]   Right back at you.
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:04:59.460]   Thanks, Brian.
[03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:00.280]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[03:05:00.280 --> 03:05:02.060]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:05:02.060 --> 03:05:03.460]   with Dr. Brian Keating.
[03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:05.420]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:08.200]   and indeed fascinating as I did.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:09.980]   To learn more about Dr. Keating's work,
[03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:12.700]   his podcast, his book, and other resources,

[03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:37.800]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:39.660]   or topics or guests that you'd like me to consider
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:41.220]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:05:41.220 --> 03:05:43.700]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:05:43.700 --> 03:05:45.540]   I do read all the comments.
[03:05:45.540 --> 03:05:47.980]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:50.820]   I am HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:53.700]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:55.860]   Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[03:05:55.860 --> 03:05:57.220]   And on all those platforms,
[03:05:57.220 --> 03:05:59.380]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:05:59.380 --> 03:06:00.860]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:02.280]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:04.300]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:06:04.300 --> 03:06:05.740]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:09.220]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:06:09.220 --> 03:06:10.340]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:06:10.340 --> 03:06:11.540]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:06:11.540 --> 03:06:13.160]   It's my very first book.
[03:06:13.160 --> 03:06:14.580]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:06:14.580 --> 03:06:16.700]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:17.900]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:19.020]   for more than five years,
[03:06:19.020 --> 03:06:21.360]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:22.900]   of research and experience.
[03:06:22.900 --> 03:06:25.980]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[03:06:25.980 --> 03:06:28.460]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:06:28.460 --> 03:06:30.940]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:34.280]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:36.360]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:40.260]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:06:40.260 --> 03:06:42.620]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:44.400]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:06:44.400 --> 03:06:46.180]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:48.680]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:06:48.680 --> 03:06:50.140]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:51.940]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:06:51.940 --> 03:06:53.160]   the Neural Network newsletter
[03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:55.120]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:57.320]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[03:06:57.320 --> 03:06:58.500]   to what we call protocols
[03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:01.180]   in the form of brief one to three page PDFs
[03:07:01.180 --> 03:07:03.860]   that cover things like how to optimize your sleep,
[03:07:03.860 --> 03:07:05.540]   how to regulate your dopamine.
[03:07:05.540 --> 03:07:08.660]   We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure.
[03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:10.460]   Get a lot of questions about that.
[03:07:10.460 --> 03:07:12.460]   Deliberate heat exposure and on and on.
[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:14.520]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:16.460]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:18.560]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.660]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[03:07:20.660 --> 03:07:22.580]   And I should mention that we do not share
[03:07:22.580 --> 03:07:24.300]   your email with anybody.
[03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:25.620]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:28.180]   for today's discussion with Dr. Brian Keating.
[03:07:28.180 --> 03:07:30.460]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:07:30.460 --> 03:07:32.420]   thank you for your interest in science.
