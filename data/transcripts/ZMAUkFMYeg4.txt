[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, many factors in our lives condition us and influence how we approach God.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.200]   That's the case today in an email from an international listener to the podcast, a teenager.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.920]   I'm a 14-year-old and a rather new listener to the podcast.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.280]   I live in Southeast Asia.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.040]   I have a question about fear, specifically my fear of becoming close with God in the
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.440]   Bible and through prayer.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.120]   I find myself longing to be connected with God but constantly feeling repelled away from
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.120]   Him too.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.280]   I don't get the familial feelings that I should have.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.840]   I suspect it could be because of my relationship with my parents is bad.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.080]   My mother has been abusive in the past and I never knew my father until recently.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.480]   He is unstable.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.800]   My family is a real mess."
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.080]   How do you think family dysfunctions affect our relationship to God?
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.800]   So our young friend says, "I have a fear of becoming close to God.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.160]   I find myself longing to be connected with God but constantly feeling repelled.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.680]   I don't get the familial feelings I should have."
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.040]   And I take him to mean that he knows from the Bible that God is his Father and that
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.720]   he is God's Son, and yet as he attempts to draw near to God, this fatherly-family
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.040]   relation doesn't feel like it should.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.280]   It probably doesn't feel warm or welcoming or hopeful or safe.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   And he wonders whether such a paradox of being drawn to God and repelled by God might be
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.920]   owing to his earthly-family situation.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   So he asks, "How do you think family dysfunctions affect our relationship to God?"
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   So I'm going to make five brief observations from the Bible that I hope he will dig into
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.720]   for his own hope and stability.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:25.640]   Number one, get really clear in your mind and heart that the guilt of ungodly parents
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.480]   does not attach to godly children.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:41.120]   Ezekiel 18:20, "The soul who sins shall die; the son shall not suffer for the iniquity
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.560]   of the father."
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.600]   Now don't be confused when God says in Deuteronomy 5:9, "I, the Lord your God, am a jealous
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.500]   God visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720]   of those who hate me."
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.020]   What that means is that wherever the guilty sins of the fathers persist in the guilty
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.680]   sins of the sons, there will be a divine judgment.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   The key phrase is "those who hate me."
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.480]   Where the evil of the fathers finds an echo in the hatred of the sons, judgment will come.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.880]   So the wonderful truth for our young friend is that his mother's and father's guilt for
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.020]   sin does not cling to him or condemn him.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.780]   In Christ, he stands before God by his own faith.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.760]   He is accepted, loved, forgiven because of Christ, and his guilt is taken away.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.020]   That is crucial.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.540]   Now he has a place, a solid place, to stand as he faces these challenges.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:12.940]   Number two, consider the amazing biblical record of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles about wicked
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:22.500]   kings and failing kings of Judah who had sons who turned out to be good kings.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.700]   Asa did what was right, but his father Abijah was evil.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.660]   Uzziah did what was right, but his father Amaziah failed in his old age.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.780]   Hezekiah did what was right in his eyes, in God's eyes, but his father Ahaz was evil.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.900]   Josiah did what was right, but his father Ammon did evil.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:59.100]   In other words, the Bible witnesses to the fact that in God's world, many failed fathers
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.660]   have had righteous and useful sons.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.260]   In fact, Jesus said, "Do you think that I've come to give peace on earth?
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.620]   No, I tell you, but rather division.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.220]   Families will be divided, father against son, son against father."
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.020]   That's what believing will sometimes do in families.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.140]   Therefore don't be fatalistic.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.340]   Don't think, "Well, failed parenting always produces failed offspring, so there's no hope
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.340]   for me."
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.740]   No, that's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.420]   Number three, here's why that is.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.780]   Genealogical curses are broken in Christ.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.460]   Division and dysfunction may have ruined families for generations, so much so that people can
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   feel hopeless.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   We're just cursed.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.220]   I mean, I had people tell me this.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.860]   Somebody lost a child on New Year's Eve one time, and I went to visit them immediately
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.220]   while everybody was celebrating at church, and the father stopped me in the hall, and
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.500]   he just said, "Does God curse families?"
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.860]   So much problems come into one family.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.020]   We're just cursed.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.700]   There's no hope for us.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.780]   That's why everything goes wrong in our family.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.620]   The fathers—they would say something like this—"The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.660]   and the children's teeth are set on edge."
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.660]   That's Jeremiah.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.420]   And Jeremiah says, "Don't talk like that."
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.940]   That is not a—that's not the way Israel talks.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:41.900]   Jeremiah 31, 29—Christ is the great curse breaker because of what Paul said in Galatians
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.900]   3, 13.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.700]   "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us."
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:56.500]   Now, if Christ has set us free from the curse rendered by God in his law, how much more
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.900]   will he break every curse and every spell and every enchantment and every hex that may
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.980]   loom over your family for generations?
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.940]   So here's the mindset I think our young friends should have.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.300]   God has called me—14-year-old me—God has called me to himself in the midst of a
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.600]   cursed and broken and dysfunctional family.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   This is my time.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.300]   This is my calling.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.180]   He has raised me up to break this curse.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.300]   He has raised me up to free this family from generations of dysfunction from now on.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.180]   I belong to Jesus.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.260]   I have a perfect Father in heaven.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.500]   I will, by his power, build a new generation.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.340]   That's what I think his mindset should be.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:55.560]   Fourth, keep in mind that God assumes that all of us come to Christ with a defaced image
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.580]   of God and who he is and who Christ is.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.940]   In other words, don't think it's unusual that because of your distorted fathering or
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.060]   mothering or sonship that your view of God is distorted.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.540]   That's not unusual.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.180]   It's universal.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:22.000]   Sin has ruined everybody's view of God and self.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.660]   Everybody comes into Christ with a distorted, dysfunctional, demeaning view of God.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.620]   That's what sin has done.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.660]   We spend a lifetime trying to fix it, which means that all of us must experience in our
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:45.740]   mind and in our heart a massive revolution in the way we think about God in all of his
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.740]   roles.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.460]   All of us.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.880]   Some people have one distortion of God.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.800]   Some people have another.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.960]   And yes, our parents had something to do with that.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.040]   So did a lot of other things.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.720]   The process of sanctification for every Christian is this, 2 Corinthians 3.18, "Beholding
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:14.560]   the glory of the Lord, we are being changed into his likeness."
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:24.040]   In other words, every Christian needs to have a Bible bath for every thought in our head.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.840]   Every thought needs cleansing.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.720]   Every thought needs adjusting.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:35.600]   Paul says it happens by looking, looking, looking to Christ and to God in Christ.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.340]   So I say to our young friend, join all of us.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:47.920]   Join all of us and fix your eyes on the way the Bible describes God as your Father, God
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.600]   as your Shepherd, God as your King, God as your Friend.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   And don't think you are unusual because you must undergo such a revolution in your
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   thinking.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   You're not unusual.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   You're normal.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.080]   And then the last thing I would say, number five, is that most of us have been lamed.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.480]   I think I could say all of us, but I'll just leave it most, lest anybody stumble over absolute
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.160]   statements.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:22.000]   Most of us have been lamed by past experiences, deep experiences of shame.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.160]   I remember a few horrific experiences when I was a child of being shamed, not by my parents,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.120]   but others, or rejection or abuse or trauma of all kinds.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.420]   We should have a realistic view that some of these wounds are like Jacob's hip being
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.680]   put out of joint.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.920]   We will walk the rest of our lives with an emotional limp.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.320]   This doesn't mean we can't have a deep, satisfying, loving walk with our Heavenly
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.280]   Father through Jesus Christ.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.880]   It just means we should be realistic.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:10.280]   The healing of wounds can still leave scars, and even those, though they make us limp,
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.440]   can be turned to the glory of Christ.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   Man, there is a lot in those five responses to meditate on.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your wisdom, for your counsel.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.620]   I really appreciate it.
