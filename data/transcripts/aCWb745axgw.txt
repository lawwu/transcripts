[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:43.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.920]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.540]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.280]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.480]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.620]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.840]   dedicated to helping people make better financial decisions.

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.860]   Today, our discussion is all about international investing,
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.200]   and specifically, investing in international stock index
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.140]   funds.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.280]   We have two special guests, Christine Franklin,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   a principal and senior portfolio manager in the Vanguard Equity
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.620]   Index Group, and Michael Perry, also a principal and portfolio
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.980]   manager in the Vanguard Equity Index Group.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.700]   Christine's background is from trading.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700]   She was the first person hired by Vanguard
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.580]   to trade in the European markets in Europe.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.540]   Michael Perry has been with Vanguard for his entire career
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.460]   and has moved his way up to a senior position
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.020]   where he assists not only in the portfolio
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.060]   management of the index funds, but in the construction
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.740]   of the indexes themselves.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.820]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Christine Franklin
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.620]   and Michael Perry.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.340]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.700]   Thank you for having us.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.380]   Thank you.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.960]   Well, thank you for being on the show.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.780]   We have a lot to discuss today.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.980]   We all know that the international equity markets
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.420]   have not kept pace with the US markets over perhaps 15 years
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.940]   now, and emerging markets have not really given us
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300]   any return here in the United States
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.140]   for that period of time with the exception of perhaps dividends.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.260]   So we're going to talk a lot today
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.460]   about investing in international stocks.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.440]   And I believe it still is a good idea to do this
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.380]   and why Bogle Heads would want to continue to do this.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.620]   Before we get to that point, I do
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.500]   want to get to know you a little bit.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340]   So Christine, could you just give me a two-minute synopsis
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.300]   of how you got to the position you're at today?
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.800]   Sure.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.580]   So as you can hear, I'm not exactly raised in the US.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.860]   I have a nice French accent.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.420]   I'm from Belgium.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.500]   I've been at Vanguard about 20 years, so a little bit more
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.620]   than 20 years.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.380]   And I was hired by Vanguard to start the first trading
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.380]   desk outside of the US.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.620]   So when I got hired, I started working in the States
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.660]   for a year before they shipped me to Europe
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.580]   to start the first trading desk.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.940]   And the idea there was really to help Vanguard
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.580]   reduce transaction costs by having somebody on the ground
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.100]   to trade the stocks for the US shareholders.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.980]   So I did that for 10 years, created the trading desk
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.540]   in Europe.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.700]   And then about 10 years ago, I was
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.940]   asked to come to the US where we develop more global presence
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.560]   and really represent that global view in the US.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.420]   And I've been a portfolio manager here for, yeah,
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.020]   probably 10, 11 years now.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.100]   And you have your undergraduate degree
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.460]   that you received in Belgium.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.580]   And you have an MS in finance from Clark University.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.700]   And you have a law degree as well.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.260]   Yes, I did practice law for three years in Belgium
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.580]   before I came to the US.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.180]   And the main reason I actually came to the US at first
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.460]   was to improve my English because I
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.420]   couldn't speak English.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.260]   I speak Dutch and French.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.780]   And that's when Vanguard found me.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.740]   And they gave me the opportunity to do something
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.220]   I did nothing I could do, which is start to trade and be
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.140]   a portfolio manager.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.500]   So I took the opportunity, came to Malvern 20-some years ago.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.260]   I love the team.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.700]   I stayed ever since.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.220]   So I'm one of the rare person in the trading room
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.500]   that actually got hired in the trading room.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.100]   And I'm still in the same team working
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.620]   with the same people, which is really a treat and a pleasure.
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.280]   And Michael, could you tell us something about your background
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.140]   and how you ended up in the position
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.860]   that you're in as a portfolio manager?
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.100]   Vanguard is my first job out of college.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.100]   32 years ago, I started in our fund accounting area
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.700]   where I learned a lot of how the operations work--
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.980]   so trade settlements, pricing, cash movements, everything.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.380]   And I think the first impression that I had when I started
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.580]   was the culture.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.060]   Definitely, Jack had the culture of doing the right thing
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.580]   for investors and low cost.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.380]   And it kind of struck you when you
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.820]   went into the copier machine.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.340]   There was a little metal box at the top.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.500]   And you were expected to put a nickel in the box
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.400]   if you made personal copies.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.500]   And I don't think anyone monitored it,
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   but it was just a reminder that every penny counted.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.660]   Definitely was a focus to keep costs low.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.420]   I remember that Jack telling that story.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.660]   And others at Vanguard telling that same story.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.340]   It's true.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.620]   About 25 years ago or so, I got to the trading desk.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.220]   And I'd been working on both domestic US funds
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.300]   and then eventually moved over to work
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.780]   on our global portfolios.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.940]   I've been one of the portfolio managers
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.740]   on Total International since we went direct investment.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.500]   So before it was set up as a fund of funds,
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   and then we went direct.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.380]   So we've been there from the start.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.140]   And when was that?
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.020]   I recall that that all took place.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.100]   When was that, that it went from a fund of funds
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.180]   to a direct investment?
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.100]   In other words, you bought all the stocks in that fund as--
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.780]   I would say 15 years ago, because I wasn't receiving
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.460]   any of my trades.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.900]   We had used a couple of different underlying funds.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.300]   Europe, Pacific, and Emerging was the underlying.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.900]   One of the big things was we're missing Canada
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.820]   from our Total World Fund.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.620]   So we had a pretty good amount of Canada
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.180]   to buy in that transition.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.580]   So it took a bit of planning.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.980]   And over the years, we've had a few transitions
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.860]   like that with multiple funds, where the bottom line is we
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.060]   try and get into the names as cheaply as possible
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.180]   with the lowest cost possible.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.020]   So trading is definitely a focus for us
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.740]   in minimizing trading costs and transaction costs.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.180]   Vanguard has two Total International funds.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.300]   And we'll get into a little bit of the history of that
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.860]   in a minute.
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.240]   But before we go down that path, I
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.180]   want to go to a 30,000-foot level
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.940]   and look at the world equity market.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.980]   And the world equity market is about 60% US stocks
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.180]   and 40% international from a capitalization-weighted--
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.460]   not GDP, but capitalization-weighted.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.980]   Could you differentiate what makes a US company
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.380]   and what makes an international company?
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.980]   Is it just where the headquarters are located?
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.340]   How is this decided in an index?
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.300]   So it depends on the index.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.740]   They all have their own criteria.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.220]   For, say, FTSE and MSCI, they look at a few things.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.380]   They look at headquarters.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.060]   They look at primary listings.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.220]   And then they look at where the companies are incorporated.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.860]   So they really take into account several different factors
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.180]   when they're identifying where the country should be.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.860]   Is it safe to say that if you bought a total US stock market
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.500]   index fund and a Total International index funds
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.260]   that all of the securities are mutually exclusive,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.940]   that there's no overlap?
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.100]   Because there are two different index providers.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.500]   So I couldn't say 100%.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   But it's probably somewhere in the 99.9% range.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.220]   It's pretty standard where companies are classified.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.300]   There might be small differences between the indexes.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.420]   But for the most part, you're safe.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.860]   There's not any overlap.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.420]   So within the foreign market, which
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.740]   is also called the international market, which is also
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.740]   called the ex-US market, meaning excluding US,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.060]   we've got developed markets and emerging markets.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.940]   And how does that get differentiated
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.820]   among the index providers?
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.900]   So I'll take that one too, since I'm on the FTSE policy
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.140]   committee and was on their country classification
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.100]   committee for probably almost 10 years.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.460]   So FTSE has a list of criteria.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.700]   It's about 21 criteria.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.420]   Some of them are based on economic factors.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.220]   There's others that are based on market forces, transaction
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.380]   costs, liquidity.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.820]   There's a bunch of factors.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.300]   And if the country meets a certain number of factors,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.020]   they get put on a watch list.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.460]   And the committees will review the countries on the watch list
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.020]   and determine whether those countries have
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.380]   made significant progress in terms of trading.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.100]   And the actual committee will make a recommendation
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.980]   to FTSE in terms of whether it should
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.740]   be developed or emerging.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.140]   The people on that committee are from a few different spots.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.300]   So there's buy side.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.540]   There's investment companies like us.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.700]   There's brokers that are in all over the world that
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.100]   give their opinions.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.820]   There's custodial banks.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.020]   So you really have a lot of expertise
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.940]   that come together on a quarterly basis
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.380]   to talk about these countries on the watch list.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.220]   Now, for the most part, the indexes
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.700]   are pretty much in agreement with the countries.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.380]   There are a few differences, one of which is Korea.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.820]   So FTSE has Korea classified as developed.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.220]   MSCI has it classified as emerging markets.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.180]   It's kind of an interesting one, because economically, I
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.620]   don't think there's any argument that Korea is developed
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.140]   from all the metrics.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.860]   But certainly, operationally, there's
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.580]   some challenges to trading and some market frictions
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.100]   that make it trade more like an EM country.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.700]   So there can be slight differences like that.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.980]   Now, Korea is a pretty big one, so that's the major one.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.020]   But there's smaller ones, too.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.980]   But for most countries, they're aligned between the indexes.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.660]   And now let's talk about the two-ton gorilla
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.140]   in the room, which is China.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.180]   China is a big country.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.100]   They have a big economy.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.820]   But it doesn't seem to be a very large percentage
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:26.020]   of the international indices or the emerging market indices.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.580]   And why not?
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.260]   I also manage the emerging markets portfolio,
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.980]   so this is near and dear to my heart.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.300]   So China actually has listings not just in mainland China,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.260]   but they have listings in Hong Kong.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.540]   They have listings in the US.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.460]   They have listings in Singapore.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.700]   The names that are listed in mainland China
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.660]   are capped at 30% foreign ownership.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.980]   So all the indexes adjust for that foreign investment
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.180]   limitation.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.940]   And then on top of it, it's not fully included.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.460]   So for FTSE, they only have it at a 25% inclusion rate.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.140]   And for MSCI, it's 20%.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.980]   The reason is because there are frictions
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.740]   with the operations and the way the market trades that are
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.900]   different than other markets.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.140]   So I think the index providers want
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.980]   to see some improvements in terms
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.580]   of some of those frictions.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.820]   And then they'll continue to increase the weight down
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.900]   the road.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.540]   So aside from restrictions on weights with China, perhaps
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.060]   a few other countries, the international indices
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:40.820]   are, for the most part, what's available to trade, I assume,
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.940]   is a cap-weighted index, free-float capitalization
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.340]   weighted, which means the stocks that
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   are available for anyone to buy.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.740]   Is that a fair assessment?
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   That's a fair assessment.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.740]   Especially the free-float factor is probably
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.460]   a very key element in the international market.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.180]   So if you're looking on the US side,
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.820]   there's not a lot of companies that have a free-float factor
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.700]   that adjusts how much is available
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.180]   for external shareholders.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.740]   When in Europe, if I take where I come from,
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.700]   you have state-owning part of certain critical companies,
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.500]   the same thing being the emerging markets.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   So what's actually available for foreigners or even
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.100]   regular shareholders to buy is smaller.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.300]   So the index adjusts for that.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.020]   So that would be probably a much bigger component
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.980]   of the index composition on the international side
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.220]   if you compare that to US indices
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.100]   have less of those free-float factors playing a role.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.300]   So I just want to understand this.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.260]   So it's basically the indices that are used in the US
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.260]   are for what US investors can buy, not all that's available.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.340]   In other words, in China, they can only
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.540]   have a certain percentage that can be foreign investors.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.420]   So we can only invest a certain percentage as US investors
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.380]   directly in China's stock market.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.220]   But it could be much bigger than that.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.140]   I mean, the market itself is much bigger, correct?
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.940]   It's just the indices that we use and the index funds
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.420]   that we have limit us to just what
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.700]   is available to US investors.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.260]   Is that correct?
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.700]   It's not to US investors.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.100]   So if you're looking at the China situation,
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.260]   it's like the foreign room is how much is available
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.580]   for foreigners to buy.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.500]   So the index kind of cut it off.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.580]   And that's more an arbitrary cut-off, actually,
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.980]   that's what's truly available.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.700]   If you're looking free flow, it is truly
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.100]   looking at the ownership of any single company
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.820]   and taking out of that weighting,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.660]   like the market capitalization of the company, what's
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.940]   not available for sale.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.180]   So you have long-term cross-holdings.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.100]   So if you're looking in Japan, you have Toyota buys a lot
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.900]   of their suppliers.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.380]   They own 30% to 40% of the supplier's chain.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.020]   That's never going to be available for shareholders
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.820]   of any Japanese or US or any person in the world to buy.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.300]   So basically, what the index provider does,
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.380]   they reduce the market cap of the company
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.820]   from the full weight to what we call the free float weight.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.660]   Now, all of the indices are calculated
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.620]   in native currencies.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.500]   We don't have any currency hedging in the equity
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.220]   market, in the total international fund
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.620]   or the developed market fund or emerging market fund.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.420]   Unlike our bond funds that we get through Vanguard,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.340]   the equity funds are unhedged.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.380]   So basically, if you're looking, the purpose of currency hedging
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.620]   is truly to diminish volatility over time.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.660]   So over the course of the last few months,
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.540]   if you are European-based investors or US dollar-based
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.740]   investors, because of the way the currency has moved,
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.620]   you either made a lot of money or lost a lot of money
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.660]   just based on the currency movement.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.500]   But over time, that volatility kind of eases out.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.460]   So historically, the currency volatility
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.100]   over a period of 15, 20 years is really not a big element
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.940]   of your investment return.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.420]   So for equity, which is an asset class that's normally,
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.580]   by itself, already volatile, it doesn't
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.260]   feel like it's really necessary to start
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.460]   diminishing the volatility of returns
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.980]   by trying to reduce the volatility of currencies.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.380]   For the bonds, for which there's very little volatility
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.620]   in the investment returns themselves,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.620]   the volatility of the currency can actually
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.700]   wipe out all your return that you will have.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.460]   So for that, we offer currency hedging.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.460]   So it's really based on the volatility of the asset class
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.780]   that that decision is being made.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.460]   So at least the vanguard investors
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.100]   who are investing in the total international developed
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.460]   markets for emerging markets, it's an unhedged portfolio.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.940]   There's no currency hedging.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.940]   There's no currency hedging.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.140]   The foreign markets I looked at this year,
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.620]   and kind of doing about as well as the US equity market,
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.900]   but what I noticed was if you take out this currency
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.460]   devaluation of foreign currencies
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.020]   and the appreciation of the dollar,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.740]   that this year, international stocks
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.300]   in their native currencies, if they didn't have--
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   if they were hedged, international stocks
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.300]   would be outperforming.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.540]   By about 10%, they'd be outperforming the US,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.660]   even though they'd both be down.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.140]   It's because not only are the stocks down some
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.540]   internationally, but the strength of the dollar
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.100]   has pulled down foreign stocks to the point
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.360]   where they're about on par with the US market.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.060]   But I don't think a lot of people realize
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   that international stocks in their own native currencies
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.700]   are actually outperforming the US market.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.900]   I believe-- and correct me if I'm wrong--
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.260]   one of the reasons why international stocks would
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.500]   have outperformed US stocks, if it wasn't for this currency
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.420]   difference with the strong dollar,
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.660]   is because of the structure of the industry groups
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.060]   in the international markets.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.580]   They tend to be very different and have very different weightings
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.140]   than the US market, which tends to be heavy health
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.580]   care and heavy technology.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.940]   So in your experience, can you tell us
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.540]   how the different weightings of industry groups between US
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.420]   and international does affect this difference in return
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.580]   and has affected the difference in return,
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.980]   say, over the last 10 years?
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.180]   It's basic theory in terms of pricing.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.140]   So if you have cash flows that are in the future,
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.580]   you get in an area where there's rising interest rates,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.780]   and you discount those future cash flows,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.020]   industries like technology probably
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:51.140]   don't expect to generate profits until far in the future.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.700]   So a lot of those companies are going
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.740]   to be more impacted in a period of raising interest rates,
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.060]   where if you look at foreign companies,
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.940]   there's a lot more financials.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.540]   And a lot of the financials have maybe
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.660]   cash flows that are more short-term in nature.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.220]   You're more likely to have dividend payments
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.540]   so that the interest rate rise wouldn't
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.380]   affect those types of companies as much
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.220]   as the technology companies.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.820]   That could be a reason why an index with more financials
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.540]   is doing better once you strip out currency
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.100]   than technology indexes.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.060]   You also have more basic materials.
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.340]   You have more energy.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.780]   You have more industrials in the international markets
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.300]   than you have on the US market.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.100]   So if you're looking at where we are from an energy perspective
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.820]   with the war in Ukraine and everything,
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.660]   so that has a tendency to probably have
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.500]   prospect of bringing short-term returns that
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.220]   are higher than in the technology
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.580]   sector for the reason that Mike explained.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.380]   I did a compare on the Vanguard website,
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.220]   and I compared the Vanguard Total International Stock
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.860]   Fund to the Vanguard Total US Stock Fund.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.620]   And when you do that, it gives you a lot of information.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.220]   One set of information is this industry sectors.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.780]   And the big ones, it seems to be,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.980]   internationally, have a much bigger allocation
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.460]   to materials, financial services, industrials, energy,
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.460]   and a much lower allocation to health care and technology.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.660]   So when you see these industry groups rotating around,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.420]   this seems to be a good environment
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.660]   or has been a good environment for the more commodity-driven
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.540]   sector and financial-driven sector of the market, which
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.020]   would have normally caused international stocks
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.580]   to outperform if not for the fact that the US
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.840]   dollar has been strong.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.420]   Now, the other thing that's interesting about the compare
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.900]   function on Vanguard and looking at these two funds side
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.620]   by side are the vast differences in valuations
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.100]   between price-to-earnings ratios,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.460]   price-to-book ratios, earnings growth rates.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.780]   And let me just go over them.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.060]   The PE, price-to-earnings ratio, this
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.820]   is based on September 30th data.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:25.460]   The total US stock market fund was about 17 times earnings.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.300]   It was only 10 times earnings in the Vanguard Total
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.740]   International.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.420]   The price-to-book in the US market
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.180]   was about three times book.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.900]   It was half that in the international fund,
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.540]   the Total International.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.820]   And the earnings growth rate in the US was around 20%.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.260]   It was about half that internationally.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.960]   So I always look at the international market
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.340]   and say, if I ever wanted to buy a value index
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.820]   without buying a value index, all I have to do
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   is buy international stocks.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.380]   Certainly, our investment strategy group
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.980]   is in agreement with your premise.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.900]   So they definitely see that over the next 10 years,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.640]   there's probably an opportunity for international stocks
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.500]   to have better returns than US stocks,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.460]   primarily for the reasons that you said.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.620]   PE ratios are much less.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.660]   Price-to-book is much less.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.700]   We just had currency moves, pretty substantial currency
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.340]   moves in the last few years where the dollar strengthened.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.500]   So I think our investment strategy group
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.660]   is in agreement that there's probably
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:43.140]   more opportunity for equity-like returns
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.180]   in international equities than US equity.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.200]   Historically, if you go back 30 years
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.860]   and you look at the PE ratios and price-to-forward earnings
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.500]   and so forth, emerging markets in particular
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.540]   are about the lowest they've been.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.220]   And developed markets are getting pretty darn low also.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.060]   So it really is an interesting--
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.560]   not to make a prediction about what's
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.500]   going to happen in the future, but just
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.660]   from a valuation standpoint, if there's
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.500]   any kind of a regression to the mean
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.420]   just for emerging market stocks and international stocks
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.900]   just to regress back to, say, 14 times earnings or something,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.400]   which is sort of the middle of the road of where they normally
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.620]   trade at, 14 to 15.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.620]   I mean, it does seem to me that if you're not
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.180]   in international equities, that it
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.740]   might be a good idea to diversify into them.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.980]   And if you are in international equities,
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.540]   well, certainly don't make a decision based on the last 10
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.920]   years to get out.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.340]   I also want to point out one more
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.740]   thing about international equities
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.060]   for people who need dividends.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.500]   Gosh, I mean, I think the Vanguard Total International
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.140]   Index Fund right now is yielding about 4%.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.460]   True, is that correct?
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.060]   Yes.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:58.220]   So I definitely had looked at that recently, and that is true.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.060]   It's 4%.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.180]   Well, that's a phenomenal yield.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.100]   If you're going to just-- if you believe that--
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.780]   even if the economy goes into a recession
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.660]   or the global economy goes into a recession,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.240]   there might be some cuts in dividends.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.060]   But still, if you get that cash flow for a retiree,
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:20.760]   and it is not a bad cash flow in their portfolio.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.340]   I do want to mention, though, something
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.620]   having to do with the dividend.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.140]   And we'll talk about this at a very high 30,000-foot level.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.940]   But if you have international stock index
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.700]   funds in your taxable account, you
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.420]   don't get the full dividend.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.040]   Some of the countries actually hold back
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.080]   a portion of the dividend that's paid to you as a US investor.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.400]   They hold it back in the form of a tax.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.280]   And the way that we get this money back
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.760]   is through a foreign tax credit that we take on our taxes.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.280]   Now, this is only available to people
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.000]   who have international funds in their taxable portfolio.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.880]   But can you talk a little bit about the foreign tax credit
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.320]   and how that works?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.920]   So really, at the fund level, we get what you described.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.140]   So tax in the fund itself.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.480]   Granted, we have a great tax team at Vanguard.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.860]   So there's a lot of treaties with the different countries
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.420]   that allow us to get back some of that taxation.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.700]   So our tax team is really involved
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.580]   with all the different tax authorities across the globe
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.460]   to get as much back as we can based on those treaties
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.740]   that have been signed by the US government.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   So that's the first step of trying to prevent paying taxes
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.500]   is really having an engaged team that
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.260]   work with the custodian across the globe to get that back.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.580]   When you're in a taxable account,
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.220]   you get a nice report from Vanguard
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.100]   at the end of every year that actually shows you
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.060]   how much of that tax that you pay
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.180]   that you can create from your US taxation.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.340]   So that's how it works.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.580]   I just want to make one caveat.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.100]   A lot of people talk about putting the World Equity
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.060]   Fund in their taxable portfolio.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.380]   But there is a little quirk in the IRS tax code--
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.460]   and again, I'm not a tax expert either--
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.660]   that says that unless the fund is more than 50%
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.100]   international, then you don't get this tax credit.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.940]   So you wouldn't want to put the World Equity
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.400]   Fund in your taxable portfolio.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.580]   You'd want to split it between the US Total Stock Index
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.500]   Fund and the Total International so you could get the tax credit
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.220]   from the international fund.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.500]   So I wish I could say that you have the same tax
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.940]   advantage in Total World as you have in Total International.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.020]   But it's different just because Total World
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.460]   has 60% of its asset invested in US security.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.940]   So we don't get the tax credit back through Total World.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.460]   So you're probably, from a tax perspective,
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.340]   better off choosing to use Total Stock and Total International
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.700]   to get the same exposure.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.740]   Thank you for validating that.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.420]   So now I'm going to talk a little bit more
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.220]   about these indices from various providers.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.260]   The index providers have different ways of doing things.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.500]   For instance, you're following two different FTSE indices
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.340]   for two of your different Total International Stock Index
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.580]   funds.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.260]   The Bingard Total International Stock ETF
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:22.180]   follows the FTSE Global All Cap Ex-US Index,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:29.620]   which has 7,991 constituents or names in it or companies in it.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.380]   But then you also have another Total International Fund
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.020]   called the FTSE All World Ex-US.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:44.780]   And that follows the FTSE All World Ex-US Index.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.740]   So tell me what the difference is, please,
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.620]   between VXUS and VEU.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:58.220]   I mean, the word "all cap" is in VXUS, and it's not in VEU.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.180]   So please explain that.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.460]   So Global All Cap, VXUS, is exactly that.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.180]   It's all cap.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.620]   So it's large caps, mid caps, and small caps.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.020]   And it represents close to 100% of the market cap
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.340]   available in the world, ex-US.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:23.260]   The FTSE All World is just large and mid caps.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.620]   There are no small caps in the FTSE All World.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.100]   The way that FTSE separates large, mid, and small
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.460]   is they try and take the top 86% of the universe,
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.020]   and they make that large and mid.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.540]   Now, there's buffers so that names
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.700]   don't move between mid cap and small cap
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.380]   and helps reduce the turnover for investors.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.260]   But in general, you can assume that FTSE All World is
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.580]   primarily large and mid and does not have small caps in there.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.660]   OK, this is interesting because I also
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.060]   looked at your competitor, iShares,
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:13.740]   and they follow the MSCI ACWY Ex-US IMI Index.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.780]   That has 4,300 names in it.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.540]   And then Fidelity has a Total International Fund,
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:27.300]   and they follow the MSCI ACWY Ex-US Investable Market Index.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.380]   That has 5,045 names in it.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.940]   Fidelity also has the Fidelity Zero Fund, Total International.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.340]   They call it, but it only has 2,458 names.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.860]   So even though all of these funds
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.060]   are called Total International, really,
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.540]   the only true Total International Index Fund out
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:53.860]   there is the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.060]   with the ticker VXUS, which has about 8,000.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.900]   And all of the rest of them have at least 3,000 less.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.060]   So if you really, really want a true Total International Index
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.860]   fund, it seems like you would go with the Vanguard Total
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.700]   International Stock Fund or ETF.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.280]   Yeah, so the difference is methodology.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.820]   And the methodology is that FTSE actually
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.620]   has more names in the index, because their cutoff
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.380]   to get into the index in terms of size
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.660]   is lower than what MSCI has.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.020]   So it's lower because what FTSE does
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.220]   is they look at companies by region,
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.420]   rather than MSCI looks at it by developed and emerging,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.420]   and then cuts across and says, this
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.140]   is the minimum market cap that we'll accept in our index.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.820]   So the result is FTSE's thresholds for index entry
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.500]   are a lot smaller in terms of market cap
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.140]   than a lot of the other global markets.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.420]   You have companies that are $100 million to $200 million
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.780]   market cap in terms of size, where MSCI cuts it off
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.500]   at about roughly $300 million.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.860]   And it seems that even though the correlations
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.380]   between these funds are 0.99, or the R-squared is 99,
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.260]   it's very, very, very close, that in fact,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.580]   there are these very, very, very minor differences.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.860]   I looked at the 10-year performance,
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.940]   the Vanguard FTSE All World XUS and the Vanguard Total
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.820]   International Stock ETF over a 10-year period of time,
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.940]   ending in September 30th.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:45.820]   And the Vanguard FTSE All World XUS ETF compounded at 3.32%,
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.420]   and the Vanguard Total International Stock
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.060]   Fund compounded at 3.34%.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.260]   So I don't know if there's much difference between these two.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.780]   But if you're going to--
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.940]   the market's down this year.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.780]   If you own the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.500]   and you want to take a tax loss, you could sell that stock fund
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.780]   and you could buy the FTSE All World XUS.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.340]   It is a different index.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.180]   It is a different fund.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.180]   It has a different QCIP.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.500]   So in my view, it's not substantially identical.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.740]   But again, we're not tax experts here.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.460]   But the performance is very close.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.180]   And all of these funds, the performance is very close.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.060]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.580]   I think methodology across all of the indexes
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.260]   conformed over the years.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.060]   So everyone has load adjusted.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.180]   Everything's based on market cap.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.140]   Very similar methodologies in terms
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:39.340]   of when to include IPOs or secondary offerings.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.900]   So it doesn't surprise me that the returns
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.820]   have been pretty similar.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.500]   Well, I want to get into how you do your jobs now.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.260]   I mean, you're in the US.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.780]   You're trying to come up with an NAV at the end of the day
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.820]   for the Opened End Fund.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.180]   The ETF is trading in the US during our normal business
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.580]   hours, but all of these markets are closed.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.460]   So how do you do that?
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.940]   I mean, you get money into the fund.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.060]   You have to put it to work.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.260]   You tell me on a day-to-day basis,
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.180]   it's much harder to manage these international stock funds
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.140]   when the markets are closed.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   How do you do that?
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.740]   European market closed around 11.30 AM.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.980]   So after 11.30 AM, basically, the only thing
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.540]   that's really investable is Canada and Latam,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.940]   which is a very small portion of that portfolio.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.820]   So if we get any cash flow, what we will go,
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.940]   we will revert to the futures market, which
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.540]   is trading all the way to 4 PM New York time.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.580]   So we will invest what we are receiving in the future market
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.740]   and then create trading days for the following day
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.660]   where we can invest, basically, in the local market.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.500]   So we will do a switch from futures to equities.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.700]   As those markets open, we will send trades, actually,
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.180]   across the globe, which I was one of the first ones
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.300]   they sent trades to.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.620]   But that's why we have that presence across the globe.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.940]   We have presence in London.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.500]   We have presence in Melbourne, in Australia.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.260]   And we actually ask those traders that
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.900]   are really part of our team, they're an extension of us,
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.260]   to look at the future position, look at the equities,
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.300]   and help us transform that future risk into equity risk
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.460]   and make sure that the investment is done smoothly.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.980]   So they understand the market.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.500]   They know how to trade.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.740]   They know how to source liquidity.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.460]   They really are our partners into the management
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   of the funds as they're trading.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.340]   Yeah, just to confirm what Christine said,
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.620]   we rely on the local expertise of our trading desk.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.340]   We have one in the UK, one in Australia.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.180]   They've become experts in those markets.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.460]   So they are trying to save as much cost
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.140]   as we can for the ultimate investor.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.460]   We're constantly evaluating the tools
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.980]   that we use to access those markets.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.660]   We're using the ones that perform better.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.220]   There's an evaluation process.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.700]   We have a transaction cost team that
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.140]   looks at all of our trades on a regular basis
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.940]   and gives us feedback--
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.380]   not just us, but the other regions--
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.540]   about what tools that we use perform the best.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.660]   We continue to use the ones that work the best more so.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.620]   So transaction costs are huge.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.220]   And it's like saving that nickel in the copier machine.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.300]   We're trying to add the same costs around the edges.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.460]   And ultimately, it means better returns for our investors.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.900]   Michael, could you elaborate on transaction costs?
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.820]   Here in the US, we've gotten to the point
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.540]   where it seems to be almost a de minimis
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.340]   amount for mostly mid-cap and large-cap stocks.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.180]   But that's not true with a lot of emerging markets
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.620]   and even some developed markets.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.220]   Can you kind of give us an overview
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.060]   of how much it costs to trade in various countries
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.420]   and which ones are expensive, which ones are not?
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.660]   And how expensive is it for a vanguard
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.740]   total international fund investor
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.900]   to hold the fund from a transaction standpoint?
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.260]   So in terms of commissions, commission rates
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.300]   we get in the US are very, very low.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.220]   And the spreads in the market are very tight.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.100]   When you go overseas, some markets trade well.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.980]   But others do not.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.700]   So if we trade in Latin America and we're
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.740]   trading a mid-cap or a small-cap name in Mexico or Brazil,
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.620]   the spreads are going to be wider.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.060]   The costs to settle the trades are
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.900]   going to be significantly more.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.900]   And the commissions that we pay to the broker
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.820]   will be significantly more.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.900]   So as a portfolio manager, we try and balance those costs
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.380]   when we go to trade.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.620]   I always say that trading is a minus.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.060]   It's a net cost.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.020]   So what we try and do is reduce that cost.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.260]   And we have some techniques.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.660]   We have some optimizations where maybe we don't
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.580]   buy every name in the index.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.980]   We just buy a sample that will allow us to track the index.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.260]   And then the next time we run a list,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.180]   it may be a different set of names.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.380]   But we'll be able to track the index
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:18.100]   and, at the same time, reduce those fixed costs and spread
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.020]   costs in trading.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.340]   And if I can add to that, so when
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.220]   I look at how I started at Vanguard,
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.940]   that was basically my role when I was sent to Europe
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.220]   to create the trading desk, is to find ways
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.220]   to save all shareholders money by improving our execution
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.740]   costs.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.940]   So really, by having a person on the ground,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.860]   you get a good feeling of what is a fair price to pay.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.460]   You don't pay overcharges for that.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.140]   And then you can really, truly look
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.580]   at ways to optimize that spread cost that you have to pay.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.220]   Because you know how to source liquidity,
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.780]   who to call, how to use--
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.860]   we have crossing networks.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.820]   We have closing mechanism.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.420]   You interact with the market.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.580]   So those are things that we get engaged with.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.900]   We are active and engaging with both regulators and exchanges
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.580]   to make trading in those foreign markets
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.460]   better and less costly for investors.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.860]   So we're on a lot of industry panels.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.420]   We're on the index committees.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.900]   We're engaging directly with exchanges
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.180]   to try and advocate for our shareholders
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.860]   and make things better.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.740]   Can you talk a little bit about proxy voting?
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.860]   I know that you don't do proxy voting yourself.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.540]   But how is it done in foreign equities?
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:41.660]   And do they do it the same way in South Korea or the Philippines
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.900]   that they do in the United States?
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.020]   We, our team-- so the team that's
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.900]   managed out of Maverick, but has presence in, actually,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:53.660]   Australia and in the UK as well, vote every proxy voting.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.020]   So basically, they have a team that research
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.260]   what the best option is in the proxy voting
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.860]   for the long-term investor.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.820]   So that approach has not changed.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.420]   It's the same across the globe.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.500]   So if you're familiar to what we do for US stocks,
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.460]   we basically do the same thing across the globe.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.020]   It's more time intensive, because it's
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.980]   in different languages.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.140]   And you rely on the custodian to translate the documentation.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.780]   But the research and the attention
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.980]   to what is the right vote is the same.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.740]   We don't necessarily vote in line
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.700]   with the big companies that recommend how to vote.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.500]   We have our own team and our own analysis.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.660]   And sometimes, we engage directly with the company.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.940]   So we have a team in London that have
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.060]   a huge amount of engagement with companies directly,
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.420]   where they set up the board.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.980]   They talk about what Vanguard values are
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.140]   and how we think about long-term value for shareholders
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   in that sense.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.100]   And they're truly engaged.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.740]   And to be honest, we also engage with certain governments.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.460]   Like last week, I was talking to a government
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.580]   in a European country for the same reason.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.540]   They have questions around proxy voting
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.180]   and how we really want to have a voice for shareholders
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.340]   in their interest.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.980]   I want to turn now to the ETF and open-end mutual fund.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.900]   And at Vanguard, it's a little bit different.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.900]   You've got an ETF as a share class of the open-end fund.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.020]   But the interesting thing about ETFs
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.460]   is that they trade during the day.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.380]   The foreign ETFs that are covering
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.420]   the total international fund, the emerging market fund,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.820]   the developed market fund, these ETFs
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.540]   are trading during the day.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.780]   Do they trade close to where these futures trade
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.900]   that you were talking about?
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.740]   I mean, when you go to price the NAV of the open-end fund
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:46.260]   at the end of the day, does the ETF pricing--
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.860]   is that any kind of a price discovery vehicle
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.180]   that you're using to help determine
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.380]   what the price of the open-end NAV
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.140]   is at the end of the day, which would be the price
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.660]   that open-end fund shareholders would transact
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.700]   with?
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.180]   Sure.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.540]   ETFs are a great proxy.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.980]   At least the ones that trade and have significant volume
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.540]   are a good indication of where a market should be priced.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.340]   So if Taiwan is closed and we need
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.500]   to look at where we should price that market,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.860]   they can look at a lot of different factors.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.620]   They can look at ADRs that trade in this country.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.740]   They can look at ETFs, whoever's ETF it is that trades.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.220]   And it's a decent approximation, because the people that
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.860]   are making markets in those products
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:42.140]   want to actually set bid and offers that are fair.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.460]   So they wouldn't want to set an offer that was maybe too low,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.540]   because people could potentially take advantage of it.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:57.740]   So ETFs are a pretty good proxy for what we call fair value.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.700]   I want to stay on ETFs for just one more minute,
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:03.300]   because a lot of investors do use ETFs.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.500]   And when they go to put the order in to buy an ETF
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.180]   or to sell an ETF, if they're putting it
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:14.340]   in in the middle of a trading day for VXUS or VEU,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.380]   generally the spread between the bid and the ask
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.220]   is maybe one penny.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.460]   So it's very tight.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.220]   And we've been told that you should put in limit orders
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.820]   on what you--
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.980]   when you're buying, you should put in a limit
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.340]   on how much you're willing to pay for this ETF shares.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.900]   And when you're selling, you should put in a limit
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.020]   on how much you should take when you sell your shares.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.620]   But it seems to me there is so much liquidity.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.620]   The pool of liquidity in VXUS and VEU
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:54.140]   is so large that even when we put in fairly sizable orders,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.780]   you get pricing.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.300]   Often, when you're trying to buy,
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.380]   you get pricing even at the bid price.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.660]   And when you're trying to sell, you
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.060]   get the better ask price, which is flip-flopped.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.460]   But could you comment on that?
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.300]   Because it seems to be very good pricing just
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.980]   by putting in market orders, even though we're told
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.420]   by the ETF experts out there that you shouldn't
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.940]   put in market orders.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.500]   I think it depends on the size of your order.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.140]   So if you have a really small order, you're safe.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.940]   You're safe going market.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.300]   If you have a larger order, it probably
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.260]   warrants using a limit order.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.300]   So for the regular retail investor
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.860]   that's trading less than 100 shares, or 100 shares,
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.540]   or 200 shares, you're probably fine.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.580]   If you're trading a block or 1,000 shares,
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.340]   maybe be a little more careful with setting limit orders.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.760]   Problem with setting limit orders
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.420]   is you subject yourself to something
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.620]   called adverse selection.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.140]   So if you're on the bid side and the market drops,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.380]   you're probably more likely to get
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.440]   done if it goes through you.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.020]   So that's not great execution.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.380]   So I'm with you.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.980]   I think small orders--
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.260]   I think people are fine putting market.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.180]   I think it's the larger orders, you want to use limit orders.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.660]   I've had some very large investors
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.380]   who have purchased $10 million.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.820]   I mean, these are retail investors
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.340]   who have a lot of liquidity after selling
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.580]   a business and so forth.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:31.380]   And they're buying $10 million of VXUS at a time.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.580]   I recommend that they call Vanguard to do this.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.100]   Is that something that you recommend also?
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.780]   We do have a capital markets area
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:45.780]   that deals with institutional investors or investors of size.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.980]   Basically, there are market makers in the market
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.660]   that our capital markets team will
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.900]   work with to set up what a fair bid offer
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.020]   price would be in the market.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.660]   So you may have one of the market makers
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.060]   make a price if it's that kind of size.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.700]   And we also know who holds liquidity.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.340]   So we know from a market maker, like the authorized
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.420]   participant point of view, which is basically
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.900]   the people transacting in the second market
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.740]   and really transacting directly with us,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.020]   we know who owns an inventory of those shares.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.780]   So I can tell you certain brokers that are big names
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.580]   hold a lot of shares of VT.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.580]   I could tell you if it's VT or VA,
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.660]   I know exactly who I will send you to.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.500]   Just because of our interaction with them,
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.140]   we know they have a tendency to interact
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.900]   with what we call the primary market, which
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.940]   is directly with us by the exchange of shares in kind.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.540]   So we could guide you to people we know can make a market
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.260]   for you in that ETF.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.780]   So that's not a bad call at all, because we have that knowledge.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.260]   Well, let's break it down then.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.220]   If you're going to do less than 1,000 shares,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.380]   then it's probably OK to put in a market order.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.140]   If you do it during the middle of the day,
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.340]   not at the beginning of the opening or at the close,
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.020]   but in the middle of the day when things are trading,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.420]   then you're probably going to get good pricing.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.940]   You really don't have to worry about putting in limit orders.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.820]   But if you're going to put in more than 1,000,
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.180]   then you might want to try a limit order and see.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.500]   But again, sometimes it's difficult.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.660]   Like you said, Michael, the market's moving against you.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.660]   You could end up paying more.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.020]   But at some point, you're going to want
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:30.100]   to contact the market desk at Vanguard
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.340]   and have them do the trade for you.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.260]   Would you say that that would be like a 10,000 share
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.860]   order or more?
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.420]   What do you suggest?
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.260]   So I'm not sure what the exact dollar amount.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.700]   I think it's more institutional size,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.420]   so maybe larger than, say, 10,000 shares.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.140]   Yeah, I don't think we-- we don't really
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.260]   trade our own ETFs, because we have restrictions in place.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.780]   So I think we are not.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.380]   OK, no, that's fine.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.000]   But it is some much larger amount.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.380]   And I think if you're going to do a big trade like that,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.780]   a trillion-dollar trade, that you
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.820]   would be able to contact Vanguard directly on that.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.140]   And they would help you out.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.060]   That's if you're custodying at Vanguard.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.540]   If you're custodying somewhere else,
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.500]   you would have to contact the broker that you're working with.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.860]   If you had a crystal ball--
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.300]   and I know we don't--
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.140]   in closing, tell me your thoughts
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.980]   about the future of emerging markets
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.740]   and the future of developed markets.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.740]   What do you think?
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.460]   Well, I can tell you what makes us different
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.740]   than other index desks.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.980]   I think we have a little bit more flexibility
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.100]   as portfolio managers, because we are also the traders, too.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:42.620]   So we can identify opportunities in the market that can save
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.320]   costs better than other places.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.220]   Normally, the setup is portfolio manager
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.340]   gives a trade to a trading desk.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.260]   And the trading desk is incentivized,
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   one, to get the order done, and two,
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.460]   not to get done in a way that they would be questioned.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.580]   For us, since we are the portfolio manager
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.300]   and the trader, it gives us a little more leeway
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.700]   in terms of figuring out how to save costs.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.340]   For example, last week, there was a share increase
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.880]   in a UK stock.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.140]   The deal had closed where they were buying a US company.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.580]   And we were able to buy the exposure of the UK name
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.340]   in the form of a US stock and actually bought it
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.180]   3% cheaper.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.380]   Now, we have risk areas that keep us in line so
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.180]   that we don't take undue risk.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.740]   But it's examples like that where
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.940]   we have a little bit more flexibility than other shops.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.900]   And we are constantly fighting for every last nickel that's
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:48.620]   in the market, because we know ultimately
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.100]   our objective is to get the best returns for our shareholders,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:56.420]   give them the best chance for investment success.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.580]   I have to say that when looking at the performance of all
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.300]   the different international equity index
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.940]   funds that are the total funds, broad market funds,
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.620]   this way you trade and the low fee that you have,
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.820]   but more probably the way you trade,
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.100]   actually does come out in the performance.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.540]   I see that over a few years compounded
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:23.660]   that Vanguard always seems to be ahead by maybe 0.1%,
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.820]   sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.900]   But in the long term, this ability
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.900]   to trade better and get better pricing
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.380]   does show up in the performance, which
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:39.260]   is why I tend to prefer personally the Vanguard total
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.300]   market ETFs.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.540]   But at times when I'm doing tax loss harvesting
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.200]   and things are moving quickly and need
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.780]   to move around between different international index funds,
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.860]   would move out into something else.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.540]   But I appreciate very much what you do at Vanguard for all
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.460]   of us, and Christine, do you have anything else you'd
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.660]   like to say before we close?
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.940]   The European markets close around lunchtime.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.340]   I was trading European markets here in the US,
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.260]   and the entire trading desk went for lunch.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.020]   So I was the only person standing there.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.980]   Mr. Vogel came through the door, like,
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.500]   how are the markets doing?
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.780]   And I was so taken by what I was trading,
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.180]   because it's like the peak time for my work,
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.220]   that I started rambling through what the London Stock
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.660]   Exchange was doing, what the Euronext Exchange was doing,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.100]   France and Germany, and just trying really
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.820]   to articulate the vision of what all the European markets were
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.420]   doing, because I was proud of it.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.340]   And it's Mr. Vogel and sitting right there,
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.780]   and I'm just very, very young.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.820]   And I remember his puzzled look looking at me like,
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.460]   what is she talking about?
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.100]   Yeah, Mr. Vogel doesn't believe in international investing.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.740]   So you were way, way off track.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:52.900]   Yeah, Jack Vogel had two things that he stuck with.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.780]   And number one was, why do you need international stock?
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.780]   We sell product overseas.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.740]   We get our exposure that way.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.220]   That was one of his viewpoints.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.020]   And the other one was how he hated exchange-traded funds.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.380]   So if you're a international fund manager who's
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.620]   trading the Vanguard ETFs, I mean,
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.220]   you're not on his Christmas list.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.580]   Sorry.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.980]   Mr. Vogel liked us.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.940]   He would come in every once in a while
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.780]   to talk to us during the day.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.060]   And it was a great kind of experience
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.980]   to have him come by and say hello.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.740]   And he was that type of person.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.980]   He would go over to the cafeteria
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.780]   and have his peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.540]   And he would hold open court to anyone
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.660]   who wanted to sit down and chat with him.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.540]   He really was a people person and loved the crew here.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.900]   So he's missed, no doubt.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.740]   Well, thank you so much for both of you
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.780]   for joining us today on Vogel Heads On Investing.
