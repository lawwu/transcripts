[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.160]   in the chapter that we read at the beginning, namely the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.200]   in verses 7 and 8.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.640]   And the Lord said, "I will destroy men whom I have created from the face of the earth,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000]   both men and beasts, and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240]   me that I have made them."
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.240]   It is my intention really to deal with this great and important incident, the account
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.240]   of which in part is found here in this sixth chapter of this book of Genesis.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.680]   I want, I say, to look at the incident as a whole in order that we may learn the great
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.240]   message, the vitally important message which it has to teach us.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.360]   What is the cause of the trouble?
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.360]   And the second question is, what can be done about it?
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.600]   Now mankind is very concerned about this problem, at least those who think at all are, and I
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.680]   think the majority do.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.420]   But unfortunately, they keep their eyes on a certain level only, and they refuse to consider
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.000]   the message of this book.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.200]   The Bible is a book that comes to speak to us about life itself.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.240]   It is because they fail to realize that the people are not interested in it.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.800]   Religion is regarded as a kind of subject, a matter of interest for people who are moved
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   and drawn in that direction.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.600]   I remember once attending a conference, not in this country nor in this continent, but
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.640]   in another continent.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.480]   I attended a conference where I was asked to be the chaplain for the week, and I found
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.640]   that in the almost endless list of subjects that they claimed to teach and to deal with
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   in that conference, religion was item number sixteen.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.400]   There are many who think of it, I say, in that way.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.360]   They came there to study literature, they came there to study art, they came there to
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   study music.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.880]   Well, there were still a few people left who wanted to study religion, and the others,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.640]   of course, were not interested.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.040]   Now there are many, I say, who take that view, that it's one of these theoretical matters.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.280]   You can take it up, if you like, as a hobby.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.680]   People have all sorts and kinds of hobbies, and this is one of them.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   And the view that is taken is that the number who are interested in that way is becoming
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360]   smaller year by year.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.680]   But there are still some.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.280]   But for the vast majority, this, of course, is outdated, outmoded, it's got nothing to
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240]   say, it's completely irrelevant.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.840]   Well, now, we are starting from this basis, that not only is this book relevant, but that
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   finally it alone is relevant.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.960]   We've been spending five Sunday evenings before this on the third chapter of this book
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.760]   of Genesis.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.360]   And our whole object there was to show that you rarely don't begin even to understand
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.080]   the nature of the problem of the modern world until you accept the message of the third
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.320]   chapter of Genesis.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.680]   For there, and there alone, is the real explanation.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.640]   Try all the other explanations, if you like, and you'll find every one of them to be
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   inadequate.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.040]   Here is an explanation that really fits the facts.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.920]   Man is as he is, and the world is as it is, because of man's disobedience of God.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.600]   It's man's rebellion against God.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's man setting himself up as the authority and spurning the voice divine.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.760]   That led to some terrible consequences immediately.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   We've been considering them.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.040]   The consequences are still with us.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.400]   It's an accurate description of life today.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.760]   Very well, there it is.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:51.040]   Man has brought his misery upon himself, and he's in a state of helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.960]   He put himself deliberately, voluntarily, under the dominion of his arch enemy, and
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   the arch enemy of God, the devil, Satan, the God of this world, the prince of the power
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   of the air.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.800]   That's what man did, and he's remained in that bondage ever since.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.840]   And he can do nothing about it.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.600]   He's tried throughout the centuries, but he's never succeeded.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.880]   He never will.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.440]   But thank God it's just there, the message of this book comes in, that in spite of all
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.640]   this, God is still concerned.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   The God who looked at Adam and Eve after they had sinned and had fallen, and who came down
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.960]   into the garden to speak to them, is still the same God.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.720]   That's the message of this book.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.600]   He came down, you remember.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   He pronounced judgment upon them and their sin.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.160]   He showed them the consequences that had to follow, but he didn't stop at that.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.900]   He offered them a program.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.040]   He showed them a way out.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.480]   He was going to introduce a way of salvation.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.160]   He's going to set enmity, he says, between the seed of the woman and the seed of the
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   serpent.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.000]   There's going to be a mighty warfare in which the serpent's head is going to be bruised
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and the seed of the woman is going to receive a wound in his heel.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   Now that's the whole essence of the Christian gospel, and we found it there, way back in
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.280]   the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.640]   But that's only the beginning.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.320]   The Bible doesn't end at the third chapter of Genesis.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.400]   It goes on, and we've got this mighty volume.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.360]   What's it all about?
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.040]   Well, it's just further history.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.580]   It is, as I tried to show in a hurried summary a week tonight, it's the account of the outworking
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.760]   of this plan of God.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.680]   It's just the subsequent record of what God has proceeded and has continued to do with
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.720]   men and women.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.960]   And here we come in this sixth chapter of Genesis to another remarkable incident.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.640]   After what we've been considering, there seems to be an interval in which God appeared to
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.360]   be doing very little.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.200]   God seemed to have left men to himself.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.920]   He allowed men to go on living in his own way, as it were.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.160]   There wasn't very much direct intervention.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.040]   It went on like that for large numbers of years.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.280]   But then suddenly comes this incident.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.960]   God's intervening again.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.540]   God's going to do something again.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.400]   The God who came down into the garden is again addressing men.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.320]   He's again speaking.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.000]   Now I want to try to show you this evening that that is the pattern of God's dealing
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.680]   with mankind ever since the fall of men.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.320]   And it's vital, it seems to me, that we should be clear about this, because, as I'm suggesting,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.160]   it is the only way to understand history.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.440]   You see, the Bible is a book of history.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.880]   That's what makes it so practical.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.480]   It does record the actual history of individual men, of nations.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.200]   It shows you the thing in detail, and especially in this light, how God was overruling it all,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.360]   how God was bringing things to pass.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.560]   In other words, you cannot really understand the history of the world in which you live
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.860]   unless you accept the teaching of this book.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.780]   And it's continued right away along, and you can't even understand the history of mankind
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.860]   and of the world since the end of the Bible, in other words, since the end of the New Testament
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:50.680]   canon until tonight, unless you accept the great principles that are laid down here.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:58.500]   God has got a method of dealing with men, and it is still the same method.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.760]   Here we are meeting on an armistice Sunday, and we are thinking about wars.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.920]   We have had two of them in this century.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.160]   We have gone through a terrible and a trying period.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.800]   And still the whole situation is problematical and uncertain.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.760]   And the question we all are asking is, "Why are things like this?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.160]   Why must they be like this?
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.220]   What is the matter?
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.720]   What can be done about it?"
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.640]   Now I say, "You are familiar with the other answers.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.280]   We get them put before us in the newspapers and in the journals day by day and week by
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.680]   week and month by month and in the quarterlies.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   There it is.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   We are familiar with it all.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.400]   I ask you, are you satisfied with what they are saying?
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.320]   Does it seem a sufficient answer?
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.440]   Does it hold out any hope for you?"
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.880]   Well I am asking you to consider tonight this message from God.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.400]   It is not my message.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   It is not my theory.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.000]   I do not come here to give you the result of my deliberations and cogitations.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.280]   No, no.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.000]   I try in simplicity to expound this book, this message.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.040]   It is my only authority.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   I know nothing about God ultimately apart from what this tells me.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.480]   I believe that I can deduce God from nature and creation.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.800]   I happen to believe these proofs of the being and the existence of God, but they are not
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.680]   enough for me.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   I cannot arrive at any knowledge of the character of God from creation.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:42.120]   I can, as Paul reminds the Romans, discover something about his eternal power and creatorship,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.920]   but I will never get to know him that way.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.500]   That brings me to an unknown God.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.720]   But if I am to understand history and myself and to have any hope, I must come to know
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   God, and I have no knowledge of God apart from that which I find in this book, where
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:06.360]   God has been pleased to reveal himself, his character, his person, his purposes, his ideas,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   his activities.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.680]   It is all here, given in words, given through prophets.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   He sent his own son to do it.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.880]   That is the message.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   You see this book is all about life and all about the world as it is at this minute.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.440]   Here then I say we come across this pattern.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:37.120]   God seems to leave the world alone and to itself for long periods, and then he makes
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.380]   himself manifest.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.820]   He does something.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.480]   He intervenes.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   He speaks.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.080]   He does things.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.960]   And the Bible is the record of all that.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.760]   Now here we have got one illustration and example of all that this evening in this sixth
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.240]   chapter of this book of Genesis.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.680]   The message is, I say, that God is still the same, that though he may appear to be silent,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.920]   he is still there, and his purpose is still sure and absolutely certain.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.720]   He makes it particularly clear at these critical periods, but it is there all the same at the
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.100]   other times.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.200]   The critical periods are there to call attention to it.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:28.560]   They are the signposts that God himself sets up, and he does it in his love and in his
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.680]   compassion.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:39.620]   For we are all very dull, and we all are so ready to forget that God has to remind us
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.000]   in a forcible manner.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   He has to indicate and point the way.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.440]   So here we have these tremendous incidents like the flood, the destruction of Sodom and
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:57.000]   Gomorrah, the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, the captivity of Babylon, certain climactic
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.120]   events.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.160]   They stand out in this record, in this history.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.880]   They are all, in a sense, exactly the same.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.800]   They all have the same message.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.560]   They teach exactly the same thing.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:18.160]   Yet nothing is more important for us than that we should learn the lesson which they
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.120]   bring to us.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:27.280]   Now then, what is the lesson of the flood?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.640]   I am not going to detain you tonight to argue with you as to whether this is history or
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   not.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.880]   I believe it is.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.280]   And I can give you my reasons and my arguments.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.640]   I am familiar with everything that has been said against it.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   I have read it.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.080]   I have considered it.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.680]   I nevertheless assert that this is history.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:02.080]   And if I had no other reason for asserting that, let me just give you one.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.600]   I would believe that this is history were it merely for the fact that the Lord Jesus
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.560]   Christ himself said it was history.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   He referred to it.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.400]   I am going to remind you of his teaching in a minute.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.880]   So that if you reject this as history, well then, you are left with the problem of the
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.960]   person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:35.720]   So you reject this as history at that particular peril.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.520]   You see, you cannot play fast and loose with these early chapters of Genesis.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.920]   It is not quite as simple as some people seem to think.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.320]   They say, of course, we no longer believe that.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.120]   Science has proved this and that.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.680]   Science of course has proved nothing.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.520]   What they really mean is that certain scientists have said so and so, which is a very different
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   thing.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.320]   And that is pure theory and supposition.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.960]   They cannot prove anything at all with regard to whether this is history or not.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.140]   I say, what they do not realize is this.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.560]   You cannot hold on to Jesus Christ and the gospel if you reject this because he believed
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.960]   this literal history.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:19.520]   And the whole of this salvation which the Bible has to offer is historical.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.620]   You cannot reject the facts, the history.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.720]   It is not an immaterial question therefore as to whether this is history or any of the
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.240]   other illustrations.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.120]   It is as material as it is to know that Jesus of Nazareth was born of a virgin, that he
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:40.040]   did literally work miracles, that he died and was buried but literally rose again in
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   the body.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.160]   The facts are absolutely vital.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.840]   They are essential.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.380]   I have no gospel apart from these facts.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.800]   And the Bible makes a great deal of them.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.960]   It tells us about the scoffers who laugh at them and who say, "Where is the promise
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.120]   of his coming?" and so on.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.760]   Well, let us go on then and see what this has to teach us.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.160]   Fortunately, we are not left to ourselves with this matter.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.960]   There are several references to this question of the flood in the New Testament, as I have
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.760]   just been saying.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.160]   Our Lord himself referred to it on one occasion.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.320]   You will find it recorded in the Gospels.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.960]   Take for instance the account in the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke,
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.640]   where our Lord said this.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.760]   He said, "Even as they were in the days of Noah, eating and drinking, marrying and
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:42.640]   giving in marriage, and knew not until the flood came and carried them all away, even
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:50.880]   so shall they be in the days of the Son of Man, eating and drinking, marrying and giving
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   in marriage still."
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.960]   That is one reference.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.800]   But then there is a reference to all this in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   the Hebrews, in that great gallery of the saints of the Old Testament we read, "By
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen, as yet moved with fear, prepared
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:20.120]   an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.920]   the righteousness which is by faith."
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.960]   There is another.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.920]   And then you will find another reference to it in the first epistle of Peter in the third
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:38.720]   chapter, where we are told that the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified in the flesh but raised
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.160]   in the Spirit, in which also we are told he went and preached to the spirits that are
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.120]   in prison, that disobeyed in the time of Noah at the flood.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.960]   And then he goes on to compare the Christian salvation to the ark that saved Noah and his
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   family.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.440]   There is another reference to it.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.680]   And there is a final reference to it in the second epistle of Peter in the third chapter,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.480]   where the apostle takes up this whole question of the scoffers who are then saying, "Where
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.160]   is the promise of the coming of the Lord?
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.320]   You have preached to us, they say, and you have told us that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.200]   coming back to judge the world.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.720]   Well, where is he?
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.040]   Years are passing and he does not seem to come.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   Ha, they said, you cannot frighten us.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.640]   We do not believe that kind of teaching.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   Where is the promise?
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.440]   Ah, says Peter, wait a minute."
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.120]   They were like that, he says, in the days of the flood.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   When Noah preached to them, they laughed at him and ridiculed him.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.880]   They scorned him, but the flood came.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.240]   And then he goes on to say, "Yes, it is coming.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.360]   The judgment is coming.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.280]   It will not be a flood the next time.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   God promised at the beginning.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.200]   He would never drown the world again.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.080]   He has given a sign of that in the rainbow, in the heavens.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.120]   But though he will never drown the earth, he will deal with sin.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.680]   There will be a judgment.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.200]   The elements shall burn and melt with fervent heat."
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   There is that final cataclysm to come.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   Now then, you see, in the light of all these comments in the New Testament, we can go back
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.560]   to this ancient history and consider its message.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   What is it?
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.120]   Well, I would divide it like this.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   There is a general message and a particular message.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.920]   I am not going to stay with the general, but I must note it in passing.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   Here is the first statement.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   "All calamities are due to sin.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.240]   God made the world perfect.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.360]   He placed men in paradise."
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.520]   And if men had obeyed, it would have continued like that.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.800]   There would never have been a calamity.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.640]   There would never have been a war.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:05.800]   There would never have been anything to disturb the even tenor of their ways and their enjoyment
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.680]   of life and of God.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.760]   Calamities have come in as the result of sin.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.320]   Are we all clear about that, I wonder?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.400]   Why are there such things as war?
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.840]   Is there anything more idiotic, more insane, more mad, more futile, more harmful to the
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840]   lot of men?
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.560]   War always leads to endless trouble in every respect.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.440]   Well, where has it all come from?
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   It is a calamity.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.880]   Where has it come from?
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.080]   The Bible tells you that it has come from sin.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:58.360]   It was as the result of this entry of sin that Cain became jealous of his brother Abel
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.720]   and decided to murder him and to kill him.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   That is it.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   That is the thing.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.080]   And it is still with us, isn't it?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.760]   It is with us in all the relationships of life.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.680]   And it leads to calamity.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   All calamity is the result of sin.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.240]   It would never have come but for sin.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:28.640]   A second principle that seems to me equally clear is this, that God sometimes brings the
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.720]   calamity upon men as a punishment of sin.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.260]   That is the whole message of this incident of the flood.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.320]   It is God himself who decides to do this.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:49.720]   He says, "And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth."
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.640]   God deliberately decided and determined to do so because of the conditions which prevailed.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:02.840]   Now, here is an important point, a very important principle.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.000]   God does not always do that.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.120]   As I have said, there seem to be long epochs and periods, sometimes apparently lasting
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.800]   for millennia and more, when God seems to tolerate things, allows them to take their
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.920]   course, does not seem to do anything about them, so that the scoffers say, "Where is
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.240]   your God?
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.600]   Can your God do anything?
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.400]   If he can, why does he not do it?
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.560]   You say he is almighty, but look, we have forgotten him, we have ignored him, we have
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.080]   lived our own lives, nothing happens to us, everything is going well, and God seems to
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   be silent."
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:45.920]   Yes, you see, as the psalmist puts it somewhere, "Thou thoughtest that God was just such another
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.640]   as thyself."
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.120]   You do not understand his ways, we do not understand it.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   God's ways are not our ways, neither his thoughts, our thoughts.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.880]   They are high as the heavens are above the earth, higher than our understanding, but
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   he gives it, he gives us the teaching, we have got the revelation, and it seems to me
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:11.840]   to be this, that God seems to allow things to go on like that until they reach a certain
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   climax, and when they do, God acts.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.400]   That is what he did here.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.440]   We read a statement like this later on in this same book of Genesis, that God says he
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   is not going to do anything until the iniquity of the Amorites is full or is fulfilled, then
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.640]   he is going to act.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.440]   You remember God's patience with the city of Nineveh, to which he sent the prophet Jonah.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.800]   He had waited, he had postponed, he had appealed, they did nothing.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.160]   He allowed the time to pass, but then he acted in his own time.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.480]   And of course, that is the great lesson of the Old Testament about the children of Israel.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.160]   God had given them his laws, and he told them that if they obeyed him, that he would bless
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.880]   them, but that if they disobeyed him, he would punish them.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.800]   Well, the children of Israel began to sin and to disobey, and they thought something
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.200]   was going to happen at once, but it did not happen.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.880]   Ah, they said, it is all right.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.240]   And on they went in sin, and God sent a messenger to warn them, they paid no attention.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.800]   They continued in sin, another messenger still, they paid no attention.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.640]   And at last they said, it is all right, we can settle down upon our lees, it is all right,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.720]   let us be at ease in Zion, nothing will ever go wrong with us.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   Then suddenly God acted.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   That is the message.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.000]   That is the whole history of this Old Testament.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.600]   And it comes to a terrifying climax in A.D. 70, in the destruction of Jerusalem and the
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.960]   casting out of the nation of Israel and its people amongst the nations of the world.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:51.640]   Now then, there I say is the principle, that though God does not always act at once, he
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.040]   will act, but in his own time.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:03.280]   And then the third general principle is this one, that every one of these individual single
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:14.440]   calamities in history is nothing but a picture of the final calamity.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   Every one of them is designed to reveal that.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:26.000]   Every one of them points on, this is not my theory again, it is the teaching of the Bible
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.760]   itself.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:39.320]   What is proclaimed is this, that God will punish sin.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:47.200]   I am sorry my friends, but I say again, I am not here to say what I like or what I think.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:57.840]   This is the whole message of the Bible, that God is just and holy and righteous and pure.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.040]   And God will punish sin.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.080]   I do not hesitate with reverence to put it like this.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.520]   God must punish sin.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.680]   He cannot deny himself.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.800]   He cannot go back on his own nature and on his own character.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   And God and sin are eternal incompatibilities, so God pronounces that he must punish it,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   and punish it he will.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.160]   And he will punish it in the individual.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.440]   He will punish it in groups.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.360]   He will punish the whole world in sin.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.920]   That is the general message.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:46.240]   Let me say something about the particular.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.920]   Why does God punish sin?
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.200]   Well the answer is God punishes sin because what it leads to, what it produces.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.240]   You notice that here God pronounces that he is going to punish the world and he is going
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.920]   to destroy that ancient world.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Why?
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   Well here is the answer in the fifth verse.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:12.280]   "God saw that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that every imagination of
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.760]   the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   That is why God did it.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:27.360]   That is the thing that always produces the punishment of God.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.840]   He saw that the wickedness of the earth was great.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.440]   Don't misunderstand me my friends.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:45.040]   I am not standing here in this pulpit tonight to suggest to you or to teach that I believe
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.400]   that what we have got here in the sixth chapter of Genesis is an exact description of the
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.680]   world today.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.200]   It may be, it may be.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.160]   God knows the world is much too much like this at this present moment.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.520]   I am not standing here to say that the end of the world is at hand.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.600]   It may be.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.000]   I can't say it isn't.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.560]   I can't say it is.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.240]   I am not to understand the times and the seasons.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.920]   All I know is that there is going to be an end and I find this principle in the scripture
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:23.160]   that God tolerates iniquity, I say, until it reaches a certain climax and then he does
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   things.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.520]   I simply ask you to face the evidence seriously and soberly.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:39.160]   It was when God saw that the wickedness of men was great in the earth that he did this.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:45.560]   He saw also that every thought of the imagination of men's heart was only evil continually,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:52.960]   which means this, that men and women not only did things that were wrong, they delighted
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.400]   in them, they burst into them.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:05.000]   It wasn't merely in practice, it was in the heart, in the imagination, in the mind.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.320]   You know there are times in the history of the world when men have been evil in practice
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.200]   but they don't seem to have been devilish in their minds to the extent that they have
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.760]   been at other times.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:23.520]   And at this time, as someone once put it, the world had reached a new low in iniquity.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.080]   Their very minds were fiendish.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.200]   They perverted all their powers and faculties simply to gloat and to revel in sin.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.640]   Their literature, as it were, became vile.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   Have you noticed what is happening to modern literature?
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.960]   There is always sin in the world.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.480]   There was a great deal of sin in the world a hundred years ago, in the Victorian period.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.040]   People then committed acts of sin.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   There was drunkenness, there was immorality.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.400]   Yes, but I think you will all agree there was a striking difference between the world
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.840]   then and the world now.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:14.280]   When you look into the realm of the mind and the imagination, don't you see the difference?
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.640]   Take it, for instance, in the matter of novels.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.440]   Have you noticed the striking difference between Victorian novels and the twentieth century
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   novels?
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.840]   You had not all that psychoanalysis and all that filth then.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.960]   A novel was more romantic.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:37.920]   But something new has come in, the imagination, the mind, the thinking, the heart.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   Everything is going down.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   Music is debased.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.640]   It is becoming primitive and suggestive.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.280]   It is no longer clean as it was.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.600]   Everything is perverted and twisted.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.920]   It is happening in literature.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.200]   It is happening in art.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.920]   Compare the art of a hundred years ago with that of today.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.800]   What is this new thing that has come in?
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.000]   Isn't it the imagination and the mind and the heart that are becoming evil continually?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.480]   That is the sort of thing that happened at the time of the flood.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.200]   Iniquity and evil and wickedness and vice were rampant.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.600]   Well, let me go on to what we are told in the eleventh verse.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:20.440]   There I read something like this, "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:37.360]   was filled with violence, corrupt, polluted, foul and tarnished."
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.280]   It doesn't take much imagination to see what it means, does it?
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.320]   You will get a description of the same thing in the second half of Paul's first chapter
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.720]   of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.000]   There have been other times it was like that at Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   Corrupt, sunk low and full of violence, you notice, which refers not only to murder and
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:11.440]   theft and robbery with violence, but people being attacked innocently, violence in the
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.800]   manifestation of lust and passion and such ideas, this violent element.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.640]   I ask again, isn't this far too much in evidence in this modern world?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.280]   The world is much more violent than it was fifty years ago.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.760]   There has always been violence, but not in this sense, not in this widespread sense.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.960]   The whole of life is becoming loud and harsh and cruel and angry.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.040]   There is a violence about men.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   He doesn't fight as he used to.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.440]   He must have some mighty bomb now that will kill thousands, perhaps millions at a time.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Violence!
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   Here it is.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.240]   There it was.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.680]   But you see, the trouble with it all is that it is before God.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.960]   The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.320]   This is the essence of sin.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.000]   It was all happening before God, but the world ignored God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.840]   It says there is no God, and if there is a God, well, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   He can't do anything.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   He is quite helpless.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.960]   He hasn't got any power at all.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.520]   And they lived like that under the very eye of God, and they went on doing it with God
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.320]   looking down upon them.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:37.120]   And they didn't believe that, and they didn't know that.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.520]   Those are the conditions in which God acts.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.800]   Those are the kind of conditions that lead to calamities.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.680]   It is when the world is like that that everything goes wrong, and men and women are alarmed
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:58.160]   and terrified and begin to ask, "What's going to happen next?"
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.840]   But let us not forget that when our Lord spoke about the time before the flood, what he said
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.600]   about it was this.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:13.680]   Where they were, he said, marrying and giving, eating and drinking, planting and sowing,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:23.640]   marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until the flood came.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   You see what he is describing?
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.280]   A purely materialistic outlook.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.320]   Eating and drinking, planting and sowing, exactly.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.520]   Marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.240]   This is the only life, this is the only world.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.840]   Very well then, let's get the maximum out of it, let's live for it entirely.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:52.280]   Don't talk about God, don't talk about eternity, don't talk about death, don't talk about judgment.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.800]   Just live for the present, doesn't matter what's happening.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:08.440]   Eating and drinking, planting and sowing, enjoyments, happiness, that's the thing,
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   isn't it?
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.080]   And it's the order of the day today.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.840]   They were like that before the flood, says our Lord, and that's why God visited them.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.400]   They were living purely on the earthly level.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.160]   They only thought of themselves, and they lived for themselves.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.120]   That's what they wanted, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   Let's get more money that we may be able to do it.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.120]   Then let's have our enjoyments, doesn't matter what happens.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.040]   Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.560]   Let us eat, drink and be merry.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:46.600]   I'm not applying this to the age in which we live, I'm leaving that to you.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.960]   I cannot but note the terrible and terrifying parallel.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:59.760]   The apparent utter concern of men and women, in spite of what we've already experienced.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.960]   Wouldn't you have thought on general principles that two world wars would have sobered mankind?
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.800]   That they would have forced men to stop and say, "Well, no, we can't go on like this,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.680]   there must be something wrong somewhere.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   Where is it?"
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.760]   But are they doing that?
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   Do the wireless and the television programs suggest that they're doing it?
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.360]   It's only just over ten years since the last world war ended, with a terrible and horrifying
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.080]   atomic bomb.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.960]   And yet men and women tonight are thinking above everything else about eating and drinking
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.680]   and having their supposed good time, and laughing at the jokes of the comedians.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.320]   How funny it all is.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.880]   Things are going well, let's enjoy ourselves.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.320]   The money's coming in.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   People are warning us.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   What's a warning?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   Why listen to that?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.760]   Why be a spoilsport?
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.080]   Let's carry on eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, planting and sowing.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.880]   It's the same mentality.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.320]   Precisely the same.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.400]   Well, those, I say, are the conditions which lead God to action.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.720]   And then God, having seen all this, he warns, he speaks.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.280]   Listen to what he said.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.240]   God said, "My spirit shall not always strive with men, for that he is also flesh.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.840]   Yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years."
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   What's it mean?
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:26.760]   Well, that's God's warning to men in this condition.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:34.000]   That is God saying to men, "Look here, I'm not going to restrain you much longer.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.400]   I'm not going to tolerate this much longer."
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   He says, "I'll give you another hundred and twenty years, and then, unless you've repented,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   I'll act."
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:50.360]   The narrative of the record puts it in what's called an anthropomorphism, which means this,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:55.000]   that when God speaks to us, he's in a way that we can understand.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.480]   So he says, "It hath repented me."
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.520]   God doesn't repent.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.160]   God doesn't change his mind.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   Why the term?
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.120]   Well, he wants us to understand it.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.480]   This is his way of pronouncing judgment.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.680]   He expresses his opinion on men.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:13.640]   He expresses abhorrence and detestation of their living.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:21.120]   So God warns, and God always warns.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.840]   He warns us individually, as he warns the whole world.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.320]   You've got that within you which is called the conscience, and it warns you every time.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.000]   When you're confronted by temptation, it speaks, it warns.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.800]   You've never sinned without being warned, never.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.560]   You've been told of the consequences, and yet you did it.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:49.240]   God always warns before he strikes.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:55.440]   The Bible is nothing but a great book of warning.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.800]   It's a warning to the individual, I say, and it's a warning to the whole world that this
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:07.600]   righteous God is going to judge us one by one and judge the whole world in righteousness
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:14.240]   by that man whom he hath appointed his own Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:20.120]   Beloved friend, have you heard the word of warning?
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.760]   Are you happy to go on living as you are and to ignore this message?
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:37.800]   May I quietly remind you this evening, our midstest day, which reminds us of our mortality,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.520]   which reminds us of death and the brief span which we spend of our existence in this world.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   My dear friend, you are going out of this world.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   Where are you going?
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.520]   To what are you going?
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.280]   God I say warns you.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.560]   He warns you in the record of the flood.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.880]   He warns you in the whole teaching.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:04.700]   You've got to stand before him and he'll judge you in righteousness.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:11.360]   He warned these people.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.480]   And in warning he called them to repentance.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.360]   He told Noah to build that ark.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:24.560]   It was a tremendous enterprise and it took Noah about 120 years to build it.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.800]   And there he began and people said, "What are you doing men?"
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   And he said, "God is going to judge the world unless we all repent.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:39.680]   He's going to drown the world and he has told me to build an ark to save myself and my family."
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   And they thought it was the funniest joke they'd ever heard.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.040]   Monstrous.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.760]   And they came back to him in ten years time and they said, "Do you still believe that,
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   Noah?
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   Ten years have gone, nothing's happened.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:59.200]   On they went twenty, thirty, forty, hundred, hundred and ten, hundred and nineteen.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.880]   It's really very amusing, isn't it?"
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.680]   Noah preached to them by building the ark.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.640]   He preached to them in words.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.840]   He is described in the second chapter of the second epistle of Peter in the fifth verse
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   as a preacher of righteousness.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.360]   I've already quoted you what Peter says in his first epistle in the third chapter.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:28.560]   He says Christ himself in the Spirit was preaching through Noah to those people before the flood.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.820]   Noah warned them.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.920]   He said, "God has spoken to me.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.440]   God is going to destroy the world unless you repent.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.840]   Repent, believe him."
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.080]   He did repent himself.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   He did believe.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.080]   He built the ark.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.640]   He carried it out in detail.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.580]   Thus did Noah according to all that God commended him.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.580]   So did he.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.320]   But the rest didn't.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.520]   Noah was a preacher of righteousness and he called them to repentance.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:59.800]   The flood is a warning and it comes to a day.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.780]   But alas, these people paid no heed and gave no attention.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:16.680]   They went on eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, planting and sowing,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.800]   and knew not.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.340]   They just went on as if nothing were happening.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.060]   They couldn't see the signs.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.360]   They didn't believe Noah.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.520]   They took no notice of the ark.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:37.220]   And as I've already reminded you, it's the thing that alarms and terrifies my soul to
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:46.500]   observe that these two horrible wars which we've endured have not even sobered people.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.740]   They seem to have made no difference at all.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.220]   The world is giving itself to pleasure more than ever.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.100]   Never has this country been so self-satisfied.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.940]   It's resting on its knees.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.340]   It's folding its arms.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.300]   It's having a marvelous boom.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.460]   We're in a time of great prosperity.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:11.380]   We must have our pleasures, whether we can afford them or not.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.340]   We'll buy them on a higher purchase system, though we can't afford it.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.600]   We must have it.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   We must enjoy it.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.060]   Eating, drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.940]   All the warnings ignored.
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:29.140]   All the vice of God spurned.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.900]   But God carried out his judgment.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:39.460]   Eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not, says the Son of God
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:49.900]   himself, until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:58.380]   The fact that you and I may ignore the warnings of God will make no difference to God's plan.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:05.620]   The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:14.740]   A thousand years with God are but as one day, and one day as a thousand years.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.460]   He seems to be asleep.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:24.940]   Vast epochs pass and God does nothing, and the world says he cannot do anything.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:30.380]   But as the flood came, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:36.140]   The children of Israel were conquered by their enemies, carried away captive.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.740]   Eventually their city was destroyed and they were thrown out amongst the nations, I say.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.860]   God is just warning us in all these things, and I believe he's warning us in this twentieth
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:52.140]   century by the state of the world, by the calamity of wars.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.540]   He's allowed all this for us to see.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:05.820]   He's reminding us of the final judgment, which cannot be evaded, which no man will be able
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:15.060]   to abide, the coming of Christ to judge the world in righteousness, which is as certain
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:22.260]   as the flood, as certain as the birth of Christ as a babe in Bethlehem, as certain as the
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.260]   resurrection.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.420]   It's coming, it must come, it will come.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:33.420]   It's God's pledged word that says it.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.540]   And there is only one way of escape.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.900]   It's here in the eighth verse.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.980]   Listen, that's why I read verses seven and eight to you.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.780]   And the Lord said, "I will destroy men whom I have created from the face of the earth,
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.780]   both men and beasts and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.540]   me that I have made men."
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:46:03.060]   But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord and was not overwhelmed in the calamity, but
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:08.260]   was delivered and was made safe.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.220]   He found grace.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   Why?
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.180]   Well, the answer is given in the ninth verse.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:23.660]   We read this, "Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.300]   That's the secret.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:32.900]   The one thing that marked this man out from all the rest was simply this, that he believed
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.560]   the word of God, nothing else.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:40.120]   God came to him and spoke to him and Noah believed him.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.420]   That is why he is described as a preacher of righteousness.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:49.200]   That's why the eleventh chapter of Hebrews says that he became the heir of the righteousness
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.700]   which is by faith.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.120]   It wasn't even his character that saved him.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.640]   It was that he walked with God, which meant this, that he allowed God to lead him, that
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.940]   he went where God went, that he listened to God, he said yes to God.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.200]   God spoke and Noah said, "I believe."
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.800]   That is what saved him.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   And as the apostle Peter tells us, "As that ark saved Noah from the waters of the flood,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:28.020]   even so belief in the Lord Jesus Christ and being in him saves from the wrath to come
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.020]   at the final day of judgment of the whole world."
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.060]   Christ is the ark.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.800]   Christ is the Savior.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   Christ is the refuge.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:43.360]   God has built his own ark for us and we have but to enter in by faith and we shall be safe
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.960]   when the world is burning and melting.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:59.480]   And all that is opposed to God is destroyed everlastingly out of his sight.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:05.360]   It all comes to that then that we believe God.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:16.000]   If you believe God tonight, the grace of God will deliver and will save you.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.800]   And what God says, my friend, is just this.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.300]   I'll put it in a phrase.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:33.500]   God is telling us that our sinfulness deserves the very selfsame punishment that he meted
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.420]   out to those people before the flood and will meet out at the end of the world.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:48.460]   He pronounces judgment upon sin in every shape and form and we are all sinners before him.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:54.420]   And there is but one way of escape, to believe that, to acknowledge it, to stop defending
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.660]   yourself, to stop trying to argue against it with your science or your knowledge or
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.660]   anything else.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:05.340]   It is to believe the simple word of God as Noah did, the word about yourself as a sinner,
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:16.200]   and to confess it and acknowledge it, to repent before God and to believe him, Father.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.160]   Then he tells you that he has prepared the ark for you, that he sent his only begotten
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.720]   Son to bear your sins and their punishment, and that if you believe that and enter into
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:34.780]   him, your sins will be all blotted out and you will be safe in life and safe in death
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.340]   and safe to all eternity.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:49.400]   The world in sin is under condemnation and the punishment will fall.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:58.940]   Can it be said of you, "But Noah, is that you?
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.320]   Are you covered by the but?
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.720]   Do you belong to Noah and his family?
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.280]   Are you a child of faith?
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.200]   Do you believe God if you do?"
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:17.920]   The but applies to you and the grace of God will redeem you and rescue you.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:30.280]   When the world is dissolving in the last calamity, you will be safe in the arms of Jesus and
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:36.640]   you will be beginning to enter upon a glory that shall never end.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   May God open our eyes to the message of the flood.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.400]   Amen.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.320]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
