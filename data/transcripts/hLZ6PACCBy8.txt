[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   - How would a kangaroo attack a human?
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.160]   - Knock 'em down and then they choke 'em.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Do the kangaroos do?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   - They choke each other, yeah.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.440]   - They don't choke each other.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.760]   - You don't believe me?
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.600]   You wanna watch a video?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.360]   They choke each other out.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.560]   - I've seen this, yeah.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.920]   - I mean, probably the most annoying one
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.600]   was obviously the one where I had Gordon Arnby
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.880]   I was like, "Tap, bro."
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820]   And he wouldn't tap, so I let him out.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.680]   - I didn't get surgery, I didn't do essentially any rehab,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.440]   I just have noise seal on my left leg.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   - So what's it like having noise?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.680]   - The surgeon goes, "You've got two options,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.960]   "surgery, rehab only."
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   Nikki goes, "I'll do nothing."
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.720]   Yeah, I mean, what could possibly go wrong
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.680]   if you're the world's best grappler, hates you,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.240]   and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.080]   Well, I mean.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.900]   - In Texas.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.560]   - And you've stolen his brother, held him for ransom.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.360]   - It is like a story of a shitty Western.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.320]   - The last part of a difficult wake up for me
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160]   is I try to find a sad movie and at least cry
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.800]   about a pound out.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   That really gets me over the line.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320]   - What are the rules in the streets?
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.080]   - Do you think if you're on steroids
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   you would have finished the choke?
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.240]   - I mean, for sure.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   - Who knew that the cure to the Dagestani wrestling
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.620]   were the Aussies?
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.640]   - The following is a conversation with Craig Jones,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.080]   Nikki Rod, and Nikki Ryan,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.040]   who together with Ethan Krelenston and others
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.800]   make up the B Team, a legendary jujitsu team
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.920]   It was formed after the so-called Donahar Death Squad,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.600]   the team headed by John Donahar, split up
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.480]   into New Wave Jiu-Jitsu and B Team Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.680]   both located here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.520]   There has been a lot of trash talk back and forth,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.240]   including accusations of greasing and steroid use.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.040]   And I, as a practitioner and fan of grappling,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   jiu-jitsu, and martial arts in general, am here for it.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.080]   To see the best grapplers in history,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   go at it, both on the mat and on Instagram.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.380]   I like the people on both teams and train with both,
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.100]   and am really happy to see the exciting,
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.720]   rapid evolution of the sport that these athletes
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.880]   and coaches are catalyzing.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.900]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.120]   in the description.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.440]   And now, dear friends, here's Craig Jones,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.240]   Nikki Rod, and Nikki Ryan.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.360]   Craig, can you introduce everyone?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.920]   - Yep, so we got Nikki Rod here, brown belt,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.440]   two-time ADCC silver medalist.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.640]   Nikki Ryan here.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.240]   That's it.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   (all laughing)
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.520]   - Who are you?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.020]   - And I'm Craig Jones, also two-time ADCC silver medalist.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.480]   - Silver medalist, so the number one loser.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.600]   - Number one loser.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080]   - And maybe a little bit more, your bio says,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.160]   "Widely known as the Black Belt Slayer,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.520]   "hails from New Jersey, the land of pizza and biceps."
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   - Yes, that's pretty accurate.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.920]   - You also do carry a gun on you a lot?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   - Yeah, I keep it loaded, you know, keep it on me.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   - You have one today?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.120]   - In the car.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.840]   - That was a mistake, that was your first mistake.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.360]   - Yeah, I think you're too close.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.940]   (all laughing)
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.800]   - And you are Nikki Ryan, what else is there?
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.880]   What else do we know?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.720]   - Gordon Ryan's brother.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.680]   - Gordon Ryan's brother.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.720]   - Waiting for that one.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   (all laughing)
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.840]   All right, so and you're all together,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.760]   part of the leadership of the B team here in Austin.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.720]   Let's just get out some introductory questions.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   What in general accomplishment
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.520]   of the things you mentioned are you most proud of?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.440]   - I mean, I'm proud just to not have to work a full-time job
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.560]   just to get by on the bullshit I've done so far.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.440]   - Yeah. - Honestly.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.040]   - Just making money of a thing you love.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.440]   - When was the first time you made money
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.080]   on a thing you love?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   - Oh, probably a jujitsu tournament.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   I think maybe in Abu Dhabi where I won $1,000,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.560]   thought I was rich.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.240]   - Yeah, yeah, what'd you spend that $1,000 on?
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.280]   - Probably something bad,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.760]   probably drugs or something at the time,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.640]   maybe blew it at the after party.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.840]   (all laughing)
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.120]   - That's a good introduction to Craig.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   So what about you?
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   When's the first time you made money on jujitsu?
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.400]   Or what's actually stepping back,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.720]   like what's the thing you're most proud of?
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   Is it a similar kind of thing?
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.040]   - I think I'm most proud of is, I mean,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.240]   for sure two 80cc silver medals,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.080]   which hurts 'cause you're so close to getting that gold,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.120]   but it takes time.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.400]   I'm understanding that sport of jujitsu
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.920]   takes quite a while to be at the tip top,
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.000]   to be the absolute best.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.960]   So, and I'm just being consistent in my training
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.280]   and my craft and I'll get that number one spot one day.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.760]   - What failure or loss is the most painful to you?
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.520]   - I don't know, I have a pretty short term memory.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   So my losses, I just forget about 'em.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.960]   Yeah, I mean, for sure my loss at this past 80cc
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.040]   in the finals, that one sunk in
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.920]   because I definitely thought I was gonna win.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.080]   I mean, like it takes a while to produce the skills
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   or the reactions more so that you need to have
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.240]   to be that number one pound for pound guy.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.840]   And pre 80cc, I was coming off an injury.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.000]   So it took me a little bit to find the right mentality
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.360]   and physicality that I needed in order to get the wins
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.520]   that required gold.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.200]   So yeah, it's just process.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.680]   - Interesting, you keep saying process,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.080]   like it takes a while to build up.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.880]   So you're not like thinking of a loss like 80cc
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.160]   as like a specific failures, you're not,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.760]   you haven't gone long enough in a particular process
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   to being a champ.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.400]   - Well, I mean, for me, I'm closing in on five years
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.360]   of specifically jujitsu training.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.400]   I'm about four and a half right now.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   And yeah, it's just, you constantly have these ups
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.640]   and downs in training where like,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   as long as you stay consistent, you'll have a gradual raise,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.720]   but it's still, you'll have these peaks and lows
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.120]   and just trying to get better every day.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.200]   I'm definitely not where I will be in a few years from now,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.400]   but I'm striving to get there.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   - Are you actually a brown belt or was that a joke?
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.440]   - Brown belt, yeah.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.720]   - You're a brown belt, like how many stripes?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.560]   - No stripes.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.400]   - No stripes.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.220]   - Stripeless.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.840]   - Okay, is that part of the process
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   that you're working through?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.320]   - Definitely part of the process.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.000]   I think a black belt is just based upon
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.640]   how much knowledge you have.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.320]   Obviously, if you're talking competitive wise,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.680]   like from when I started,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.320]   I was able to beat most black belts.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.760]   That's just kind of how I was gifted
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.080]   from my wrestling experience.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.960]   And the time will come when it's right,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.480]   but I'm not in a rush at all.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   I'm continuing.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.240]   I just kind of take every day for what it is
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.840]   and try to improve upon that.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.200]   - I mean, I want to give him the black belt.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.600]   Nikki Ryan says he's not ready.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.520]   (laughing)
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.360]   - Are you guys, as no-gi folks,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.760]   do you take that seriously?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.640]   Like the black belt?
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.960]   Or how much does it come into play into?
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.840]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like Nikki Rod said,
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.760]   it's based off of knowledge,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.000]   not just what you do out on the competition mats.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.720]   'Cause like you said, he had years of wrestling experience
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.320]   and obviously he's very physically gifted.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.400]   So we grade based off of the amount of knowledge
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   that you have.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.600]   - How do you measure knowledge?
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.560]   - I think teaching is a good measurement of it.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.320]   Like how well you're able to show the moves
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.560]   and really make sure that you have an understanding
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.800]   of what you're doing.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   - Yeah, it's an interesting rank.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.120]   It's like something that takes many years to accomplish.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.680]   And for a lot of people, it's truly meaningful.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's like it represents a particular step in a journey.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   But for you guys, it's almost like different
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.400]   because you've been so focused on competition
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.800]   that I guess if you take it seriously,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.040]   it is a big step for you too.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.520]   Like as martial artists,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.920]   that's bigger than just being
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.720]   like top of the world competitors, right?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.760]   So I thought it was a joke.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.120]   You guys are actually taking it seriously.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.960]   - That he's a brown belt.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   - That he's a brown belt and you're taking seriously
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   the rank of black belt and like, it's part of your journey.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.640]   - Think by the time I get a black belt,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.480]   I'll be no more pound for pound.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.200]   I think it'd be pretty nice to accomplish that
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.640]   as a brown belt and then maybe toss a black belt on top.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.740]   - Maybe get promoted on the podium.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.800]   What do you guys, do you love winning or hate losing more?
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.280]   - I definitely don't hate losing.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.200]   If it pays the bills, I don't mind.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   - Oh, really?
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.600]   - Yeah, but honestly, if I win,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.000]   I feel more relief than anything
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.640]   rather than like excitement and stuff.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.080]   I'm like, oh, fuck, thank God that's over.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.040]   - I hate losing for sure.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.680]   But I understand that it's necessary
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.400]   to get to where you wanna be.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.280]   And then winning is like, I mean,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   what I think winning is probably the closest
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.400]   you can get to like heroin or something.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.520]   'Cause I mean, we're on a,
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.280]   like if you do have extreme success
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.640]   and a torment that you've been adamant about training for
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.600]   and competing in for a while and you end up winning it,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.920]   I mean, I feel like you're on that high
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.640]   for days at a time afterwards.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.600]   - Heroin's gonna be better.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.440]   - You think so?
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.400]   I'm gonna stick with no, but.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   - I'm not gonna suck dick to win.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.800]   - You suck dick for heroin?
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.640]   Okay.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.400]   (laughing)
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.800]   I guess that's a good point, yeah.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.640]   - Well, you know, like,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   because you're coming from a little bit
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.840]   of a wrestling culture.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.040]   One of the things I really love
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.440]   is at the end of the match, when they lose,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.320]   they just, there's no, they just run off.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.720]   They're like almost pissed off.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.840]   It's like some mixture of anger
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.480]   and frustration at themselves.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.800]   - I think sometimes that people like freak out on the mat.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.920]   And I think that's just to show everybody,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.560]   like they're acting like they cared a lot
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.360]   and really maybe they didn't work enough
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.440]   to get to where they wanted,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.880]   to where they expected to be and they lost.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.560]   And then they had this big boost of emotion
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.480]   like after their loss.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.400]   But yeah, I mean,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.360]   I think you just cry in the mirror
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   and not to everybody else, you know.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.640]   - Have you ever cried watching a movie?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.920]   - I don't think I've ever cried, period.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.840]   - Okay.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.680]   - Have you cried watching a movie?
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.800]   - Not yet, not yet.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   - "The Notebook"?
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.920]   - I try to avoid those movies.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.720]   Actually, I lie, actually.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.560]   - "Titanic"?
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.400]   - The last part of a difficult wake up for me
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.240]   is I try to find a sad movie and at least cry.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.840]   I bet a pound out.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.440]   That really gets me over the line.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.680]   Low energy cutting.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.520]   - The tears.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.000]   (laughing)
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.680]   There's other following liquids I could talk to you about,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.520]   but let's just continue on.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.360]   - Low energy.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.200]   (laughing)
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.720]   - What about you, Nicky?
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   Love of winning versus hate of losing.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.040]   - I'm a very competitive person,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.400]   so I for sure hate losing more than I like winning.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.200]   I do think it's something that's kind of held me back
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.280]   over the past few years
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.480]   'cause it makes it so that I'm not as active as I should be
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   'cause it's like I really hate that feeling of,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.040]   you know, after a match that you just lost.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.840]   So it kind of prevents me from competing,
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.080]   so it's definitely something I need to work past.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.920]   - So like when you think about a competition,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.160]   the possibility of losing,
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.800]   which is always there in competition,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.920]   is the thing that like weighs heavy on you
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.000]   in the months and weeks leading up to it.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.720]   - Yeah, my whole life, you know, my financial stability,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   everything depends on, you know,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   my ability to go out there and compete
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.880]   and my ability to teach.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.400]   So, you know, it's a huge hit to the brand if you lose.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.040]   So, you know, leading up to matches,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.360]   that's definitely something that's in my mind.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.640]   - I know, so you guys are like world-class athletes,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.080]   but for me, more like a hobbyist competitor.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.840]   I compete a lot.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.000]   The thing I was, 'cause I really wanted to win,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.400]   the thing I was probably most afraid of
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.000]   was not just losing, but like embarrassing myself.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.840]   - Yeah.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.760]   - Even actually winning by stalling.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.720]   That was the thing I hated the most about myself
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.160]   in terms of crying in the mirror.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.560]   Is like being too afraid to take risks
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.840]   after I'm up on two points or something.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   - I think you gotta, in competition,
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.160]   sometimes it's good to take the emotion out of it.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.960]   It's too easy sometimes to like think about,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.880]   oh, my girls in the crowd, my family's watching,
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.920]   like I wanna win 'cause they're there.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.480]   But at the highest level, if you're emotional at all,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.720]   no, that's affecting you.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.180]   - Yeah, that's tough though.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.680]   That's tough, especially like leading up to it,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.120]   when you're on the mat maybe, but leading up to it.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.160]   I think it's okay to be emotional prior.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.520]   Like if we know ADCC is coming up and we have a big match,
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.200]   like definitely I'll go out in practice
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.280]   and I'll visualize, I'll put myself in that competition.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.400]   That way when it's game time,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.360]   it's like I've been there a thousand times already.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   - So not the actual competition, but even leading up to it,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.320]   like stepping on the mat, like all the walk towards it,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.160]   all that.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   - All that stuff.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.360]   Like I'll do the same exact warmup for weeks on end
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.520]   until my competition day comes.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   That way, when I compete, I'm just like,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.600]   oh, it's another Tuesday at practice.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.800]   - All right, what about you, Craig?
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.680]   How do you prepare mentally for a tournament like ADCC?
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.760]   - I push it completely out of my mind.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.260]   Don't even think about it.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.760]   Try to avoid any visualization, any rituals, warmups,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.960]   anything like that.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.760]   Block it out until the last second.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.320]   Yeah, try not to think about it.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.960]   I just go to training to have fun, learn a bit.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.460]   So I try to approach competition the exact same way.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.280]   I don't warm up at training,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   do very little warmup for competition.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.120]   - Uh-huh, and you just step on the mat?
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960]   - Step on the mats.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.360]   My philosophy is there's no warmups on the street.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.520]   (laughing)
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.760]   - We're so vastly different.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.920]   All right, so you like legit don't warm up?
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.040]   - No, I probably should now I'm 31,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.760]   but I would just like in the gym,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.880]   take it easy the first round.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.320]   You know, like if I look around the room
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.480]   and Nikki Ryan's there, I might go,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.440]   all right, we'll have an easier first round today.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.280]   Jump in.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.920]   (laughing)
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.280]   - So even for like the most high stakes matches,
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.720]   you try to push it out?
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.680]   - Yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.160]   - What about like all the social,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.320]   like Instagram posts you have to do about that match?
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.240]   You just make a joke out of it and kinda--
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   - Yeah, I mean, it's all kinda pretty silly.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.520]   You know, we're just wrestling each other.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.720]   We put the meaning into it,
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.120]   but to someone that doesn't follow the sport,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.280]   it looks stupid.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.740]   - Well, all of human existence is pretty silly.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.960]   Like what are we doing?
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.760]   None of us really know what's going on.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.960]   We kinda have sex to reproduce.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   We get hungry, we eat,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.160]   and then we're all chasing money and cars
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.400]   and whatever the hell.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.920]   In a capitalist society,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.680]   or we worship a dictator in a authoritarian regime.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.920]   Yeah, and then we get off on,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.080]   we'll let power abuse us,
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.400]   and then we just murder others because we get off on it.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.520]   Yeah, and then eventually all of us will die
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.280]   because the sun will run out of energy
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.680]   'cause colonizing other planets is very difficult.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.040]   So none of it matters.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.720]   It's a good philosophy.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.920]   It's pretty good.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.640]   - That's exactly what I was thinking.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.160]   - How does the sun run out of energy?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.720]   (laughing)
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.880]   - You caught me there.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.840]   It's burned out.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.800]   It's a nuclear fusion engine that eventually burns out.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.320]   - Like when you get tired of training.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.960]   - Yeah. - It's never happened.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.800]   I try to get tired.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.640]   I just like, dude, it's not working.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.280]   (laughing)
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.500]   - All right, cool.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.080]   So you legit don't care about losing.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.520]   It doesn't weigh heavy on you.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.960]   - I try not to list,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.800]   like if I win, I try to block out all the compliments,
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.980]   all the niceties and stuff.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.280]   So I try to do the same with losing.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.160]   It's happened.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.520]   Move on to the next one.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.480]   Don't dwell on it too much.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.800]   - And sometimes make a joke out of it.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.960]   Winning or losing, with the right joke,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.880]   we can make money off of the events that transpired.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.480]   That's what's most important.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.360]   - Excellent, thank you.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.920]   I have a bunch of your merch.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.160]   - Oh, nice. - Thank you.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.200]   - This one's the Jordan Burroughs ripoff.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.680]   - All I see is silver.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.960]   The way it pronounces Burroughs is very, very sexy.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800]   Okay.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.120]   - I throw lines at people and I try to gauge their reaction.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.320]   Sometimes I'll say something to Nikki
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.480]   and I'll be like, all right,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.760]   that's probably crossing the line.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.920]   We'll tone it down for the public.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.580]   So it's not just, right,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.080]   you have to think, is this crossing the line?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.200]   I get as close to it as possible.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.040]   I feel like you can't really cross it.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.280]   - And then cross it just a little bit.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.200]   - Just a little bit, yeah.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.040]   - Okay.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.960]   Speaking of which,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.080]   you said that I'm Switzerland in World War II
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.920]   since I'm friends with both you and Gordon and John.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   - Very rich country.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.000]   - Are you a Hitler or a Stalin, by the way, in this analogy?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.080]   Would you like to be Hitler or Stalin?
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.000]   And should you make a t-shirt out of it?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.600]   - I mean, a Nazi t-shirt,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.040]   I don't know how well that sells.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.440]   - I think it would, you know,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   I think let's brainstorm on this one offline.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.840]   I think since Hitler lost,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.520]   so he got second place in World War II.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.360]   - That's true, that's true.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   - I think that makes you Hitler.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.840]   Anyway, to the degree that you can,
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.080]   can you tell the story of how,
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.640]   the time you've had with the Donahoe Death Squad
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   and why you split up?
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   - I competed against Gordon for ADCC and EBI in 2017.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.600]   And I remember I competed against him at ADCC
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.280]   and then we had the EBI event.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   And then I had a Kassai.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.200]   I used to compete all the time, every week.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   I wouldn't even do the preparation or anything.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.680]   I'd just be like trying to do seminars, make money
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.800]   and then jump in and compete.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.760]   I remember I showed up to Kassai after I faced him twice
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.960]   and there were like four locker rooms
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.760]   and they put me with all the DDS guys.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.880]   It was just me and all of DDS.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.320]   And I think we competed the weekend before.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.520]   So I thought it was gonna be super awkward,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.800]   but it was actually pretty chill.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.680]   And the Kassai was in New York
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.480]   and they suggested to come train that week.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.760]   So I came trained, hung out with them a bit.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   Ultimately the goal was to move to America
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.720]   and join a bigger team
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.040]   just 'cause that flight to Australia is death.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.400]   Australia is so far away from everywhere.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.480]   It's kind of like not realistic to base yourself
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.280]   in Australia when all the tournaments are in America.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.960]   And then I went and trained with the guys
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   and they just had a massively deep talent pool in that room.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.880]   Like show up to like a meant to be 7 a.m.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.160]   actual 8 a.m. class on Brazilian time.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.560]   And there'd be like a hundred people in there
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.600]   maybe I don't know how many black belts,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.840]   but a ton of elite guys.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.440]   And I was coming from Australia,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.720]   training with Lachlan Giles,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.520]   but really that room was pretty shallow.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.200]   And like most people had serious jobs and stuff.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.520]   So it was like basically me just training with Lachlan,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.920]   maybe a couple of other guys,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.440]   and then to go to New York and have access
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   to a wide array of training partners
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.000]   and guys that are training twice each day.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.400]   I feel like that's what you really need.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.120]   You need people that can train as much as you are.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.560]   - You get humbled.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   - Humble. - You get humbled
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   in that room at first.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.680]   - For sure, 'cause my style at the time
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.720]   was basically a rip off version of what they were doing.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.600]   Leg locks came in.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.920]   I remember just watching Eddie Cummings nonstop
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.160]   and just seeing this guy rip people's legs off.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.080]   That's probably a good move.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.200]   You know, that looks like an easier path to victory
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.720]   than trying to beat these guys
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.560]   at what they're good at already.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.000]   My philosophy at the time was
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.440]   if it's bothering old Brazilians,
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.320]   it's bothering them for a reason.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.800]   It's probably effective.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   And that's the path I took to sort of
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   try to rip off their moves.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.440]   And then obviously to go into that room,
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.360]   try to do them to them,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.080]   it's gonna be a bit more difficult.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.440]   - All right, so that's how it started.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.520]   How did you end up here?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.600]   - How do we end up here?
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.080]   - We're in Austin, Texas.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   - I mean, I like to think of Puerto Rico as apocalypse now.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.440]   John Danaher as Colonel Kurtz.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.840]   Things got very weird in the jungle
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.880]   and the teams went in two different directions.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.120]   But honestly, I mean, it's not really my story to tell.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.040]   I had some issues with some of those people.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.360]   At the time of the split,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.400]   I got along very well with John.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.320]   I feel like me and him connected very well.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.040]   I don't know why that was.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.240]   Maybe it was just 'cause he missed home.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.360]   He missed a familiar accent,
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.920]   Australian, New Zealand accent.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.280]   But I mean, I basically followed Nicky,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   left with Nicky,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.760]   sort of that core group of guys left with Nicky.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.200]   And I mean, I just backed,
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.040]   there was personal problems
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   and I just backed Nicky, basically.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.760]   - Got it.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.920]   Just sticking on you for a bit.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.000]   Is there a part of you that finds it heartbreaking
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.680]   that DDS split up?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.720]   This part of you miss working with John and everybody?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   Now, can you steal me on the case for that?
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.280]   - I mean, I miss certain aspects of it,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.400]   but I also do prefer the freedom of being apart from it.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.840]   It's obviously a very strict regime under John Danaher.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   You know, obviously there's parts of it I miss.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.720]   The parts the public doesn't see of John,
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.040]   the behind the scenes banter,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.680]   I feel like he's very conscious
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.200]   of the image he portrays to the world.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.360]   But basically, closed doors,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.440]   he's always making jokes,
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.320]   always finding, I guess,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.920]   more in line with the Australian Kiwi sort of culture.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.200]   But you don't really see that in the public eye.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.720]   So that perspective,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.040]   I do miss that relationship with John.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.720]   In terms of setting aside personal differences,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.840]   Gordon was a good training partner,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.640]   definitely a good training partner to train with.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.840]   But obviously the negative things
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.120]   we can't really talk about outweighed all of those things.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.520]   And we obviously had to make a decision to leave.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.560]   - The things that happened in the jungle.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.920]   - The things that happened in the jungle.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   - Should never be spoken of.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.800]   - That I personally cannot speak of.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.400]   Yeah, but obviously I do miss certain aspects.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.240]   Like, I mean, nothing's all bad,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   nothing's all good, you know?
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.360]   - Yeah, this goes back to your,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.520]   like, everything we're doing is silly.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.040]   That's why I don't get people take it so serious,
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.080]   martial arts so serious.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.280]   It's just pretty stupid, really.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.200]   Especially in the Gi, it looks just, it looks bad.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.040]   And then I see--
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.080]   - I mean, it's pretty silly with and without the Gi.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.720]   It's just a bunch of apes.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.200]   - What's silly about no Gi,
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.320]   and what's silly about the Gi,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.080]   and just mixed and matched bottoms there,
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.120]   you know what I mean?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   - Wait, which one?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.160]   - Sambo, yeah.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.960]   - I see what you're doing.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   Brother, you come to my house and offend my people.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.360]   All right.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.560]   We're gonna go to every dark place, apparently.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   Nick, how did you get with DDS?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.880]   Like, what was that journey like?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   Is there, try to see if there's things
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.640]   that you remember fondly
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.200]   that you've gotten from the experience.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.120]   - All right, so the way I started training with DDS,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.360]   initially I was training for like,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.680]   well, initially I was a bouncer, right?
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.880]   I dropped out of college
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.120]   to pursue this fitness modeling career.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.760]   I ended up signing with Wilhelmina Models up in New York,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.880]   and I was like, just trying to get in better shape.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.720]   And while I was bouncing,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.120]   kind of the talk of like, you know,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.600]   who's tougher came up between the wrestlers
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.040]   and a few of the bouncers that train Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.480]   And, you know, they convinced me to go to a practice,
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.400]   and I went to my first practice over there.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.320]   And for the most part,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.160]   I just controlled everybody, got on top of them,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.360]   was able to avoid like, kind of like, you know,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.960]   shitty submissions, 'cause I had an awareness of the sport,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.080]   and, you know, I'm a fan of fighting and whatnot.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.240]   So, you know, I kind of understood it pretty well.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960]   And then soon after that, I joined a school,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.800]   and my second week of Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.960]   I started competing, had pretty good success.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.520]   You know, I was like subbing a few black belts
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.840]   and beating everybody like, you know,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.000]   pretty decisively with points and stuff.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.880]   And about three months into training locally,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.280]   I got connected with Gordon Ryan and John Danaher
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.120]   up in New York, and I started,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   I committed to, you know, make the drive up there
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.280]   as many days as I could.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.760]   At the time, I lived in South Jersey,
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.400]   and it was about a two and a half hour,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.080]   three hour drive without traffic to New York.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.200]   - Where in South Jersey?
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.600]   - Gloucester County, Clayton, New Jersey specifically,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.880]   but Gloucester County.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.680]   Yeah, so it was about 130 miles,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.400]   and without traffic, you know, about two and a half hours
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.040]   or so, but on the way back, man,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.560]   it'd be three plus sometimes, you know,
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   when you're catching that rush hour.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.880]   - What year was this, do you remember?
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.760]   - This was in 2018. - South Jersey for a bit.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.640]   I forget how young you are.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   - Yeah. - I was there before,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.760]   before all that, all right, cool.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.680]   Anyway, you're doing the long drive, and then what?
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.880]   - Yeah, doing the long drive, and then, you know,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.640]   once I won ADCC trials, I was able to make a couple bucks,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.880]   and then, you know, I got my silver medal at ADCC,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.480]   and I was able to afford to live up there in New York
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   in North Jersey area.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.360]   So I lived up there, trained there full-time every day,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.400]   and, you know, it was kind of sucked with the team
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.280]   throughout the turbulent times,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.360]   and found ourself in Austin.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.920]   - In the jungle. - In the jungle, yeah.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.760]   - One of the things we shall not speak of.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.000]   (laughing)
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.920]   What are the things that you remember
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.720]   that you've learned from John Donaher
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.760]   from your time you spent with him?
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I definitely learned a ton from John
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.000]   and the team as a whole.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.240]   Like, you know, you have to be the guy
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.200]   that asks questions in that type of environment, right?
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.760]   'Cause you're not gonna get singled out
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.680]   to be that specific star or the best guy in the room
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.640]   when you have all these other stud athletes.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.000]   So I really had to seek out
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.160]   and figure out the kind of questions that I needed to ask.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.360]   And once I became a bit more verbal with my training,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.680]   and, you know, I'm expressing all my curiosities
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.120]   about grappling to these guys,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.440]   definitely helped boost my technique
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.480]   and my career as a whole.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.440]   - Yeah, did you understand what kind of stuff,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.040]   like, technically, you wanna get good at,
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   what fits your body, what would be good for you,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.960]   what are your weaknesses and all that?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.840]   - So initially, when I started grappling,
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.200]   I had an innate ability to just get to opponent's back.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.800]   So I was like, all right, I'm good at getting to the back,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   let me perfect controlling the back
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.080]   and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.440]   And then besides that, I really focused on leg lock defense.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.240]   And then eventually came the body lock pass
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.080]   where, you know, I'm really good at body lock pass
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.440]   on my opponents now.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.800]   And yeah, it just takes quite a long time
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.200]   'cause you have to find different sequences
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.320]   and then there's always these,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.720]   an abundance of opportunities that your opponent gets
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.000]   from these specific sequences.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.200]   So it takes a while.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.480]   - Is there part of you that finds the fact
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.560]   that DGS split up heartbreaking?
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.600]   - I definitely, you know, having one person to go to
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   that runs practice every day, that's, you know, consistent,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.160]   it was definitely a gift,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.200]   but now I'm also gifted with many, many other partners.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   I have Nikki Ryan, you know, Craig Jones.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.400]   (all laughing)
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   We have Ethan, Crelacy, Damian Anderson.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.360]   So a full team of knowledgeable athletes
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.320]   that I can continue to go to with multiple questions,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.760]   but yeah, definitely it took me some time to adjust
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.520]   to training or to learning from, you know,
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.760]   specifically my team and not just one person.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.720]   - We should mention for people just listening,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.800]   'cause you can't visually see
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.160]   that Nikki Ryan is currently terrified
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   and Craig Jones is currently enjoying
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.200]   the fact that he's terrified.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.760]   But anyway, can you talk about your,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.960]   Nikki, can you talk about your time with DDS?
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.000]   - I started training when I was like around 13.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   You know, my brother Gordon had started prior to me
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   and I really just went into training
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.960]   just as like a means to exercise and lose weight
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.480]   at the beginning 'cause I was pretty fat as a kid.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.960]   So I went to the first class, loved it,
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.640]   and then just started training every day
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.960]   at Gary's Gym, Brunswick.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.120]   And then during the summer when I'd get off from school,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.480]   they would take me up to New York to train under John.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.640]   And you know, I just absolutely loved it.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.960]   I knew what I wanted to do with my life at a young age.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.480]   So I ended up dropping out of school
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.440]   actually after my freshman year in high school.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.560]   So yeah, 15, I ended up dropping out
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.960]   and just pursuing jiu-jitsu full-time,
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.440]   you know, training every day up in the blue basement.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.560]   - Like what aspects of jiu-jitsu made you know
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.240]   that this is the thing for you?
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.360]   - It was just something I just enjoyed being,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.840]   you know, like on the mats every day.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.760]   I love that there's, you know,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.480]   a problem solving aspect to it.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.960]   So it's, you know, it's mentally challenging,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.400]   it's physically challenging, helps me get in shape.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.880]   So I just, yeah, right off the bat, I knew I loved it.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   - Okay, so then we'll go to the jungle.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.040]   What happened in the jungle?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.000]   (both laughing)
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.600]   And in general, like...
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.520]   (both laughing)
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.360]   I like this, I like this.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.800]   This is like this like shroud of mystery
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.880]   that she'll never be penetrated,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.200]   that she'll never be like--
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.600]   - We've got a book deal, it's coming one day.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.640]   - A book deal?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.440]   - Obviously he left high school, he's not riding it.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.200]   (both laughing)
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.560]   - Okay, I'll do the Russian translation.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.120]   (both laughing)
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   Okay, so what are things that you enjoyed
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.280]   that you remember from working with John Donner?
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.880]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously he's considered
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.440]   one of the best coaches in the world.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.560]   You know, very charismatic guy when you see him in person.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.200]   You know, I pretty much was, you know,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.160]   kind of raised in the DDS, you know,
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.520]   that's where I spent the majority of my time every day.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.360]   So I obviously had very deep connections, you know,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.840]   with John, my brother, Gary, you know,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.160]   even Eddie Cummings and stuff back then.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.600]   So obviously I miss interacting with those guys every day.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.160]   And, you know, it's like they said,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.720]   it's good to have somebody to kind of
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.520]   crack the whip at you every day.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   And John was very good at that.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.440]   - When you're like younger in your teenage years,
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.040]   you can kind of, you like have to get humbled, right?
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.560]   There's like a process to that.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.400]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.760]   - And it's a pretty good room to get humbled in, I guess.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.520]   I mean, I started training with them
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.560]   just when like everybody started to break out.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.880]   Gary was like the biggest name at the time,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.960]   just 'cause he had won ADCC trials already.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.600]   And he had a crazy match with Kron,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.400]   had Kron Gracie at ADCC.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.360]   But Eddie was just starting to break out.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.920]   Gordon just started winning EBI.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.160]   So I started training under John, you know,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.120]   right when everything was exploding.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.720]   - What are the good things about life,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.760]   about jiu-jitsu you learned from your brother?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.440]   - Both me and my brother never really wanted to,
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.840]   you know, work a full-time job
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.360]   doing something that we hate.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.160]   And he was always, you know, a very confident person.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.880]   So he just went, you know, fully started pursuing jiu-jitsu.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.760]   So I'm very happy that, you know, he did that.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.380]   And I ended up following in his footsteps.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.800]   Because you can ask these guys,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   I'm a lazy sack of shit outside of the mat.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.040]   So that's definitely one thing that I'm very grateful for.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.520]   - That he paved the way, like you can make money
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.560]   doing the stuff you love.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.840]   And he was a big reason, you know,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.960]   why my parents eventually let me drop out of school.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.880]   Because, you know, when they were coming up,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.840]   there was no money in the sport.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.720]   It was very hard to make a full living.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.760]   Like if you wanted to actually make a living,
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.960]   you'd eventually have to transfer to MMA.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.800]   And I feel like Gordon and Gary and those guys
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.100]   were, you know, some of the first people
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.320]   to make a very good living off of just jiu-jitsu.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   - At this party, you find it heartbreaking
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.200]   that you've split up from DDS,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.960]   but also from your brother in terms of spending time
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.160]   in the mat every day.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.980]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.440]   You know, I mean, growing up, you know,
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.820]   obviously he's my big brother.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.520]   I looked up to him a lot.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.800]   So I definitely, like I said,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.480]   I miss interacting with those guys.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.920]   I was pretty much raised, you know, in that blue basement,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.800]   you know, that John was like, you know,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.040]   a father figure to me.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.520]   So I definitely, you know, miss seeing those guys every day.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.480]   - Do you have animosity towards Gordon
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.720]   and does he have animosity toward you?
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.760]   And what is the source of that?
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.120]   And do you think you'll ever be able to forgive each other?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.600]   - Definitely initially during the initial split,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.800]   we definitely hated each other at the beginning,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.320]   but it's definitely started to calm down.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.280]   Actually just prior to, you know,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.320]   all this social media drama that's going on currently,
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.840]   he had reached out to me and that was literally like
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.200]   the first time that we have actually talked
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.880]   since the split happened.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.200]   So we didn't talk to each other for,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.160]   what is it now, like almost two years.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.000]   And that was the first time that, you know,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.520]   we interacted again and overall, you know,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.560]   he wasn't aggressive towards me.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.040]   I wasn't aggressive towards him.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.160]   We were cracking some jokes.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.600]   So hopefully the animosity is going down.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.200]   - There's this a godfather quote that wrote down,
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.440]   I recently rewatched it from the Don,
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.480]   from Don Corleone, Vito Corleone,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.200]   "The strength of a family, like the strength of an army
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.160]   lies in its loyalty to each other."
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.600]   Is there some aspect of family that you miss?
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.920]   Of the blood that kind of connects you,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.240]   that you can count on?
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.760]   - Yeah, my parents, you know, they both raised us that,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.160]   you know, like family is everything.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   You never, you know, betray your family
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.680]   or anything like that.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.960]   So I definitely, you know, miss him from time to time.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.480]   - Okay, imagine you're like 40 years from now,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.160]   sitting on a porch with a shotgun, drinking whiskey,
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.000]   looking over like all the land you've conquered.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.600]   Looking back to this moment,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.400]   is the reason you split up a bullshit reason?
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   Or is it a good reason?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   From the perspective of the king
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   who has now conquered the lands,
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.440]   have proven himself, have done everything.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.720]   - I think it was definitely like a justifiable reason
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.160]   for the team splitting.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.200]   Like it just, with the way things were going,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.240]   it just was not gonna work with, you know,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   all of us in the same room together.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.280]   It started, you know, affecting training,
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.000]   people didn't feel comfortable and things.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.560]   So I definitely think that it was a justifiable reason
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.880]   to split.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.920]   - The things that happened in the jungle.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.760]   - Yeah.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.920]   - To be told about in the book.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.000]   Is it gonna be an audio book or is it just gonna be,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.280]   who's gonna voice it?
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.200]   - Might be a play.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.240]   - A musical?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.080]   - Yeah, a musical.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.920]   - On Broadway.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.640]   How's your singing voice?
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.600]   - Mine's not so good, but Nicky has a beautiful voice.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   - Does he?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.280]   Of an angel?
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   I bet.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.840]   Okay.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.240]   Speaking of the social media drama,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.080]   I should mention that I've talked recently
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.240]   to Gordon a bunch.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.320]   I've talked to him about talking to you guys
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.080]   and he's had nothing but really nice things to say
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.920]   about you, Nicky Ryan.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.840]   And he has had nothing but bad things.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.440]   - What was some of the things?
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   - Well, let's just go to the social media first.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.520]   (laughing)
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.880]   'Cause the social media stuff that he said publicly
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.480]   is just like a warmup.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.040]   It's like a foreplay, I guess.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   So Gordon sent you, Nicky Ryan, flowers for Valentine's Day
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.840]   posting on Instagram, quote, "I've been fucking him
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.400]   "in every round and competition since we met in 2018.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.760]   "The least I can do is buy him flowers."
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.000]   - We didn't get the flowers.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.840]   (laughing)
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.680]   - Yeah, that was the question.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.720]   Did you get the flowers?
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.560]   You never got the flowers?
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.080]   - He sent it to the wrong address.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.920]   - He did?
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.760]   - Yeah.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   - Where do you think he sent it?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.400]   - It was close, but it was wrong.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.720]   - Did you appreciate the romantic gesture?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.680]   - I did, I was looking forward to the flowers
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.000]   and potentially chocolates in there.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.160]   But it was a bit of a letdown.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.640]   - Can you describe your recent match against Gordon,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.760]   the EBI match?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.200]   - Okay, so EBI match on UFC Fight Pass
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.840]   was a 20 minute match.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.440]   And immediately, match starts, I pull guard,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.920]   and then I stand up, he pulls guard.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   And we have this kind of like back and forth
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.320]   where he's trying to dig for underhooks,
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.280]   trying to get on top of me,
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.120]   and he can't really find success.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.800]   And then in the midst of me trying to work
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.640]   my body lock pass, Gordon's able to underhook a leg
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.120]   and we end up in a leg entanglement.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.280]   And then I'm able to transfer that leg entanglement
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.520]   to a 50/50 position, still in the leg entanglement.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.960]   From that 50/50 position, I'm able to separate his feet
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   and actually get a few pops.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.880]   And he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   - With a toe hold.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.560]   - With a toe hold, yep.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   And after that, we had a bit more,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.280]   I was just working on top positions,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.240]   trying to get my body lock, time runs out,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.520]   and we go to overtime.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.360]   And overtime--
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.440]   - Can you hold on a second?
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.120]   What does it mean to break a leg?
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.840]   I was very confused about, is this like a expression?
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.400]   Or what do you mean, which part breaks in a toe hold?
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.200]   - Okay, so in a toe hold,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.000]   there's a few different grades of it.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.880]   Like you could get a few pops
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.720]   and have some walking issues.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.440]   And people consider that a break.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.640]   And then you could break it fully
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.440]   and have your foot be like a limp noodle.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.160]   I think what goes to Achilles,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.560]   what is it, front of the Achilles or something?
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.080]   - I mean, probably the ligaments.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.040]   I mean, it's funny, like a lot of people say
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.800]   they broke something, but like to me,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.840]   you break bones, you tear ligaments.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.600]   So I would imagine you probably had a grade three tear.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.360]   - Grade three.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.600]   - How hard do you think is it to,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.800]   I always wondered that with like a straight foot lock,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.160]   how hard is it to break the shin
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.600]   or like the actual bones versus to tear stuff?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.360]   - Depends how many steroids they're on.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.120]   And obviously how much you're on.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:17.960]   - You're one of the few guys
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.400]   that have actually broken bones in competition.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.680]   - Yeah, have I?
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.520]   - Oh yeah, Vinny.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   - A couple, yeah.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.600]   - Which bone did you break?
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.520]   - Spiral fracture of the fibula.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   Very specific.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.360]   - A lot of power.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.200]   (laughing)
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.020]   - Is it like a twist thing?
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.860]   How did you break it?
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.700]   - Oh, it was a heel hook.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.600]   Vinny always used to say heel hooks don't work,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.080]   leg locks don't work.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.320]   But unfortunately, age gets the best of all of us.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.800]   I think he had some mileage on those ligaments.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.640]   - Yeah.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.480]   - And the bone, I guess, yeah.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.600]   - So it's actually what, the bone?
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.320]   - Yeah, his ankle disconnected from the tibia
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.480]   and the fibula, but the fibula definitely
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.800]   snapped pretty bad there.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.680]   - That's fascinating.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   The dynamics of that.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.360]   Okay, anyway, it went into overtime.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.280]   What happened in overtime?
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.240]   - Okay, I'll have an overtime.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.920]   Let's see, trying to hang.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.640]   Oh, okay, I go defense first.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.680]   Whistle blows, I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080]   And then immediately after I go on his back
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.960]   and he gets out in exactly 17 seconds.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.440]   I'm like, shit, all right, I thought I had a good start.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.400]   And then he gets on my back right after that.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.960]   And he's able to ride me out
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.160]   for pretty much the entire round.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.640]   After that, I go back on his back.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.880]   He escapes in maybe like a minute and some change.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.680]   I think where I went wrong in the overtime
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.480]   is I should have been less adamant
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.040]   about chasing the submission
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.720]   and more aware of collecting time.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   If I kind of diverted my attention
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.440]   towards acquiring time on the clock,
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.360]   it would have been more in my favor.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.520]   But yeah, at the end of my overtime round,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.440]   I'm able to lock up a renegade choke over the face,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.840]   but there just wasn't enough time to fully finish.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.680]   I got a few seconds of squeeze in there.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.640]   I didn't have enough time to adjust.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.000]   - Do you think if you're on steroids,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.120]   you would have finished the choke?
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.760]   - I mean, for sure, for sure.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.600]   - That's what I thought too.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.440]   - If you're on gear,
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.600]   you're changing the biology of your body.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.520]   You're adjusting your DNA.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.360]   For sure, if I adjust in my DNA,
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.640]   I mean, it's a finish, easy finish.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.680]   - So you're implying you're a natural athlete is what you say.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.040]   - Oh, I'm definitely a natural athlete, yeah.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.120]   Heavy implication.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.360]   (laughing)
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.000]   - Okay, so for people who don't know,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.200]   the EBI rules, it's an interesting rule structure
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.960]   where the overtime, you put yourself
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.920]   in the worst possible position,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.320]   and the task is to escape,
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.280]   and then the other person gets the same thing.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.800]   What do you guys think about that rule set?
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.480]   - I like it just because, first of all,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.800]   I don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.040]   but I do like the definitive answer in the match.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.520]   Like either you escaped in time or you got ridden out.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.960]   So the absolutely, like you get to define a winner,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.800]   that's great.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.880]   I'd much rather have that than a close decision
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.720]   and it kind of goes the other way.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.560]   - What about you?
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.160]   - I mean, honestly, there's all the different rules.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.120]   When I look at the rule sets,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.040]   I just try to think of what rule set
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.680]   I could beat that individual in.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.800]   And I sort of gear myself towards that.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.080]   That's really the strategy there.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   I think there's some guys that stall a lot,
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.000]   that you would love to have EBI overtime with at the end.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.280]   They're stalling until they have to give us a good position.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.120]   But then there's some guys
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.280]   that are so good in those positions,
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.140]   I'm like, "Oh, maybe we just do a regular match."
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.160]   - What are the rules in the streets?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.000]   - The streets?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.160]   No time limit.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.840]   - Yeah, that's one of it.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.360]   There's also like concrete and cars and stuff.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.480]   - Biting.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.640]   - Biting, yeah.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.480]   - Poking.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.440]   Yeah, so you don't like that rule set?
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.760]   Are there some people you would prefer
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.920]   in the street as a rule set?
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.840]   - Me, probably not.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.800]   (laughing)
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.000]   I don't know though, EBI.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.840]   I mean, it's tricky.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.920]   It depends on the opponent,
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.080]   which rule set I'd wanna do.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:39:59.920]   - Wow, what about you, Nicker?
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.960]   What do you think about the rule set of EBI?
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.400]   - Yes, I think EBI is very good
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.200]   from a spectator point of view.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.800]   People find it very entertaining to watch
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.680]   'cause people wanna see submissions
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.960]   and you're putting the athletes in a position
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.640]   where you have the highest percentage submission
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.480]   in the sport, so obviously you're gonna get
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.520]   a lot of submissions.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.880]   My issue with it is it is a rule set
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.280]   that allows somebody that's overall worse at jiu-jitsu
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.680]   to win a match.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.720]   A guy can go out there and just stall
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.520]   and just get completely dominated
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.440]   for the entirety of regulation
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.040]   and then he gets to start on the guy's back.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.000]   So that's my one issue with it.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.680]   - But also, I mean, it's interesting to see
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.960]   the best people in the world have to be put
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.240]   in a really bad position to see how good their escapes are,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   for example.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.600]   It's interesting, but it doesn't feel realistic.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.800]   It's a fun thing to watch,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.160]   but it doesn't feel like the real fight.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.760]   It feels weird.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.960]   - I'll claim it if I start an overtime on someone
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.040]   and finish him, I'll claim it,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.440]   but if they submit me an overtime, I'm like,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.560]   "Awesome, it's not a real submission."
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.400]   - It's good.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   (laughing)
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.960]   The issue is people stalling to just win the overtime.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.920]   So where you got this guy,
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.440]   his whole training camp is just not get subbed
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.880]   and win the overtime.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.560]   It's a bit boring.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.520]   - By the way, I have a rose behind you.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.280]   Somebody gave me a Valentine's flower.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.080]   So if you missed the one from Gordon, I got one for you.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.200]   - Well, I'd appreciate that.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.040]   Thank you.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.880]   (laughing)
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.760]   It's good to feel loved.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.600]   - Yeah.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.440]   All right.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.680]   So what did you learn from that match?
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.440]   Like takeaways, technically speaking,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.880]   like what do you need to work on?
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.080]   - Well, I learned that I am pretty good.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.760]   (laughing)
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.440]   Yeah, pretty good.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.520]   I got a few, I know exactly what my weakness is.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.120]   It's the leg lock department and I'm doing a lot
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.800]   to get better in that specific aspect.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.240]   - Attack and defense?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.800]   - I would say, yeah, attack, defense, re-attacks.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.320]   Even if I wanted to offensively enter a leg,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.480]   I could use some work there as well.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.280]   But I feel like once I solidify,
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.320]   like if I become a black belt specifically
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.640]   in the leg lock department,
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.240]   I feel like I'd be unstoppable.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.760]   - If you, Nicky Rod, definitively beat Gordon Ryan,
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.200]   how would you do it?
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.240]   - Buggy choke.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.360]   - Buggy choke.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.560]   - Buggy choke?
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.480]   For the listener,
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.760]   I don't even know how to describe buggy choke.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.600]   What's the definitive conclusion on that choke?
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.440]   Does it work?
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.160]   - It's a choke that you do when you're in a,
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.200]   what's the opposite of a dominant?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.160]   It's not submissive.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.480]   In a non-dominant position of bottom of side control.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.040]   - Yeah, just an embarrassing submission
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.200]   to get caught with, really.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.600]   - Yeah, but does it work?
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.360]   - It works on certain people.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.480]   (laughing)
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   - For the listener, you go ask that word, Nicky Rod.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.120]   It's embarrassing, but it's also, what,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.360]   it's a way to frustrate the opponent.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.080]   - For sure, yeah, it's a new part of the sport.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.200]   I feel like the Rotolo's brought it back into fashion
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.680]   and even if you don't get it,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.960]   because it's one of those moves that's so embarrassing,
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.840]   at the first sign of danger, the top guy abandons ship
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.640]   and you can basically retain guard
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   by attempting a very embarrassing submission.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.160]   - So the threat of embarrassment.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.080]   - Yeah, yeah. - That's everybody.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.400]   - People pull out very quick
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.280]   to avoid suffering the consequences.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.720]   - I think some people underestimate
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.120]   how good of a submission it is.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.840]   I mean, once you're locked in there,
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.320]   there's not too many defenses for a buggy choke.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.440]   - Is there an instructional on the way from you?
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   - J-Rod actually, my little brother has one.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.280]   - Oh yeah, for real?
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.000]   You actually legit have, oh, wow.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.240]   That's awesome, I'll check it out.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.160]   So I mean, you're making a joke out of it,
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.400]   but it is a real, there's a system to it.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.440]   - I mean, yeah, I don't know if we call it a system.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.840]   (laughing)
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.160]   It's a good move.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.600]   - I mean, you take an opponent
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.440]   that was just winning in a greatly dominant position,
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.960]   and then boom, in that same position,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.480]   they're pretty much, they're losing.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.320]   It's an interesting move.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.560]   - What's the name of the, what's the name of it?
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.040]   - It's called the Buggypedia, like J-Rodriguez.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.080]   - Okay, the Buggypedia.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.960]   I thought there'd be something
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.800]   like very Craig Jones-y about it.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.080]   Okay, awesome.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.040]   I know you don't wanna sort of reveal the secrets
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   of what you're working on, but in general,
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.200]   what does it take to beat Gordon, I guess, is the question.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.360]   - It would have to be some kind of a choke.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.600]   I think any joint lock or anything like that,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.080]   he's just gonna let it break and stay in the match.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.480]   So I don't even think he'd tap from a renegade choke.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.280]   I think I would have to put him to sleep.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   So putting him to sleep is how I would win.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.680]   - So Gordon is somebody who really hates losing.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.240]   - Yeah, he wouldn't even tap in the practice room.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.280]   I remember I had a toehold a couple times in practice room,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.080]   and he was just comfortable working there.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.080]   I'm like, I'm not really putting much on it.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.480]   I think he just, maybe because of situations like that
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.840]   in practice, he kind of didn't respect my toehold's ability
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.600]   in the competition.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.280]   - You've done that to me in the practice.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.240]   - I have, yeah.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.080]   Yeah, I gave you a little--
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   - Gave me a little pop, and then he let go.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.920]   (laughing)
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.600]   - And that was only 10% right there.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.080]   - Hey, don't get into math.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.840]   (laughing)
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.600]   - Okay, is there some part of that you think is necessary
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.040]   to be a champion, is to like, this almost unwillingness
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.720]   in competition to tap?
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   - I think there's definitely something to be said
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.480]   for people that are just like, you know,
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.920]   willing to go that extra mile or to take that damage
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.600]   to secure their victory.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.920]   - Is there a part of you that like, would hate to tap
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.200]   or hates to tap?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.360]   - Yeah, I mean, all of me, I would hate that.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.960]   Yeah, the whole part of me.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.440]   - Isn't there a John Legend song like that?
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.200]   All of you and all of me?
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.040]   - Very romantic, yeah.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.560]   - Yeah, we're sticking on that theme.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.400]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   Oh, one of the things Gordon asked,
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.640]   I forget how he put it because I think there's a lot
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.520]   of words that would need to be censored involved,
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   but he said, ask them how it feels to have a zero five
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.440]   record against me with four submissions combined.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.720]   - I mean, first of all, I wasn't sure he could count to five.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.560]   - Yeah.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.400]   - That's an impressive thing.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.240]   - That's impressive.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.080]   (laughing)
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.720]   - Oh, and five, I mean, I will say one thing,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.240]   nobody beats me four times.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.480]   (laughing)
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.360]   - I love you so much, Craig.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.120]   - Lex, I did have a question.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.680]   I did have a question for you.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.960]   (laughing)
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.120]   There was some controversy on your Twitter
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.160]   about a list of books.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.000]   - Yeah.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.960]   - And I was wondering why Gordon's book
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.360]   wasn't featured amongst that literature.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.000]   - Well, it was only the first 30 books
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.240]   or like the first 20 books, and it would of course be in--
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.400]   - Something interesting about Gordon,
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.000]   he's the first author that's written more books
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.840]   than he's read.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.360]   - Pretty good.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.800]   (laughing)
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.840]   If you face him and beat him,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.320]   like what's your take on what it takes to beat Gordon?
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.600]   I mean, you guys kind of joke
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.440]   and you go pretty hard recently on each other,
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.400]   but as a fan of jujitsu, I'm all in on this rivalry.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.680]   It's just fun to watch.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.520]   - I mean, first of all,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.840]   I don't think I go really hard with him.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.400]   I think Gordon is, he's pretty sensitive.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.120]   He's looking for a large insult in a small insult.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.320]   And for me, like Australians,
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.360]   we just attack each other all day, every day.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.680]   And for me, like if I see someone
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.840]   that takes himself very seriously,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.360]   that's like blood in the water.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.200]   That's funny to me.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.680]   To me, if I can just gently provoke
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.480]   and get a strong reaction, that's hilarious.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.680]   Like Aussies, we will just attack each other
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.200]   and the first person that gets upset,
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   he kind of loses the exchange.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.520]   So I think that is very, very entertaining.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.160]   - Like if you were to beat Gordon,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   would the mental game off the mat be part of it?
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.480]   - I think it would be a factor for sure.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.760]   But I mean, I'm never gonna come out
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.000]   too crazy direct with him.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.720]   You know, like I find that like if you get too upset
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.760]   on the line and you're going crazy,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.360]   I find that I'd be embarrassed to do that myself.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.680]   Obviously everyone's different.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.560]   Everyone has a different style, you know?
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.000]   But like, yeah, I think mental,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   the mental aspect would play a big factor.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.440]   I mean, mainly, because if I were to beat him,
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.160]   I would send him a message every day until I died,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.200]   just to gently remind him that I got the last one.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.440]   The last one is all that matters.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.760]   We're not giving it to him.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.840]   We're not giving it to him.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.720]   - So like once you beat him,
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.840]   you're going to run for the rest of your life?
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.160]   - I mean, run, but look back.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.560]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.080]   What message is it?
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.280]   - A sidestep.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.740]   - Ride your horse into the sunset, okay.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.040]   - Oh, by the way, you've talked very lightly.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.080]   You've talked shit very lightly
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.280]   against Alexander Volkanovsky's opponent, very lightly.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.560]   Have you received death threats or how are you still alive?
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.000]   - Like Gordon, I would say people from Dagestan
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.600]   take a joke very well.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.000]   - Do they really?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.840]   - No.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.400]   - Oh, like Gordon, oh, like, I'm sorry.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.240]   I'm slow.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.080]   (laughing)
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.040]   I went into aggressive mode in my head.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.280]   - Now, honestly, Islam is pretty cool.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.920]   I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know,
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.840]   'cause like I felt like that was a massive fight
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.040]   and it probably should have had more attention
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.000]   than it was receiving.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   So I wanted to just gently stir it up a bit.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.520]   I feel like Sambo guys are in the same vein
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   as catch wrestlers, very sensitive.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.000]   You know, like obviously there's only three people
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.120]   in the world that do catch wrestling, Sambo,
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.360]   maybe 10 to 15.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.080]   So I figured we could really provoke them
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.880]   with that sort of Jiu-Jitsu Sambo stuff.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.460]   Islam took the jokes very well.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.160]   The Russian fans, not so much, are very serious.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.120]   There's not many smiles in Russia, you know.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.200]   They didn't take it as well.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.480]   - I'm trying to suppress the anger,
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.500]   the rage is building up inside me slowly.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.800]   So you guys mentioned steroids.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.680]   - I like that you bring that up
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.040]   after we talk about Russia, for the record.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.680]   Smooth, smooth segue there.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.960]   (laughing)
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.360]   - I cannot condone the statements said by the Aussie,
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.840]   but I would love to travel with you to Russia.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.080]   - That would be a good time.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.040]   You might get killed with me now.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.960]   - No, I would be the first to turn to backstabbing.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.160]   (laughing)
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   - You're like, I got in there, get in.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.000]   - All right.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.920]   Are most of the top grapplers on steroids?
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.200]   - I mean, it's hard to say.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.640]   You know, some people look like shit and they're on steroids.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   Some people look excellent and they're not on steroids.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.800]   It's so, so hard to tell.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.920]   - That seems to be the general consensus
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.080]   that a lot of people are on steroids.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.800]   I'm always a little bit, I don't know.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.640]   So, I'll be honest, I've never seen anyone take steroids.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.000]   I've never taken steroids.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.200]   I don't even know if that's the right term to use
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.120]   or like TRT, any of that.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.680]   So, I'm very careful to not let my naivete
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.960]   lead me to take conclusions.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.160]   But I do feel a little bit weird
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.200]   about the witch hunt nature of it.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.240]   Some people a little bit too eagerly claim
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.880]   that others are on steroids
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.480]   just because they're successful.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.080]   But at the same time, it does seem that a lot of athletes
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.680]   will do whatever it takes to be successful.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.600]   - Yeah, I mean, if a sport doesn't test,
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.640]   you got to assume most people are gonna do it.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.600]   And especially now, as more money comes into the sport,
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.680]   you got to assume more people are gonna do it, you know?
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:25.600]   - I generally like do AGCC and like does Jiu-Jitsu test?
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.080]   - It's actually encouraged.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:27.920]   - What's encouraged?
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.520]   (laughing)
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.960]   You get a pamphlet, okay.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.800]   They don't test?
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.640]   There's no testing procedure?
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.880]   - They test to make sure we're on steroids
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.120]   'cause obviously it's a big show
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.000]   for the UFC, Fight Pass in the future.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:37.840]   (laughing)
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.520]   They don't want anyone coming in out of shape.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.440]   - Very nice.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.760]   Do you think using steroids in that kind of context
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.320]   in sports is wrong?
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.040]   Like stepping away, if it's not illegal?
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:47.880]   - I mean, from my perspective--
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.040]   - Do you think ethically speaking?
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.480]   - I like to assume everyone's on steroids
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.640]   so I don't have to feel bad about using steroids myself.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.400]   (laughing)
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.240]   Do you use all of the steroids?
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.760]   - I'm over 30, it's DRD, you know?
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.120]   That's the medical definition.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.440]   (laughing)
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.760]   - That's the medical, okay.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.480]   (laughing)
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.320]   I'd like to meet your doctor.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.760]   - Therapeutic use, you know?
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.080]   - Therapeutic, right.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.360]   Like how do you just feel about it?
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.760]   - I mean, it is cheating for sure.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.840]   Whether they test for it or not, I think it is cheating.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   Obviously some people are gonna say,
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.520]   "Oh, fuck, everyone's on it.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.760]   "I should be able to get away with it.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.280]   "It makes it even playing field."
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.800]   You know, but it kind of becomes Russian roulette
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.160]   'cause it's like if one guy's taking a small amount
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.400]   and the other guy is taking a huge amount,
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.120]   he's gonna reap huge rewards in the short term,
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.280]   probably be dead pretty early,
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.080]   but die a champion, mind you.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:35.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.240]   So it's like, I don't know what that one is.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.360]   - Yeah, what do you think about that?
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.440]   Do you think it's worthy to take health risks
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.040]   just for the glory?
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   - I think if you're 40 about to die
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.720]   looking at a cabinet of gold medals for wrestling other men,
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.360]   it's probably not gonna hit the same way
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.760]   on your death bed, you know?
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.840]   - Sorry, in which direction?
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.280]   Like is that a good thing or not?
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.480]   - No, you're probably gonna feel like,
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.280]   "Oh fuck, I probably wasted a bit of health on that."
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.120]   - You think so?
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.000]   Isn't that like the glory of it?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.800]   Like you said other men, yeah.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.280]   - Well, I mean, in my opinion,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.760]   maybe wrestle a woman as well.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.480]   - What'd you do with Gabby on Valentine's Day?
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.000]   What did you take her?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   - We filmed some new stuff for OnlyFans.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.080]   - For OnlyFans.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.440]   - We never stopped working.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.800]   (laughing)
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.200]   - Says the love affair is also a work affair, okay.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.040]   - I don't know.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.200]   There's something too that me like,
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.280]   like Olympic gold medalists accomplishing like the heights,
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.880]   like sacrificing everything, just everything.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.680]   The first 20, 30 years of your life
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.640]   for this silly little piece of metal.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.440]   I think there's something beautiful to that.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.400]   That's like conspires a lot, a lot of people.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:53.400]   And that's like the height of the human condition in a way.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.600]   - What if you survive?
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.280]   I'm just saying if you're in your deathbed early in life-
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.680]   - We all die.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.200]   All men die, Jones, but not all men truly live.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.640]   - How many years are you willing to shave off
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.160]   for a gold medal?
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.240]   - That's a good question.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.080]   How many?
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.120]   How many are you willing to shave off for a gold medal?
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   What you're for a silver medal?
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.480]   - For a silver, I mean, for a silver medal,
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.400]   I'd shave a few off.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.920]   - I think two silvers makes a gold.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.400]   (laughing)
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.600]   - It's worth five years?
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.120]   - Five to 10, maybe.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.200]   Shave off the bad years, enhance the good ones.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.320]   - Well, I mean, you've sacrificed.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.600]   You guys sacrificed a lot, a lot of your life.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.440]   You continue to sacrifice.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.280]   You don't see it as sacrifice.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.120]   - It's fun.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.640]   I think training's fun being a bit adamant about it,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.760]   consistent, gives you, I mean,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.040]   I think we have a great routine, great ritual.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.660]   Definitely enjoy the process.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.720]   - All right, well, do you guys know,
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.880]   this is bro science, or I'm talking bro scientists,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.480]   but do you know how long steroids stay in your system?
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.880]   - Forever?
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.720]   - Forever.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.960]   - Oh, because it's like, once you do it,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.440]   you own it.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.800]   - Yeah.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.240]   Just the knowledge.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.920]   Yeah, all right.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.400]   - I think it's different for each steroid, right?
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.280]   I think some of them last longer than others.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.200]   It depends if it's a urine.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.840]   - You would think I would do a little research
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.880]   before asking these questions.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.600]   Why do you think most athletes and coaches
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.080]   don't talk about steroids?
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.820]   Like, why is it such a secret?
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.320]   Why is it so embarrassing?
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.640]   - I think they probably talk about it
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.720]   like amongst the team and whatnot.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.000]   Again, I mean, it's gonna be more shady
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.880]   if it's like your sport is tested or whatnot.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.560]   Or kind of in the wild west, in the grappling world.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.400]   - Yeah, but why don't grapplers talk about it?
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.960]   Because it seems cheating.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.120]   - I mean, it's kind of insinuated as a bit of cheating,
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.400]   even if it's not tested.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.000]   I mean, still, you're taking a person that could,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.920]   maybe has good jiu-jitsu, good mechanics,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.200]   you're putting them on the leg,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.480]   and they're something with a heel hook
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.760]   versus breaking your leg with a heel hook.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.920]   Something as subtle as that can make big differences.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.800]   - All right, this is gonna make me sound dumb,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.680]   but is it possible that steroids
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.880]   are not a huge help in grappling?
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.680]   - I think if you're bad at jiu-jitsu and you do steroids,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.400]   you're gonna continue to be bad at jiu-jitsu.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.800]   But if you're great at gear,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.360]   I'm sorry, if you're great at grappling,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.520]   if you're great at grappling and then you also do gear,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.480]   it's gonna enhance what you're already good at
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.320]   and make you much better.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.680]   - But like how much is the enhancement,
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.840]   I guess is the question.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.800]   - How much is muscle valued?
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.960]   - Right, that's the question.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.800]   - If you're doing gear
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.120]   and you're not changing weight that much,
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.760]   like maybe it helps you a little bit,
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   but if you're gaining 50, 60 pounds of pure muscle
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.520]   and it's like, that's a huge enhancement,
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.720]   that's another human.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:38.080]   - Does muscle, a small human, yeah.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.040]   Does muscle matter in jiu-jitsu?
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.600]   I guess this is the question.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.160]   Is it possible that it gets in the way?
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.920]   - I'd say muscle matters, but technique matters more.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.560]   - I also think that it'll help you develop technique as well
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:53.160]   because obviously testosterone helps with recovery rate.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.600]   So if you're on gear, you're able to train a lot more.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.440]   Now, that being said, if you're not able to learn,
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.280]   obviously it's not gonna help in that aspect,
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.800]   but if you're somebody that knows how to learn
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.120]   and get good at jiu-jitsu
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.960]   and then you add gear on top of that,
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.160]   you're able to do significantly more sessions
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.400]   throughout the week.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.280]   - Okay, and by the way, gear is steroids?
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.600]   - Steroids, yeah.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.440]   - Okay.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.840]   I also think that you don't have to be as consistent
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.720]   in like your sleep and your food and stuff.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.320]   If you're on gear, you have a little bit of leeway,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.600]   but I mean, being consistent in your diet and your sleep
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.920]   definitely would help the process.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.800]   - Since you use most steroids of any athlete I've ever met,
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   do you think steroids help jiu-jitsu?
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.600]   - I think obviously it helps recovery
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.640]   and your ability to train more,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.720]   but I think some, I've seen some guys go on steroids
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.320]   and then suddenly they feel like the Incredible Hulk.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.040]   And now in the training room,
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.120]   they just start to rely more on strength
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.480]   than the techniques they had.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.240]   And actually in some respect hinders them
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.800]   and makes them gas more in competition
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.040]   'cause then they're using more of the muscle
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.400]   they never used to have.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.880]   - So you've implied that you're a natural athlete.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.160]   - You said that skeptically.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.000]   (laughing)
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.120]   Why are you skeptical?
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.600]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.320]   - Is this something you do for social media
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.960]   to talk shit to Gordon,
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.880]   to imply that he's not a natural athlete?
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.720]   - Well, I only pretty much recently on social media,
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.240]   I had this rebuttal, you know,
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.280]   saying that Gordon's on gear.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.800]   And I only said that because after our match
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.080]   in our most recent match, the EBI rules match,
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.240]   he accused me of greasing, which is like lubing up
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.320]   so I'm slippery during our match.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.160]   - And you did not.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.000]   - I did not.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.320]   I was checked multiple times before and after
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.840]   our grappling event.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.400]   And he still went out and accused me of this.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.480]   So I was like, all right, as opposed to telling a lie,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.040]   I'll just tell the truth about your steroid use,
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.800]   which it shouldn't be that big of a deal in retrospect
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.400]   'cause he kind of admitted it and whatnot previously.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.880]   So it's, yeah, I just kind of felt like I had to rebuttal
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.960]   and I didn't do it immediately 'cause I was like,
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.800]   all right, I know I have this podcast planned
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.280]   so I'll wait to do it on my friend, Mark Bell's podcast,
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.840]   you know, be a little more,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.680]   get a little bit more exposure on it.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.800]   And yeah, I knew he was gonna bite the bait
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.320]   but I didn't think he was gonna bite the bait that hard.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.520]   I know he's a little stressed out about the comment,
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.960]   but you know.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   - And that was the origin of you guys going back and forth.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.520]   - Well, it wasn't so much back and forth,
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.560]   it was just, I went forth and then he kept going back,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.400]   back, back.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.920]   Like I remember one of my guys, the enemy,
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.840]   and they were like, Gordon's made like 68 Instagram stories
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.920]   and 67 of them were all about you.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.200]   I was like, all right, well, I'm in his head for sure.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.760]   - Got us a few followers, we appreciate that.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.440]   - We did, we did get followers.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.320]   He even shouted out our B-team white belt program.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   So thank you.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   - Yeah.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.400]   (laughing)
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.240]   - Okay, speaking of which, what's the B-team?
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.080]   How's it run?
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   And why is it called the B-team?
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:57.920]   - Well, I mean, Craig-
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.760]   - Was the A-team taken?
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.040]   - I would have been.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.960]   For me, B's for best.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.760]   - Okay, best.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.800]   All right, what does B stand for for you?
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.680]   What does it represent?
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.480]   What is the ideal, like, you know,
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.600]   Miyamoto Musashi philosophical foundation of B-team?
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.760]   - Aim low and achieve.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.600]   - Oh.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.800]   If the bar is set low, you can't help but win, okay.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.280]   - That's Nikki's philosophy with women as well.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.560]   Set the bar incredibly low, overachieve.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.600]   - So what is the B-team?
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.760]   How do you guys run it?
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.240]   Like what, yeah, I mean, can you just talk about the school,
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.080]   how you found it?
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.920]   What is it, what's it like?
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.760]   - I mean, pretty much just a regular jujitsu gym.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.520]   We started as sort of a pros only, purple belt and above team
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.920]   and we have me, Nikki Rod, Nikki Ryan, Ethan, Damian.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.680]   As coaches, am I missing someone?
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.480]   Oh, JB.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.880]   - Your memory is with your old age.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.840]   - Impeccable memory, yeah.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.800]   And we got JB coming on to teach wipeouts.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.280]   But just your stock standard jujitsu team.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.920]   We focus on more, we lean heavily
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.120]   towards the professional athlete side of things.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.320]   We have a lot of high level guys in there.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.160]   - Yeah.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.920]   - Class structure, regular instruction,
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.440]   positional sparring, open rounds.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.760]   But we sort of took a heavy slant
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.720]   on marketing side of things.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.400]   We really try to blow up the YouTube channel.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.840]   Obviously we sell a lot of clothing, merchandise and stuff.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.760]   So yeah, we just sort of took a modern approach
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.160]   to a standard jujitsu gym.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.720]   'Cause I mean, jujitsu gyms are full
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.760]   of some of the most boring human beings on earth.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.600]   So we try to highlight--
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.920]   - Strong words, Greg Jones.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.880]   Strong words.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.320]   - Highlight the other side of things,
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.160]   keep it pretty light hearted.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   - That it can be fun.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.680]   - Yeah, that jujitsu can be fun.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.440]   I guess that it can be cool too.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   It's not just full of steroided up autistic people.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.200]   - Question from Reddit.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.120]   Quote, "Need to hear some of the stories
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.080]   "about drop-ins that led to the making
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.440]   "of the gem of a video,
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.920]   "the do's and don'ts of training a B team."
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.280]   Any fun stories?
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.560]   - Any ones that stand out?
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.520]   Do you guys remember any?
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.960]   - Police involved ever?
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.360]   - We had a guy come over to kick him out.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.400]   He was stalking two of the members.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.480]   Yeah, well, I mean, that's just crazy people.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.680]   - I portray a pretty insane image online.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.880]   And I guess I am that a lot of the time,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.800]   but at training, try to keep it.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.320]   While training, around training, I'm insulting everyone,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.520]   but while training, I try to keep it pretty serious.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.840]   But obviously the image I portray
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.640]   lures in some of the crazier members.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.440]   - I mean, like the thing is about the gym you guys run
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.280]   is really professional.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   It's like friendly.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.080]   It's like the light hearted joking is there, obviously,
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.040]   the, you know, like shit talk and all that kind of stuff.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.240]   But I guess it's a pretty safe environment.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.160]   But the public persona might attract some.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.520]   - Some maniacs.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.000]   I won't say which places I've trained at,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.800]   but obviously some places you walk into the room
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.240]   and it's very, very serious.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.520]   There's no smiles around.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.040]   Obviously it's probably average training room in Russia,
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.560]   but no smiles, very serious environment.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.400]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.080]   And I definitely don't like that.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.000]   I don't wanna show up to training
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.920]   and be walking on eggshells,
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.120]   not know what the coach's mood's like that day.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.760]   I wanna go in, have a good time, keep it light hearted.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.880]   - What was in the video?
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.440]   What are the do's and don'ts?
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.000]   'Cause like the address is public.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.600]   Like anyone can show up.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.640]   - Anyone can show up, yeah.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.480]   What were the do's and don'ts?
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.360]   - Does anyone challenge you like to a fight?
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.240]   - Not yet, not yet.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.280]   I mean, probably from other gyms in town,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.560]   that's probably coming down the line,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.720]   but do's and don'ts.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.560]   - I'm all in on that.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.800]   I would be excited as a fan to just watch.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.320]   - The love of the drama.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.720]   - Not the drama, no, no, no.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.040]   - Well, a little drama, a little drop of poison is good,
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.760]   but ultimately it's the best grapplers in the world
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.360]   kinda going at it, yeah.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.840]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.360]   'Cause maybe I'm wrong,
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.960]   but I think there is an underlying deep camaraderie
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.240]   at the end of the day
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.520]   when you're like at the top of the world
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520]   and you're like in the same town.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.000]   - What could possibly go wrong?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.120]   - It's like a shitty Western, but like an epic Western
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.920]   where like Clint Eastwood, like the good, the bad, and ugly.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   Of course I love it.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.800]   I'm here just eating popcorn like that.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.120]   - Staring the pot.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   - I'm not staring the pot.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:10.960]   I'm not staring the pot.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.360]   - These questions are from Reddit.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.880]   They're not from people.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.840]   - That one for sure.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.120]   - Yeah, I mean, what could possibly go wrong
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   if you're the world's best grappler, hates you,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.640]   and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.480]   Well, I mean.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.880]   - For sure, in Texas.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.720]   - And you've stolen his brother, held him for ransom.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.880]   - Kidnap.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.160]   It is like a story of a shitty Western, I think.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.440]   - You now allow white belts to train with you.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.600]   What's it like to open it up to a bigger audience?
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.240]   - We haven't opened it up yet,
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.360]   but it'll be interesting to see.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.080]   I mean, I feel like your higher belts,
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.360]   they really understand what the training room is.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.160]   White belts early, they're trying to find their place
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.280]   in the gym, could be kind of awkward
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.640]   and stuff in that environment.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.080]   So I think obviously those white belts coming in
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.120]   will change the dynamic,
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.400]   but the white belts will have a separate white belt class
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.640]   obviously for them, 'cause given it's such a high level gym,
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.520]   it'd be tough for a beginner to be able to enter
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   the more advanced classes.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.800]   Well, obviously we're teaching more advanced techniques.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.960]   So yeah, we've separated a white belt program,
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960]   I believe 6 p.m. on Friday.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.080]   Yeah, maybe we'll have a Saturday one as well,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   but it'd be interesting to see how it goes.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.160]   We're trying to do things different, you know,
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.720]   like trying to do your traditional,
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.120]   traditional gyms, obviously you're not gonna teach
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.040]   beginners wrestling at all.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.560]   We're trying to split it at least 33%,
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.400]   top game, bottom game and wrestling.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.160]   So at least create more well-rounded athletes from day one.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.600]   Whereas I feel like most traditional jiu-jitsu gyms
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.520]   might have no gi once a week, they don't touch wrestling,
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.000]   very IBJJF heavy techniques,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.520]   but again, the sport's changing for sure.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.640]   - Just to take that on,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.400]   how does a beginner get good at jiu-jitsu?
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.880]   Like given that you're starting this white belt,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.160]   what's your philosophy on that?
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   - Obviously buy all of my instructionals at full price,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.680]   not during a sale, that would go a long way.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.800]   - For those of you who are Russians,
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.040]   I'll send you instructions,
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.000]   or all the forms so you know how to steal it.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.840]   - Yeah, discount code.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.840]   - I'll share, I bought 'em all,
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.560]   so I'll just send it to you for free.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   - I mean, we do have the Makachev 50 discount code,
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.960]   you know, offering discounts to help him out for the rematch.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.480]   - I got the, nice.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.600]   (laughing)
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.720]   The Makachev 50, well, I got a 100% discount for you
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.200]   if you need it, but that said,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.360]   your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant,
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.800]   and it's one of the most respected instructionals.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.640]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.120]   - Out there, with incredibly great names.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.520]   - Yeah, it probably loses me sales, honestly,
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.720]   due to removing the seriousness of the text we cover.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.960]   - Oh, 'cause they think it's gonna kinda suck,
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.400]   it's gonna be some funny gimmicky thing?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.120]   - Or, I mean, some people don't even know
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.360]   if it's a real product.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.200]   (laughing)
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.640]   That's a big hurdle I have to overcome,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.440]   is they see it and they're like,
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.480]   is that a real thing?
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.320]   That's a problem.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.840]   But how does the White Belt get good?
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.680]   I think they just, I mean, they just have to show up.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.920]   Just have to put in the effort,
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.120]   try to focus on using techniques and training
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.160]   rather than just fighting to the death, you know?
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.680]   Although that is entertaining for us to watch,
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.240]   to watch White Belt fight to the death.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.360]   - Yeah, but what are the techniques?
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.880]   You should focus on, like, what's the process?
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880]   What does it mean to show up?
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.720]   Like, how much drilling, all that kind of stuff.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.040]   If you were to optimize the first six months of a beginner,
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.520]   there's a lot of people who would listen to this
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.200]   and haven't tried, they've been curious.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.680]   I have a lot of friends who haven't,
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.480]   who are like, you're just too curious.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.880]   They're constantly looking for an excuse to start.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.360]   - I think it's just gotta be as simple as possible.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.800]   You know, like, we shouldn't be teaching
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.600]   more advanced movements.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.560]   I mean, obviously, in the grand scheme of things,
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.400]   there's highly advanced techniques,
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.200]   and then there's slightly advanced.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.840]   And I think trying to teach those guys
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.720]   real specific positions, even,
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.560]   like real specific types of guard,
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.280]   it's just beyond them.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.320]   I think the best way to learn is through problem solving.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.920]   And I think if you show the technique
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.680]   before they've discovered that problem,
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.280]   the learning is sort of held back.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.520]   So I like the idea of using kids' style games
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.120]   to show them a problem,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.840]   and then use the techniques to fix the problems
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.120]   they've just discovered.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.720]   I think that's the best way to learn.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.800]   - Can you give an example of a problem to show them
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.120]   before you give them the techniques?
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:04.960]   Like, what are we talking about?
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.120]   - All right, so say you wanted to teach
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.520]   posture in wrestling.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.360]   You could create a game where one guy,
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.560]   the game might be get to a leg or get to two legs,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.800]   control the leg, like super simple.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.440]   But the rules, the constraint would be
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.640]   one guy is forced to keep an upright posture,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.760]   and one guy is forced, well, not forced,
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.600]   but he's allowed to keep a bent at the hips, lower posture.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.080]   And obviously within that constraint,
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.920]   the guy with the better posture
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.000]   is going to have more success.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.480]   He's gonna have a better posture to secure a leg
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   or secure both legs.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.000]   And therefore you've demonstrated the flaws of bad posture
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.880]   without having to explain it to them
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   before they really tested that out.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.240]   - Okay, and then the result of that,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.640]   you would realize that the bent over posture is better.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.360]   - Yeah, you have that aha moment
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.720]   rather than just having it spoken to you.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.400]   - You wrote, Craig,
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   "I'm a big fan of constraint-based learning,"
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.240]   I guess was what you're talking about.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.880]   "I love presenting beginners with a problem
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.360]   before the solution, like here,
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.680]   attempt to hold side control with no cues on how.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.600]   Then I see how the guy got out and address issue by issue,
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   cross face and hip control and so on."
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.040]   Okay, so what are some other examples like side control?
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.080]   - Yeah, that would be excellent one, side control.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.640]   Like teacher, like obviously we say,
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   oh, you secure a cross face so they can't turn into you.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.360]   Much easier to have them try to hold someone down
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.800]   without explaining what a cross face is
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.320]   and then use that technique to address the problem
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.480]   they've just encountered.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.160]   So I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jujitsu,
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.000]   like even more advanced, say 50/50,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.840]   obviously a mirrored position
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.240]   where you both have access to each other's heels.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.720]   Most people will stall out of that position
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720]   and keep their feet crossed.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.640]   I think a great constraint for both of them,
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.280]   you can't cross your feet.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.360]   Now you have to learn how to slip the heel hook
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.320]   when they expose it and how to safely re-attack of your own.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.040]   So the constraint is you can't be too defensive
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040]   in that position.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.680]   And I think the rate of learning increases.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.480]   - Why do you think the rate of learning increases?
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.320]   Like why do you think that works?
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.840]   - Because you encounter more problems.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.960]   Say in that situation,
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.640]   they're gonna get your heel a lot more
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.040]   in whatever period of time you allocate the drill for
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.680]   than if the legs are crossed.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.440]   I don't think the hard part is splitting the legs
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.720]   to get to the submission.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.040]   I think the hard part's practicing control
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.120]   while they're trying to slip it at a later stage.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.160]   And then obviously trying to slip your heel
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.000]   when you're in more danger
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.280]   also makes you more comfortable in that bad position
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.840]   if you're used to doing it with open legs.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.800]   - Yeah, I think that probably that style of teaching
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.680]   forces people to focus on,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.640]   'cause it's so easy to fall into focusing on
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.360]   like memorizing a particular details of a technique
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.200]   without thinking like, why the hell does this even work?
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.600]   And if you don't have that,
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.560]   you get to focus on like,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.200]   from like as cliche as it sounds from first principles,
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.360]   like why the hell, how the hell do I get out of this?
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.520]   Like, why does this even work?
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.880]   Why does wrestling work?
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.400]   Why do you have a bent over posture?
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.640]   You get those like, start to ask those kinds of questions,
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.480]   which is kind of interesting
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.440]   'cause it's not obvious to me that bent over posture
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   is the right posture for Jiu-Jitsu, right?
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.480]   I'm confused actually about that, I don't know.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.560]   - About the correct posture?
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.840]   - Yeah, for Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.760]   Like what's the right answer?
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.600]   - I think bent over posture is still good for Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.960]   - Even with the Judo and all of that.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.120]   Like why are so many Jiu-Jitsu people like at a high level,
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.240]   the posture is higher up?
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.000]   - Well, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.360]   because it's not necessary, right?
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.560]   If wrestlers are like low enough to the ground
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.320]   where your hands could touch the mat,
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.560]   but in Jiu-Jitsu, you know,
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.120]   it's kind of a mix between like wrestling and like Judo
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.480]   or Greco Roman wrestling.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.880]   So I think it's just a bit more relaxed
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.440]   and it's bent over, but it's not upright.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   And it's also not super low.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.480]   - Bit more room for error too,
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.760]   because obviously the Jiu-Jitsu guy's shot
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.480]   isn't gonna be as athletic or as quick as a wrestler,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.600]   especially a wrestler with shoes.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.960]   - So it actually comes down to the fact
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.720]   that Jiu-Jitsu people just on average,
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.560]   even at the top level are not good at shooting.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.400]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.880]   I think obviously, I mean,
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.640]   all the wrestlers in American stuff,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.360]   they're starting super early, super young.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.080]   They've, by the time they get to the same age we are really
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:14.920]   in our sport and stuff,
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.440]   they've spent much longer doing the actual sport
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.920]   than the average Jiu-Jitsu guy.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.160]   - And then there's another level of wrestling, of course,
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.880]   with the Soviet block.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.960]   That's just unachievable for your kind.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.880]   - Who knew an Australian rugby?
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.720]   - Yeah.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   - A former rugby player.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.480]   - Rugby, is that kind of like American football,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.640]   but much less money?
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.480]   Is that what that is?
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.880]   - Much less money, much tougher, I would say.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.680]   But who knew that the cure
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.480]   to the Dagestani wrestling were the Aussies?
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.000]   - Were the Aussies?
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.040]   Okay, let's go there.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.280]   (laughing)
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.960]   Your friend, your training partner, Alexander Volkanovsky,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.840]   you helped him prepare
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.120]   for the Islam Makachev versus Volkanovsky fight.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.040]   Who do you think, first of all, won that fight?
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.640]   - That's a tricky one.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.360]   - How is that the tricky question?
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.640]   - I will say when I was--
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.920]   - All the shit talk you've been doing,
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.000]   how is that the tricky question?
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.120]   - When I was in the corner going into the fifth,
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.000]   I personally believed live
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.520]   that Volkanovsky probably needed a finish
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.360]   to take the victory.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.120]   - But you have to think that way, right, in general?
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.800]   Or are you like legitimately--
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.320]   - It's a gray area 'cause the judging, who knows?
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.360]   Plus, I was like, "Wait, we're in Australia,
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.200]   "where's this bias?"
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.160]   You know, we've got some Australian judges here.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.440]   I was really hoping we'd get a bit of bias on that.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.920]   Unfortunately not, hopefully they lose their jobs.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.560]   But again, yeah, it was a close fight.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.520]   I think sometimes you're blinded in the moment
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.640]   because again, everyone counted Volkanovsky out,
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.000]   the crowd's behind him,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.880]   so everything he does is gonna get a huge cheer.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.400]   Your bias towards the smaller guy,
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.960]   your bias towards the underdog,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.240]   so you sort of, whatever the underdog does
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.680]   has a bigger impact in your mind.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.880]   And sometimes that can bias as the fight goes along.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.720]   But yeah, super, super close fight.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.480]   I would really love them to have a rematch,
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.040]   but obviously that's gonna hold up both divisions,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.920]   so I don't know if they'll be able to do it.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.480]   - Do you think they'll do a rematch soon?
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.320]   I mean, that was an epic fight.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.120]   I was listening to the fight companion during it.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.440]   - They all thought Volkanovsky.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.040]   - So they biased strongly the opinion?
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.480]   - Round two was the tricky one.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.760]   Round two's the tricky one.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.680]   - Anyway, I'd love to see that like run it back
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.160]   and do three actually.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.760]   'Cause there's an epic fight.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.840]   What was the brief conversation you had
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.320]   with Islam Makhachev and his team?
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.400]   - I didn't know how he would take the joke
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.960]   'cause obviously Khabib tried to flying eagle kick
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.360]   Dylan Danis in the face.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.880]   So I wasn't sure how my humor would go.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.640]   But I mean, Dylan must've said some worse things to me.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.360]   I was just playing around.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.840]   I mean, you can't really take anything I say serious,
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.160]   come across like an idiot.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.560]   But so when he was coming up to me afterwards,
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.520]   I was like, oh, I don't know what he's gonna say.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.000]   And again, maybe he would have been more upset
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.280]   if he had lost, but he just received the judge's decision.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.920]   But he came up, I went to check his hand,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.560]   he gave me a big hug and then pretended to throw me.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.920]   And then I thought the interaction was over
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.040]   and then he circled back.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:06.920]   So that's why it was so awkward.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.800]   I was like, oh, he's coming back.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.120]   He wants to say, he wants something else.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.400]   But he just said, why didn't you teach your boy
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.720]   how to escape the body triangle?
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.120]   - Oh, wow, interesting.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.120]   What did you say to that?
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.080]   - I said, well, I mean, obviously you've got to learn
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.960]   how to finish a rear naked choke.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.800]   - Is that what you said?
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.640]   - No, I didn't say that.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.840]   (both laughing)
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.240]   No, I was just laughing, I was laughing.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.360]   But then they ushered us out.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.200]   They were like, get out of here
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.960]   before the Aussie crowd attacks here.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.760]   - What do you think about the body triangle position
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.800]   that we're in?
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.440]   It seemed like for the first time,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.280]   it seems almost like Volk was dominant in that position,
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.480]   which is kind of weird.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.640]   - I mean, damage is meant to trump control, MMA judging.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.400]   Damage is the number one factor.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.160]   - Do you think the judges saw that?
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.520]   What did they score that as?
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.880]   - I think they all scored four towards Islam.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.600]   - Yeah. - Three and five.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.000]   Two of the judges scored towards Volk's.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.640]   One of the judges scored three for Islam.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.480]   One of them, it was 49, 46 for one of them,
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.560]   and the other ones were 48, 47.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.160]   I think that, again, the confusing round was round two.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.520]   I don't think anyone scored the body triangle round
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.240]   for Volk's, which I wish they had.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.280]   - Volkanovsky was and is still arguably
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.360]   pound for pound greatest fighter in the world.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.400]   How long have you known him?
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.360]   - I don't know the first,
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.200]   I met him before he was in the UFC,
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.040]   when I used to live in Melbourne.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.440]   He came down to train at Absolute.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.280]   - Yeah.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.560]   - And then we really connected on Ultimate Fighter.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.280]   One of these guys he was gonna bring to Ultimate Fighter,
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.280]   Brad Riddell pulled out last second.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.640]   So he called me when I was in Puerto Rico,
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.240]   and he's like, "Do you wanna coach on Tough for five weeks?"
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.160]   And like I said, Puerto Rico was apocalypse now.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.480]   I was like, "Yeah, get me out of here."
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.520]   So I jumped on that opportunity,
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.480]   and we were in Vegas five weeks together.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.200]   'Cause he was meant to fight Ortega,
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.360]   and then he got hit with COVID real bad.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.120]   Got stuck in, I think he was in hospital
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.880]   for maybe one to two weeks.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.520]   And then before he flew back to Australia,
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.520]   they were like, "All right, maybe we just do you guys
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.720]   "as the Ultimate Fighter coaches."
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.840]   So I jumped on board with that.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.320]   And that's really when we've become close.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.000]   Obviously I was useful in the Ortega fight,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.040]   helping him get out of submissions.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.680]   He fought then Korean zombie Max Holloway.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.520]   I basically just held the bucket at that point in the corner,
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.480]   couple striking fights.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.560]   And then again, yeah, we had to tackle the Islam problem.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.120]   So I did spend five to six weeks down there
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.320]   preparing for that.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.020]   - How did you tackle the Islam problem?
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.720]   - How do I tackle?
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.440]   - Was you somebody who barely knows anything about wrestling,
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.280]   having to help-
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.160]   - Obviously it doesn't take much,
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.260]   especially wrestling.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.160]   - Did the beard help or like what?
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.800]   In all seriousness, what were some of the key ideas
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.120]   that you worked on with Volkanovsky to prepare for it?
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.480]   - I had the help of Frank Hickman.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.400]   Hickman was down there too,
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.320]   one of the Hickman brothers wrestling coach.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.160]   So we were sort of like problem solving.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.920]   And I mean, basically we were confident
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.000]   in Volk's fence wrestling, his cage work.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.840]   He's super good on the cage,
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.560]   super like under-respected in that position.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.800]   And we knew that if you're able to take the scrambles
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.640]   to the cage, he would be effective against Islam.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.080]   'Cause again, Islam is background in Sambo freestyle
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.380]   wrestling, but I mean, honestly,
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.680]   he's probably got the same experience on the cage as Volk.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.400]   Obviously some of those wrestling skills
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.040]   will translate very well to the cage,
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.600]   but the cage is still somewhat of a gray area equalizer.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.920]   And Volk's again, incredible ability to stand up,
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.160]   incredible defense on the cage,
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.720]   which you saw we worked on strategies to get up
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.680]   and a ton of submission defense.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.200]   Islam loves Kimuras, obviously re-enact from the back,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   arm bars, those are sort of,
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.960]   and arm triangles, dominant submissions.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.560]   But again, the guys he submitted, not grapplers.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.280]   Apart from Charles Oliveira.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.560]   And again, Charles Oliveira was basically knocked out
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.400]   at that point.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.720]   So it was still impressive he submitted him.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.560]   But again, I always told people this,
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.440]   they thought it was crazy.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.400]   I was like, Charles Oliveira versus Islam
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.640]   in a grappling match.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.080]   Oliveira is gonna win that match.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.160]   - Like submission grappling.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.080]   - Submission grappling, yeah.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.000]   So in a pure grappling skillset,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.240]   I think Oliveira is a more dangerous grappler.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.160]   So we didn't even come into it thinking Islam
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.520]   was this unstoppable boogeyman
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.460]   that people make him out to be.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.880]   So we approached it from that,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.200]   just focused on the techniques,
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.680]   ability to get back up, using turtle to get back up,
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.160]   using turtle to scoot to the cage to get back up
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.000]   and hand fighting from there, keeping it pretty safe.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.560]   But what makes Volk so special, I think is his gas tank.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.920]   Gas tank and his willpower.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.240]   He's just unbreakable.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.160]   The Dagestani guys, Khabib, Islam,
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.920]   they are good at submissions,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.840]   but they break guys mentally and they fatigue him.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.800]   And then they take the submission that's offered.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.000]   Oliveira is a guy that can jump on submissions
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.320]   and have an incredible technical ability
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.240]   to finish those submissions,
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.580]   whether you're fresh or you're tired.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.120]   And then you combine that with Volkanovski,
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.360]   who incredible willpower, never gets tired.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.900]   You're never gonna break him.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.200]   And as you saw, he only attempted one submission
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.040]   the whole fight.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.140]   - Is that learned?
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.420]   Is that trained?
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.760]   Or are you just born with that mental toughness?
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.600]   - It's a good question.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.680]   I mean, he's like an anomaly.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.480]   Like the entire fight camp, not nervous at all,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.200]   supremely confident.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.080]   The whole fight week, completely confident.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.440]   He just has an attitude like,
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.140]   "Oh, everyone cast me out, we'll see."
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:14.980]   You know what I mean?
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.800]   Islam, he's like, "Let's see."
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.640]   - No doubt.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.040]   - No doubt at all.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.640]   Super relaxed up until about five minutes before.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.120]   And then he starts to amp himself up.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.040]   He's like, "You are not taking this belt from my family."
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.840]   He gets into that sort of mindset.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.060]   - He actually says that out loud?
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.240]   - You can't teach that survival.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.640]   He didn't even take a fight.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.460]   - Have you guys ever been pushed to the limit like that
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.380]   or broken in a grappling match?
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.600]   - I'll do it in practice.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.280]   I'll push myself to,
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.800]   I think I might pass out or die or something.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.920]   As far as how tired you get.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.760]   'Cause in a match-
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.000]   - You try not to ever get close to that in a match.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.280]   - Yeah, you try to, 'cause it's important to understand
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.520]   where your exhaustion point is.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.000]   But yeah, if you have to push to that limit in a match,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.360]   you're probably doing something wrong.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.480]   Like you see in matches where guys sprint the last minute,
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.440]   they try to win the match the last minute.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.160]   And it's like, you definitely had some mistakes
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.920]   leading up to that if you have to go balls to the wall.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.120]   - Okay, but has there been ever times in competition,
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.960]   especially early on, 'cause you wrestled pretty hard
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.380]   and wrestling is pretty exhausting.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.580]   Not wrestling, but wrestling style kind of thing,
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.260]   going against the best people in the world.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.780]   - Yeah, I mean, I definitely,
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.980]   again, I think in practice it's important to
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:40.500]   do that hard work that way competition is much easier.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.440]   I think if you red line in practice
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.560]   and you really push to death's door,
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.580]   then once you're in competition and you're working with,
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:52.840]   you're being fresh in a comp, I mean, it's much better.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.760]   - Have you ever been to that thing where Dan Gable
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.400]   talks about always wanting to be to a place
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.320]   where you can't get off the mat?
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.700]   Like you work so hard in the training room,
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.880]   you can't get off the mat.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.380]   I think he says he's failed at that in his career.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:08.980]   He was always able to at least crawl off the mat.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.640]   - Yeah, I definitely never like actually died on the mat,
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.560]   but I felt like I was gonna die.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.720]   - Sure, sure.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.820]   What about you?
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.660]   Do you quit all the time?
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:18.480]   - I get a light cramp.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.560]   I'm like, you know what, you got me, man.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.720]   Let's do this against him.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.840]   - If I'm asking Craig for a role,
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.340]   he's in the bathroom somewhere.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:29.680]   - Do you see the value of pushing yourself
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.360]   to that place where you're knocking on death's door?
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.840]   - Yeah, but within safety,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.400]   'cause obviously the most serious injuries occur
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.600]   when you're tired, over-training and stuff like that.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.900]   So I think like taking a page out of what
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.540]   those MMA fighters do, especially Vox with his training.
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:46.700]   Like he's not necessarily pushing crazy in each round,
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.220]   but he's doing extra conditioning, assault bike stuff,
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.140]   crazy workouts outside.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:55.920]   He does do some crazy training workouts, but all safe.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.760]   Very safe.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.720]   Like when he's redlining like that in the training room,
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.460]   it's a very controlled, safe setting.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.980]   I think to do that in jiu-jitsu
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.400]   against some of these lunatics out there
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.240]   that are trying to kill you,
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.280]   especially when you have a name, can be dangerous.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.420]   - So your approach to jiu-jitsu is don't warm up
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.100]   and don't try too hard.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.980]   - No, it's that.
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.340]   - For safety, no, for safety.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.820]   - Yeah, longevity, you know.
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.180]   - And talk shit about Russians.
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.640]   I got it, I got it, I hear you.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.300]   Oh, you mentioned cage work.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:26.100]   What's interesting to you that you learned
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.620]   over all this time about cage work?
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.260]   What's interesting about the dynamics of that?
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.340]   Are you talking about both like the control
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.340]   in the dominant position,
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.220]   but also getting up from the bottom
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.140]   while you're against the cage, all of that?
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.540]   - The added dimension of that cage,
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.020]   that wall being there changes a lot of stuff, right?
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.700]   So obviously in some ways,
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.580]   it's a much lower impact wrestling style
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.260]   because you can't be sprawled on.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.620]   You can shoot, the cage is gonna block their feet,
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:53.180]   you're gonna be able to chase down their hips.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.020]   It's just a completely different fight.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:58.420]   And again, because of Islam's judo skills,
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.560]   that upper body controls,
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.940]   you see he's able to use against the cage,
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.860]   like the inside trips,
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.780]   sort of the Uchimada style, Hara-Goshi throws.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.580]   So obviously those skills do translate,
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.540]   but yeah, I think the cage is a great equalizer
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.580]   for a lot of things like athleticism and stuff.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:18.580]   It takes away a huge speed advantage aspect of the fight.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.140]   - So he's really good at standing up.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.100]   What is there, I assume he learned all of that from you
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.420]   and your instructional just stand up.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.740]   - I mean, we were so confident.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.860]   I was like, you know what?
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:30.540]   Why don't we put this thing out a month before the fight?
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.780]   Maybe the illegal download hasn't made its way to Russia yet,
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.260]   but it was there for him.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.940]   - Can you explain to me what's in the instructional
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.940]   just stand up?
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.820]   Like what are the ideas?
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.860]   - What are you, I mean, the old school way to stand up,
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.220]   people talk about the technical get up,
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.780]   you know, the old Gracie, you put the hand,
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.340]   but I mean, that doesn't work.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.300]   It hasn't worked for 20 years.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.140]   You know, if you look at everyone that gets up in MMA,
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:52.700]   they're using turtle to get up.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.940]   They're using wrestling to get up.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:55.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.700]   Which is a counter to what pure jujitsu says.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.980]   They say, don't expose the back.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:02.140]   Don't ever expose your back.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.600]   I think jujitsu is a terrible way to get back to the feet
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.340]   because if you were to retain guarding a half guard
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.780]   or close guard, super hard positions to get up.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.300]   You're basically putting yourself in a leg tuck
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.180]   for wrestling.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:15.380]   So I think you need to borrow from wrestling
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.900]   to learn how to get up in an MMA fight.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.820]   So basically how to safely expose your own back
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:23.220]   while not allowing them to get hooks
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.540]   and use that to get back up,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.100]   or at least not allow them to get two hooks.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.060]   - And that applies for MMA especially.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:32.180]   - For MMA especially, because obviously striking
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.880]   is a factor, but if they are striking,
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.220]   they don't have locked hands around your body,
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.860]   means you are able to move.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:40.660]   You are able to make an attempt to get back up.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.660]   They have to choose between control, submission, or strikes.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.420]   - Post from Reddit, why does Craig Jones push so hard
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.420]   for a bottom is bad jujitsu?
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   What is so bad about playing bottom guard
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.660]   such as half guard or delahee?
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.660]   Those are the two options.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.940]   - No one likes a bottom.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.180]   - Why would I want to get up?
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.800]   It's the question for all of you.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.700]   Is the bottom a bad place to be?
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.920]   I mean, the bottom's bad
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.840]   if you don't want that guy on top of you.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.240]   That's the way I look at it.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.360]   - That sounds like something a cowboy would say,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.560]   but I don't know if that has much meaning.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.480]   I think the point of jujitsu is both are dangerous,
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.280]   being on bottom and on top.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.120]   - I think the longer the match is,
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.280]   probably favorites the top guy more,
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.120]   just 'cause every movement the bottom guy makes
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.040]   is probably carrying your weight,
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.720]   carrying that gravity on top of you.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.160]   So I think it's a bit more efficient
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.960]   passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.340]   - Bottom's reactive.
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.540]   Top is active.
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:38.540]   The top player decides how to engage,
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.380]   how to approach the guard.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.940]   They can use angles, they can use footwork,
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.860]   they can throw people, throw the legs by.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.180]   So it's an active position.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.020]   Bottom's reactive.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.220]   Reactive, you're going to get fatigued.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.180]   - Yeah, I think it's very difficult
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.420]   to gas somebody out while playing guard,
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.180]   but I think it's very easy to gas somebody out
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.740]   when attempting to pass it.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   - Well, you guys are talking about gassing people out,
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.540]   but is there more dangers from the bottom,
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.840]   like in terms of submissions
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.320]   and all that kind of stuff, or no?
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.880]   - I'm back and forth, 'cause I'm a top player,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.360]   but I understand the value of being on bottom.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.240]   When I do play guard, bottom,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.720]   I feel like the submissions come much easier.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.520]   And when I'm on top, they come also pretty easy,
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.200]   but maybe I just take a different route.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.240]   - Talking to two cowboys talking about you.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.480]   (laughing)
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.280]   - Top on the straights, bottom in the shades.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.120]   That's Nicky.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.560]   - What was the hardest part of the training
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.440]   for the training camp for Volkanovski?
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.180]   Like, you're just experiencing world-class
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.740]   MMA fighters training, and given your approach
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.460]   to jiu-jitsu of not trying too hard no matter what.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.580]   I mean, from my perspective,
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.220]   there's a lot of pressure for that.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.420]   You know, like, that's a lot of pressure
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.580]   for me to go in and think that I could possibly
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.940]   figure out a way to help this guy,
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.140]   address this guy that's basically never been beaten.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.260]   I think he got knocked out once,
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.860]   but basically not really even been put in bad positions.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.700]   You know what I mean?
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.520]   So that's a lot of pressure on me,
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.820]   especially 'cause Volkanovski's such a great guy.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:05.660]   Jiu-jitsu's different, you know?
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.780]   Like, you coach a guy who loses, he has time to tap,
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.140]   but in MMA, you could get severely hurt.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.740]   There's a lot more weight in what you need to do as a coach.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.040]   You have a greater sense of responsibility
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:16.980]   to their health and wellbeing.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.020]   You know, like, obviously I know Volk's kids,
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.620]   I know his wife, you know what I mean?
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:23.980]   They're putting faith in you to not just win the fight,
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.260]   but keep this man safe, you know?
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.380]   So from my perspective, a hell of a lot more pressure
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.560]   coaching him as an MMA fighter.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.560]   - So almost like the psychological aspect
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.620]   of doing the best you can for him.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:39.820]   - Exactly, yep, yep.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.920]   - What was the hardest about the actual training?
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.720]   Was it the technical aspect of trying to figure out
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.760]   the puzzle of Islam, or was it being a good training partner
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.640]   in figuring out how the grappling would work,
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.400]   basically playing your best impression of Makachev?
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.080]   Were you trying to actually impersonate him?
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.460]   Like, not just visually, but like in style.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.540]   - Yeah, definitely, definitely visually.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.540]   - You're not as good looking, but go ahead.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.940]   - Yeah, a little taller, but no.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.540]   In terms of the training, yeah, I mean,
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.180]   Islam's known as incredibly strong guy,
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:15.780]   so obviously I'm heavier than Islam,
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.380]   so theoretically I should be able to replicate
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.480]   that strength difference.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.940]   And then in terms of grappling,
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.200]   targeting those submissions that Islam does,
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.440]   like focusing on those in the training room,
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.740]   focusing on the way he holds half guard,
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.780]   and really, in the grappling sense,
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:32.060]   trying to replicate him on the ground,
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.700]   and then, yeah, I wrestle with him on the wall a ton,
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.980]   trying to replicate, obviously to the best of my ability,
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.020]   a lot of the stuff he does on the wall.
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:42.660]   Body lock heavy, inside trip, uchi matas,
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.380]   and just constantly putting the work on Vox,
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.220]   you know what I mean?
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:49.180]   Like constantly chaining attacks against him,
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.020]   really replicate that.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:52.260]   - As he's trying to get up and escape
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.540]   and all that kind of stuff, so the submissions,
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.200]   like both judo and submissions, just attack and attacking.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.720]   - Exactly, and there's only so much you can do, really,
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.180]   'cause obviously he's been,
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.820]   I think he's been fighting a long time,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.280]   so it's like you're trying to polish
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.000]   what he already is good at.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.400]   You can't just completely create entirely new game for him
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.160]   in the space of six weeks.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.460]   So you're trying to take what he's already effective at,
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.540]   add to it, and luckily a lot of the stuff
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.920]   he's already very good at was easy to add to for the fight.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.280]   - Question from Reddit.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.240]   I'm very curious why other MMA fighters
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.840]   don't employ high-profile grapplers
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.280]   from B-Team and New Wave to improve their grappling.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.640]   That's from this subreddit.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.480]   By now it's clear that they are levels above
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.320]   almost everyone in MMA, simply because fighters there
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.940]   don't specialize in grappling,
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:40.860]   but it doesn't seem like fighters, even champions,
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.960]   get training partners from the most successful teams.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.440]   Why is that the case?
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:49.440]   From your experience, why doesn't Kabir call you?
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.840]   - You want now?
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.800]   - Nah.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.440]   (laughing)
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.240]   Put in a good word for me.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.480]   - Oh, I will.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.960]   (laughing)
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.560]   - That's all right, he takes a joke pretty well.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.960]   - Yeah.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.440]   No, no, you'll be welcome with open arms.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.960]   (laughing)
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.520]   - I think your average Jiu-Jitsu coach,
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.040]   MMA fighters have bad experience with Jiu-Jitsu guys.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.280]   Jiu-Jitsu doesn't have a massive place in MMA.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.000]   Obviously rounds, stand-ups, it's hard to submit people.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.960]   Your average Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.240]   doesn't know anything about holding a guy down,
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.320]   doesn't know anything about how to stand up.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:28.080]   So I think if you overly utilize that Jiu-Jitsu guy
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.080]   that hasn't had experience in more modern No Gi
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.200]   or training MMA fighters previously,
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.800]   it's gonna be a complete waste of time to them.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.000]   I think they're smart enough to realize that.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.880]   - Do you have, and do you guys,
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:41.400]   do you have interest in MMA at all?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.200]   Just not even like, well certainly just competing yourself,
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.560]   but like just understanding the puzzle of MMA.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been a fan of mixed martial arts
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.920]   for a very long time before I trained Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.440]   Personally, I'd much rather coach than fight.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.880]   But I mean, I'd fight somebody for a good check
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.940]   and I get to pick the opponent, have a proper camp.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.720]   - Okay.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:07.560]   (laughing)
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.160]   - I can think of a good opponent.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.340]   - Which dude was that?
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.560]   All right.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.320]   (laughing)
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.160]   Who do you think is the greatest MMA fighter of all time?
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.720]   Craig, we can start with you.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.040]   Just as a fan of the sport, as somebody who's been deep in it.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.520]   - I mean, from my perspective, after that performance,
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.720]   I'm gonna say Volkanovsky
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.200]   because he was able to decisively outstrike Max Holloway,
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.600]   one of the greatest strikers in the sport.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.800]   And he was able to hang with the wrestling
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.480]   of Islam Akhachev.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.120]   And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.200]   who has some of the most dangerous submissions in Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.960]   So I think, in my opinion, technically he's the best.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.680]   - So even though he technically lost,
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.920]   he still has a crown.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.240]   - I believe so.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.600]   Given the size difference, given he's moving up in weight,
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.280]   I think all those factors really.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.920]   - The underdog, everything, the pressure.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.680]   - Did you think he would be able to hang
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.720]   in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam?
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.560]   - No, no, no.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.160]   I was really surprised.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.560]   That's why my eyes, like, it's kind of funny,
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.120]   like winning at the end of the day,
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.640]   I feel like judges influence that.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.280]   Although I did think Australian judges
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.520]   would rob the other way,
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.640]   but I was assuming they kind of,
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.880]   somebody paid somebody and not enough maybe.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.840]   But in general, I just thought he won
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.120]   sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.720]   Like sort of go into the fire and survive and thrive
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.440]   and finish the last round strong,
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.120]   which is kind of like spiritually is what a victory is.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.360]   So I wish he would kept going.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.240]   Like-
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.280]   - Wumble around.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:41.960]   That kind of thing.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.840]   What about you?
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.160]   Who do you think, like, who are the fighters you admire?
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.880]   Like who do you think is the greatest of all time?
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.000]   - I think the fighter I paid most attention to
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.360]   was Jon Jones.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.400]   You know, he has a great ability
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.720]   just to mix the high level striking, high level grappling.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.000]   Although his, you know, jujitsu by itself isn't,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.920]   you know, probably isn't like, you know, super high level,
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.800]   but his ability to mix everything together,
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.760]   I would say he's the best.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:13.360]   And he's a fellow, you know, heavier guy, heavyweight now.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.720]   So it's nice to see, you know,
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.400]   how those guys move at that weight.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.000]   - And a fellow natural athlete.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.200]   (laughing)
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200]   See what I did there?
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.040]   (laughing)
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.920]   What about you, Nikki?
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.960]   - Yeah, if I had to pick a goat,
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.720]   I would probably have to say Khabib,
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.040]   just because he was undefeated
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.600]   and he had a very, you know, high finishing rate.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.320]   You know, very few of his fights
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.040]   actually went to a decision.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.120]   So he just, overall, he dominated
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.160]   almost every single opponent he went against.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.440]   - The dominance.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.800]   I mean, we've been joking about it, but Craig,
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:48.440]   what do you think makes the Dagestani fighters so good?
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.120]   Like from this small region of the world,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.720]   so much dominance has come.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.520]   - I mean, obviously the amount of freestyle wrestling
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.560]   champions from that region probably puts their wrestling
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.200]   above and beyond the best in all of MMA.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.800]   And obviously a lot of, even in the Olympics,
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.400]   a lot of champions out of there, right?
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.720]   So I think that skillset combines with them
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.680]   adding effective pin controls on the ground
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.200]   and jiu-jitsu submissions.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.360]   But again, I think it's that hard training.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.200]   Those guys like Khabib would maintain that pressure
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.680]   throughout the entire fight and break guys down.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.720]   Their ability to fatigue guys to a breaking point,
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.920]   I think is something they do best.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.400]   - I wonder what that is.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.320]   Is that technique?
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.160]   What is that?
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.640]   What is it about their upbringing?
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.920]   'Cause it's just that part of the world.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.320]   What were the Satya brothers
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.640]   with on the freestyle wrestling side
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.360]   to all the mixed martial arts people?
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.360]   Like it must be part of the culture also.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.960]   They must be doing something.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.960]   I don't think, I haven't seen a convincing explanation
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.960]   of why yet, of what's specific about their training,
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.900]   what's specific about their culture that creates that.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.640]   Okay, what do you think about like the flip side?
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.360]   Do you admire somebody like Conor McGregor
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.400]   who knows how to create a spectacle?
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.440]   You, Craig, who likes spectacles?
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.280]   - Spectacles, yeah.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.600]   I mean, I really admired early Conor McGregor
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.440]   'cause I found him absolutely hilarious.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.920]   You know, like I felt like that was peak banter.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.960]   I feel like he just took the American world by storm.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.440]   Aussies, British, Irish, Kiwis,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.440]   I believe we have a way better level of banter
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.680]   and attacking each other.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.320]   And it's almost too easy to pick on Americans
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.240]   to take themselves very seriously.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.740]   I mean, arguably even other parts of the world too,
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.040]   the far East of Europe, you know?
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.200]   - But that's the tricky thing with Conor.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.440]   I think he was, I feel like you could have gotten
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.040]   in the same kind of trouble
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:48.100]   'cause the Russians really took everything very seriously.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.880]   They weren't joking around.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.160]   - Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.520]   It's like, it's a bit of, I mean,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.240]   some things he definitely takes too far, you know,
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.920]   but I felt like early on he had the right balance
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.320]   where he wouldn't really cross the line,
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.080]   but he would do enough.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.360]   He just took it to another level,
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.320]   obviously later in his career.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.040]   But I think early on, a bit of innocent banter.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.240]   - He gets a lot of eyes on the sport though.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.380]   He's probably by far the most popular
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:16.040]   combat athlete of all time because of that.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.840]   I feel like you have to cross the line.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.520]   I don't think enough people appreciate
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.840]   the values he's brought by crossing the line.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.480]   - He's making a sacrifice crossing the line.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.520]   That's gonna affect him for the rest of his life, you know?
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.360]   - I see, I don't think so.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.800]   I think he can always walk back.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.680]   'Cause I think unlike, people might disagree with this.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:37.120]   I, well, yeah, I thought he always radiated a respect
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:41.560]   for the opponent afterwards and underneath it.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.840]   It felt like the same way you do.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.440]   When I hear you shit talking,
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.520]   I don't see a person who really means it.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.560]   I see a person who's having fun with it.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.500]   I always saw Conor McGregor the same way.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.340]   I don't know.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.760]   But people took it extremely seriously.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.760]   But I saw the respect, the common respect
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.080]   the martial artists have for each other
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.560]   that felt like it was always there.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.440]   - If you don't like that individual,
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.440]   you're gonna perceive what they say more negatively
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.680]   than if you obviously were.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.960]   So I feel like if you like someone,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.480]   you're gonna never think they really crossed the line.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.300]   - That's true.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.280]   So you're saying I like you.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.680]   That's why I'm perceiving you.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.960]   You're bullshit in a positive light.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.520]   Are there people that hate you?
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.600]   - I mean, some of the family members at this table.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.000]   (all laughing)
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.160]   - People that really get to know you all hate you.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.880]   - The fans love me, the friends hate me.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.680]   - It's a good place to be.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.480]   Keep your enemies close.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.800]   All right.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.200]   What do you think is the most important muscle
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.560]   for Jiu-Jitsu, is it biceps?
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.760]   - I think a strong back.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.160]   I think back one, core second, and then biceps.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.280]   - Okay, biceps.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:53.120]   Cool.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.760]   Do you legitimately think weightlifting helps Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:57.560]   It's kind of the discussion under steroids.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560]   It's like the muscle mass and strength
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.760]   and power and explosiveness, all of that.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.440]   - I think sometimes when we're at that upper echelon
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.320]   of competition, there's only,
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.480]   there's like little minute battles that you have to win.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.320]   And if you're relatively close in technique,
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.360]   then a lot of times a stronger opponent pulls it out.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.360]   - But it could be also just the limitation, right?
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.520]   You hold position too long.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.680]   What about for hobbyists?
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.120]   Do you recommend weightlifting?
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.640]   Like when you see people in the gym?
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.000]   - I always recommend weightlifting.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.200]   I almost see muscle as the body's armor, right?
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.640]   The more armor you have,
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.080]   the more damage you can kind of take
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.200]   and maybe recovery is a little bit better.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.480]   And I've always seen weightlifting
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.280]   as a means to stick to my routine.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.640]   Like if there's no point in lifting
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.760]   if you're not eating right and you're not sleeping right.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.280]   So if you kind of put it all together,
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.560]   then it's beneficial.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.520]   - What about you guys?
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.720]   Do you go to the gym?
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.640]   - I go to the gym, yeah.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.480]   Believe it or not.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.320]   - Do you go to the hotel gym
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.040]   to use an elliptical and that butt machine?
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.080]   - Yeah, I focus on the glutes heavily.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:39:59.920]   - All right.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.600]   (laughs)
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.680]   What about the injury prevention and so on?
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.240]   How do you train to minimize the risk of injury?
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.480]   You guys have all been pretty beat up.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.200]   You've gotten a major injury with the ACL.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.160]   - Yeah.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.800]   - So how do you train to minimize injury?
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.280]   - Probably not the right guy to ask, eh?
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.120]   - Yeah.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:17.940]   (laughs)
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.480]   - Actually, can you talk through your injury?
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.440]   Like what happened?
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:25.360]   - Yeah, so about one week prior to this last ADCC,
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.160]   I was wrestling with this guy named Kenta
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.880]   who was also competing.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.960]   And I went to go lift him from like a rear body lock
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.920]   and he hooked the outside of my leg
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.440]   and we just felt something pop.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   He felt a shift with his leg.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.480]   And when it first happened,
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.720]   it hurt for like the first 30 seconds.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.920]   And I honestly debated.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.400]   I was like, maybe it was just some freak thing.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.680]   I was like, I literally thought
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.920]   about continuing the session.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.000]   Then the next day I woke up and it was like super sore.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.160]   I was limping around, couldn't do a full squat.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.080]   So it pretty much killed all of my training
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.120]   for the entire week leading up to the event.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.960]   So I couldn't train or anything.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.920]   Messed up the cut.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:09.120]   Obviously there's added nerves with that too,
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.920]   you know, when you're not in the gym every day
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.800]   leading up to the competition.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.120]   I went out there.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.040]   I wasn't really able to pull guard
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.760]   'cause I couldn't get full heel to butt connection,
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.800]   which is inevitable with playing guard.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.000]   And I was very hesitant to shoot as well.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.480]   So I came out with the idea
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.720]   of just trying to use hand fighting
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.840]   to tire my first opponent out.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.640]   And then mainly look to get to under hooks or over hooks
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.840]   and do mostly upper body wrestling.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.280]   In the beginning of the match,
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.760]   I successfully got to an under hook.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.560]   I got to a rear body lock.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.520]   He tried to roll and I ended up in top position
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.880]   in side control, but it was during the no points period.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.080]   And then as the match went on,
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.240]   I gassed out and eventually he ended up taking me down
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.040]   and then scoring with two hooks on the back.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.080]   - So what's the injury?
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.160]   - Yeah, so I got an MRI actually after the event.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.280]   I didn't know- - So you waited,
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.520]   wait, wait, you waited until after the event?
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:06.720]   - Yeah, I waited until after-
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.000]   - 'Cause like knowledge or ignorance is bliss?
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:09.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.320]   I was like, honestly, I don't even wanna know what's wrong.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.120]   I was like, I'd just go out there, compete.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.280]   You know, I knew it was like the biggest event to date
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.120]   and I really wanted to do it.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.000]   - Did you ever think about not doing it?
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.040]   - It definitely was a thought in my head,
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.600]   especially that the day after, you know,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.120]   it's always the worst day whenever you have
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.200]   like a serious injuries the day after.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.960]   And I was like, man, I really can't do a full squat.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.520]   I was like, I don't even know how I'm gonna be able
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.800]   to do this.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.000]   It got a bit better over as the week went on,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.120]   but I was like, man, I have to go out there and compete.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.860]   I was like, it'll always be in the back of my mind.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:47.360]   Like, what if, if I ended up pulling out?
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.320]   - What did you think about this whole?
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.560]   - I thought it was just being a pussy.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.400]   - Yeah.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.760]   (laughing)
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.680]   Just slap him around, just yell at him.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.720]   - I don't think we pressured you.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.080]   We just say you make your own decision, right?
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:42:59.920]   We're just like, yeah.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.040]   - Is that a tricky thing to do?
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.120]   Like with a heavily, like a serious injury like this?
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.360]   - We don't know. - Yeah, well, we didn't know.
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.400]   That was the thing we didn't know.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.240]   Honestly, initially I thought it was,
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:11.640]   I tore my lateral meniscus,
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.240]   but that ended up not being the case.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.040]   It ended up being a full ACL tear.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.640]   I was actually super surprised when I got the MRI results.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.480]   So yeah, we didn't know how bad it actually was.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.760]   - What do you think about that situation?
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.440]   - I think Nicky's a tough kid.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.440]   And I mean, when you're so close to that competition,
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440]   you know, there's not many,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.680]   you don't get many opportunities like that
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.880]   to compete in front of, you know, 15,000 people.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.720]   It's like, you know, props to you for pushing through it
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:39.560]   and getting it.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.920]   And man, he had a close match
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.520]   with one of the best grapplers in his weight class.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:45.360]   And it's like, you know, a few adjustments here and there.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.680]   And especially, you know,
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:50.120]   if he was able to train previously leading up to that match,
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.520]   I think Nicky pulls it out.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.200]   - So some of the things you mentioned is nerves.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.240]   So there's extra nerves just because you're underprepared.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.080]   - Yeah, I mean, you know.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:57.960]   - Feeling underprepared.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.040]   - You want to go into a competition with, you know,
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:00.880]   the confidence.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.800]   I did everything that I could leading up to this event.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.320]   I trained as much as I could.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.160]   And then when an injury prevents that,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.000]   you start to doubt yourself more.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.320]   - How do you guys think about injury?
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.760]   How do you train, you know,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.160]   training with the best in the world,
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.880]   training to be the best in the world and avoiding injury?
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.760]   'Cause you've got, you tore your bicep.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.120]   - Yeah, I tore a bicep.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.040]   - Doing curls or?
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.080]   - Dude, honestly, I was bodybuilding, you know,
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.480]   for like seven years.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.320]   And no lie, I did, I trained biceps like most days,
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.680]   like almost every day in those seven years.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.240]   Pretty much I injured myself.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.400]   - That's so Jersey, man.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.960]   - Anything else or just the biceps?
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.080]   - Just, I mean, no.
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.600]   (laughing)
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.400]   Yeah, I injured the bicep.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:45.520]   Pretty much the day before a wrestling practice,
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.280]   I had like a killer arm day.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.520]   And by arm day, I just mean training biceps.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.880]   (laughing)
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.080]   Very rigorously getting a sick pump.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.200]   And I go to wrestling practice the next day,
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.080]   you know, pretty late, I should have been there.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.040]   I didn't get a proper warmup in.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.880]   And the first thing I do is I shake hands
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.800]   and I go to shoot a single leg and boom,
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   I just blew my arm out the first movement I did.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.880]   So just not being warmed up properly,
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.960]   in addition to, you know,
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.040]   having a very vigorous arm day a few hours prior.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.840]   - You hear that about warmup?
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.280]   So what are some lessons about avoiding injury?
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.120]   Training at the-
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.320]   - I would say number one is warming up properly.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.960]   Making sure your body's hot before you do hot stuff.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.520]   - Okay.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.440]   And what does warmup look like for you?
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.400]   Is it jujitsu or non-jujitsu stuff?
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.640]   - Yeah, just for a warmup in general,
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.960]   I'll do something like a, if I'm talking competition,
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.400]   something like a jog walk back and forth a few times,
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.160]   then a sprint jog a few times to get that heart rate,
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.560]   you know, up and down.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.080]   And then I'll grab a partner.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.840]   I actually just filmed a DVD,
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.520]   or instructional specifically on the pre-match ritual.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.080]   In addition to that, I'll, you know, grab a partner.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.280]   I'll drill some movements.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.640]   Typically I'll drill some bad things.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.600]   Like I'll start from bottom, bottom out,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.560]   bottom side control, work out from there.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.600]   And in pretty much like 20 minutes in,
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:10.000]   I'm hot and I'm ready to go for rounds.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.400]   - Well, what about you, Greg?
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.240]   So what's the way to avoid injury?
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.520]   What's the worst injury you've had?
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.360]   - What's the worst injury?
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.360]   I don't even know.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.000]   I'm pretty good, pretty healthy.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.120]   - Whenever you quit practice, I'm gonna have some mental.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.440]   (laughing)
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.080]   Has your heart ever been broken?
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.720]   - Oh, many times, many times.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.920]   But there's a thing I notice.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.760]   People that spend the most time warming up
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.120]   are often the most injured.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.680]   It's a strong correlation.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.840]   (laughing)
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.720]   - All right, you can't argue with science.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.520]   - I remember training with Oliver Tyser,
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.400]   Oliver Tyser would have a 60 minute warmup.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.800]   Surprise, surprise, always injured.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.160]   Very common.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.280]   I find that very common in the training room.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.920]   Now I think people, it's how they train.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.360]   Like if you, like me, first sign of discomfort,
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.160]   back pedal, you know, push through that stuff.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.280]   Go too hard, go when you're too tired,
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.120]   you know what I mean?
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.440]   Get too emotional in the role.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:06.200]   I feel like those are the times that I've been hurt
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.640]   where I just like, oh, I can't let this guy get me.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.560]   When I have that attitude,
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.240]   I believe it's how you train and sort of, obviously.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.080]   - What does this come from?
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.920]   Like positionally too?
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.880]   Like, 'cause you're training against some killers.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.560]   I mean, you're training with him
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.080]   and going probably pretty hard.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.120]   - If Frank gets a little tired,
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.720]   he's like, yeah, I'm good for today.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.040]   - Once a month with Nicky, that's it.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.840]   - And then you quit like 30 seconds in.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.400]   - Yeah, you know, you gotta be safe.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.240]   - I like it.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:35.080]   What about you?
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.320]   What have you learned from the ACL, Taryn?
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.360]   - Through rehab, yeah.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.600]   Yeah, rehab definitely would help.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.680]   - Oh, so you haven't been like-
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.880]   - I didn't get surgery.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.640]   I didn't do, essentially, any rehab.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.400]   I just have no ACL in my left leg.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.600]   - So what's it like having no-
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.720]   - The surgeon goes, you've got two options,
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:53.880]   surgery, rehab only.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.640]   Nicky goes, I'll do nothing.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.920]   - Definitely should pick up on the rehab.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.400]   - What's rehab for that look like?
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.360]   Like twice a day of doing some weird-
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.800]   like bands or something.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.640]   - It's good he's learned some valuable lessons
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.840]   about taking care of his body.
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.480]   - What's it like just training with no ACL?
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.560]   - So at the beginning, it was definitely a little iffy.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.720]   I would have an occasional buckle.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.080]   Like I'd just be wrestling with somebody
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.320]   and go to step back and it buckled backwards a bit.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.200]   But honestly, now, I haven't had a single buckle instance
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.040]   in a while.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.200]   It feels 100% normal when I train.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.040]   It feels better than my other knee, to be honest.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.080]   Like I had my meniscus taken out in my right leg
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.900]   and that one gets sore more often than the no ACL leg.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.740]   - Okay, all right.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:46.880]   So putting that aside, is there wisdom you've learned
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.360]   from that experience?
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360]   - Yeah, definitely should be doing rehab and prehab.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.080]   I think that, especially if you're a hobbyist
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.760]   or a professional athlete, you should be lifting,
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.520]   whether you're rehabbing an injury
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.360]   or just for injury prevention.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.320]   - So I'm actually closer to, correct,
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:10.040]   'cause I've trained my whole life, like pretty hard.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.200]   Obviously just a hobbyist, but like twice a day,
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.960]   did judo, wrestling, all that.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:17.020]   Never broke anything, never injured.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:21.600]   Kind of like similar philosophy, except like last year,
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.200]   I guess a year and a half ago,
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.160]   I got a tiny like groin pull injury
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.720]   and it still hasn't healed.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.320]   And I've been using your approach of not giving a shit.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:32.160]   - Yeah.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.200]   - And like, surely this is gonna heal.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.240]   It'll be fine, but it hasn't.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.080]   But of course, if I was like an actual athlete,
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.000]   I would like probably still train through it
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.640]   and just fuck it, figure it out.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.840]   But when you have other stuff going on,
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.640]   you just kind of wait it out.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.480]   - Yeah.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.880]   - But no, I think probably rehab,
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.960]   especially as you get older,
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.320]   you have to do that kind of stuff.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.800]   - I think it's important for people to, you know,
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.880]   determine whether what they're going through is an injury
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.400]   or they're just hurt a little bit.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.680]   'Cause injury, you know, for sure,
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.520]   take time, rehab it and get better.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.360]   But a lot of people like they'll stub a toe or something,
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.960]   like you're out for a few weeks, you know, so.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.600]   - Well, that's the problem with the injury I have.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.720]   It feels like a stubbed toe.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.720]   So I was like, "Eh, I'll just wait a couple of days.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.560]   "It'll be fine."
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.280]   And then a couple of days later, it's not fine.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.600]   And you wait, and then I never got an MRI,
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.760]   never got any of that.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.800]   It's like, I'm sure I'll be fine.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:20.960]   Yeah, so it's hard to know sometimes.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.520]   It's hard to know.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.040]   I feel like a lot of people will just not check it out
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:28.880]   and be fine.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.280]   'Cause there's several failure cases.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.520]   There is a failure case of where everything is a stubbed toe.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.720]   You're like, "Fuck it."
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:38.520]   Like you're bleeding everywhere.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.480]   Yeah, it's fine, whatever.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.320]   So you have to be careful.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.440]   A lot of people can fall into that too.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.600]   I think I'm in that category.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.440]   Go to the doctor.
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.280]   Why do you go to the doctor?
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.320]   - Your best approach is typically wait
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.160]   until something else gets hurt
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.400]   so that you'll forget about the grain.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.240]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.440]   That's what I was hoping.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.480]   I was hoping to get hurt.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.280]   Waiting for the broken heart, maybe.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.560]   - Okay, that was very helpful.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.120]   Oh, you mentioned you're doing a whole thing
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.160]   on the pre-match ritual.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.400]   Can you kind of preview what's involved
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.360]   in your pre-match ritual?
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.280]   - It's pretty big in the wrestling culture
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.120]   and the fighting culture,
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.280]   like kind of what to do before your competition.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.240]   But I think a few people are just kind of missing out
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.800]   exactly what to do.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.240]   So I break it down for them.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.280]   I break it down to people like four weeks in advance,
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.040]   how you should prep your training and your nutrition
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.200]   and your sleep for competition.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:38.080]   In addition to that, I break it down even to a smaller scale
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.480]   of how early you should get to the event,
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:46.440]   when you should be visualizing your competition,
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.160]   what to do 30 minutes before,
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.920]   20 minutes, 10 minutes, five minutes,
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.720]   and the kind of mentality you should have
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.480]   throughout those times
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.040]   before you actually step onto the mat.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.520]   - When are you visualizing?
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.280]   How much are you visualizing?
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.320]   When you say competition,
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.800]   you're talking about the tournament
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.200]   or the actual people you might be competing against?
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.040]   - A little bit of both.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:08.160]   I'll spend time just visualizing the crowd.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.880]   Like if it's going to be an arena with 15,000 people,
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.560]   I'll spend time in practice and whatnot,
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.840]   like putting myself inside that arena
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:16.800]   and visualizing stepping on the mat
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.040]   and hearing the crowd scream and whatnot.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.600]   That way, when competition time comes,
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.960]   it's kind of the same deal.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.080]   I'm accustomed to it.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.760]   In addition, when I get to the arena,
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:26.640]   I'll step on the mat.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.200]   I'll kind of look at everything.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.600]   I'll expose my senses to what it's going to be.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.240]   And then I'll kind of shut everything off.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:34.280]   Like some people, you know,
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.040]   scroll through their phone and can treat it like normal,
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.560]   have this normal conversations.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.920]   For me, I like to limit my sensory input,
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:43.680]   my sensory intake before I go out and compete.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.240]   I just feel like sometimes,
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.720]   I feel like sometimes we only have so many decisions
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.600]   you can make in a day.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:51.120]   And I want all of my best decisions to be made
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.760]   when it matters, when it counts.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.800]   - What about you?
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.200]   What's, do you limit your sensory input?
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.720]   - On game day?
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.680]   Honestly, no routine, nothing, eh?
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.880]   I don't know, yeah, I don't do anything.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.920]   I'm just like-- - This guy's a double silver.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.120]   - We're both double silver.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:10.960]   (laughing)
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:12.880]   - You should get it, you should buy his instructional.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.720]   It might help you.
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.800]   - I'll get another silver.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.520]   (laughing)
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.560]   No, honestly, nothing, hey, I just try to relax,
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.240]   treat it like it's before training.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:21.080]   Have a--
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.600]   - Try visualizations or no?
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.200]   - No, no visualizations.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.040]   - So the opposite of visualization, you just avoid it.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.640]   - Yeah, I don't even think about it.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.640]   I'm just like, yeah, we'll have a good time.
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.200]   Try to appreciate it, that I can do it.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:35.360]   - By the way, when you visualize,
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.120]   are you visualizing tough positions
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.200]   or you visualize winning mostly?
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.800]   - Definitely visualize winning.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.200]   I visualize how I can get,
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.040]   how I'm going to get to my most dominant positions.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.400]   'Cause in comp, I want to do what I'm best at.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.800]   And I'm also see, I see my opponent in his best positions
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.000]   and how I'm going to escape those if necessary.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.480]   But most of the time, I'm just visualizing
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.440]   exactly what I'm going to do in that match.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.080]   And I go out there and do it.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:01.760]   - Okay, so when your teammate, Craig,
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.880]   is another world-class athlete,
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.600]   has a fundamentally different philosophy than you,
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.160]   do you visualize being frustrated at him?
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.920]   - No, not frustrated, but I'll definitely come into practice
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:16.520]   with solutions to problems that Craig gives me.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.720]   If Craig's catching me at something or giving me issues,
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.320]   I'll go home, I'll watch a match that he lost
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:25.280]   for motivation and I'll come back and I'll put it on.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.200]   (laughing)
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.960]   - Just DM him like a highlight reel of him losing.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:30.800]   - Yup.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.840]   (laughing)
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:32.680]   - What about you?
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.240]   Does it affect you that you're a bit of an outlier?
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.000]   - Usually before I compete, right before I go out there,
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.720]   I go, why am I doing this?
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.480]   Do I still need to do this?
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.440]   And I think, hopefully it doesn't embarrass myself,
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.280]   affects my instructional sales.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.760]   That's the last thought.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.840]   But I don't even put too much thought
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.720]   into the whole competing thing.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.000]   I'm just like, you know what, train hard,
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:54.840]   hopefully have a good time out there.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.040]   - What about the motivation aspect?
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:58.720]   Like that voice that says, why am I doing this?
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.520]   That voice can break a lot of people.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.320]   Like in the weight cut, it can break a lot of people.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.320]   Like why am I doing this stupid, silly sport?
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.800]   Like you said, a bunch of dudes just rolling around,
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.840]   like what's the point?
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.480]   - I'll call someone with a nine to five job
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:13.000]   and I'll be like, yeah, that's why I'm doing this.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:13.840]   Avoid that.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.080]   (laughing)
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.640]   - Sell those DVDs, man.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.320]   - Yeah, I didn't get too deep on competing.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.160]   - Yeah.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:21.720]   - We're so polar opposite.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.760]   It's like almost uncomfortable to be around you.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.280]   - Obviously, one of us is a clean athlete.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:27.520]   (laughing)
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:30.320]   - You should do a DVD on that.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:37.040]   What about you in terms of preparing for competition, Mickey?
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.960]   The day before, the day of,
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.080]   are there rituals that you follow?
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.600]   - Honestly, like the few days leading up to it,
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.640]   it's different for me every time.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.320]   Like sometimes I'll warm up before I compete,
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.360]   sometimes I won't, sometimes I'll fast, sometimes I'll eat.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.200]   So it literally is just completely random.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.040]   I don't follow any specific thing.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.240]   But in the training room leading up to the competition,
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:02.720]   I'll definitely, like Nicky Rod visualized,
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.560]   that I'm walking out onto the competition mats.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.920]   I'll pick somebody that's a similar body type
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.880]   to the person that I'm competing against.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.720]   And then we'll start out with some distance between us.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.000]   We'll come out, smack hands,
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.440]   and act like everything's a real competition.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:20.680]   I'll even sometimes have corners that will yell out times
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:21.520]   and things like that,
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.000]   just to replicate it as much as possible.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]   - That's funny, because I've talked to a lot
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.520]   of Olympic gold medalists.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.400]   They used to do a podcast with like athletes,
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.720]   and they all sound like Nicky Rod.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.560]   (laughing)
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:35.000]   The two of you are outliers.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.400]   I don't know, sometimes I'll do this, sometimes.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.560]   So anyway, but that's also Jiu-Jitsu culture, I think.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.640]   Maybe the chaos of not taking things too serious
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.280]   is actually really, really helpful.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.040]   Sometimes the pressure of taking everything
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.920]   way too seriously can break you.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.440]   - I mean, I just don't think it's that big a sport, really.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.280]   You know, like-
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.600]   - I think if I compete every day in practice,
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.400]   it just makes competition much easier.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.000]   So I just put the pressure on there.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.160]   - On the competition, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.520]   On the, sorry, on the training,
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.200]   on the competing and the training.
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.680]   I don't know, Olympic sports
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:04.920]   aren't that big either, financially.
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.200]   And people take it extremely, extremely seriously.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.080]   Like you don't really get that much money from Judo.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.840]   - I mean, I just don't take Jiu-Jitsu that seriously,
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840]   'cause like I was just partying
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.160]   and having a good time until 21.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.160]   And then I was like, "Oh, fuck, do I get a job?
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.600]   Or do I pursue professional sports?"
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.920]   And I feel like if I can, made a career in Jiu-Jitsu
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.420]   with a decision at that point.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:25.280]   - And now you just stumbled your way somehow
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.080]   into like being at the top of the world.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:28.000]   - Yeah, that's what I feel like.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:28.880]   I just walked into it.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:31.840]   I feel like I couldn't just do that in wrestling, boxing.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.600]   I couldn't do that in other sports.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.400]   - What was the toughest match you've ever had
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.920]   that pushed you mentally, physically, technically?
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.760]   This doesn't have to be the best person you face,
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.440]   but was there like a moment in your career
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.440]   that was like really defining for you?
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.040]   - I mean, I would say like the toughest mentally
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:53.640]   was just this last ADCC.
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.760]   I just had a big injury leading into it
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.780]   that kind of screwed the whole camp
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:00.200]   and weight cutting everything up.
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.200]   So yeah, I would say the last ADCC.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:04.680]   - Are you proud of your performance there?
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.160]   Like you stepped on the mat that you pushed through all of it?
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.000]   - Like I said, I'm a very competitive person
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.240]   and I hate losing.
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:13.360]   So definitely not, yeah.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.760]   - You had a collapse lung.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.000]   (laughing)
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.960]   - Can we elaborate on this?
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:24.920]   - He was so physically exhausted afterwards,
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:27.120]   couldn't breathe, we had to get medical intervention.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.160]   He thought he had a collapse lung.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:30.000]   - So he goes-
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.640]   - I was the most tired that I've ever been in my life
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.480]   in that match.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.480]   I actually popped a blood vessel in my eye.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:37.200]   I was trying so hard.
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.520]   - He comes out, he walks off the ADCC mat backstage
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:42.720]   and I'm like, I'm kind of getting warmed up for my match.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:45.840]   And Nikki run and comes, he walks over, huffing and puffing.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.600]   His mom's right next to me, he looks at her,
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:49.440]   he was like, I think I need help.
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.920]   I think I got a lung collapse.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.760]   (laughing)
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:52.600]   - That's not true.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.680]   - No, that's not true?
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.920]   - My mom's the one that called for medical help.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.000]   I was just laying on the warmup mat, fucking dying.
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.000]   - Well, we're happy you're fine.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.240]   (laughing)
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.640]   - You laid it all on the line.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.400]   What about you, Craig?
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.560]   - Defining all toughest matches?
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.000]   I mean, they're all pretty tough.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.680]   I don't know, I can't really pinpoint one.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:18.080]   I mean, probably the most annoying one
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:19.760]   was obviously the one where I had Gordon Arnby,
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.000]   I was like, tap bro.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]   And he wouldn't tap, so I let him out.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.240]   (laughing)
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:28.760]   Mentally, I was like, I shouldn't have done that.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.200]   - Do you ever have a thing in your brain
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.040]   where it says, should I shit talk now or not?
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.960]   And you say, no, I'm gonna be respectful?
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.560]   - I just can't be serious about some of these things.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.560]   I don't know, it's just silly.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:41.840]   - All of it, the whole thing.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.120]   What about you, Nicky Man?
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:47.840]   - Dude, honestly, most of my toughest matches
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:50.520]   are in the training room, right?
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.840]   'Cause I started with these guys,
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.320]   I started training under them,
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:58.480]   started training at DDS when I didn't have any knowledge.
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:01.440]   I knew wrestling, I knew a knee cut in jujitsu,
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:02.800]   but I started training with them
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.920]   when I knew almost no jujitsu
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:07.120]   and then I had to really work my way up.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.680]   So definitely in the training room,
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.040]   being like having one of these guys on my back
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.880]   or there's a stretch of a few weeks or months
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.280]   when COVID first hit and it was just like
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.040]   four of the best grapplers in the world
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:20.520]   and we just did drilling and live rounds
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:24.960]   with these four guys and it was hard, it was very hard.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.840]   Every round, doing six rounds, seven days a week
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.240]   with the best grapplers in the world
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:30.600]   and it's like you get no break
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:32.520]   and you're forced to learn on the go.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.640]   So I think for me in the training room,
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.680]   that was definitely my toughest matches
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.200]   and that's where I built those mental calluses.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.920]   - There was a period where I drilled with Nicky Rod,
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920]   probably what, nine months, 12 months?
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:47.080]   And typically speaking, like I said, no warmups,
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:49.040]   the first round we usually take it pretty easy.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:50.760]   First round you start in mount.
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:53.560]   The whole room, the rest of the training room,
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.640]   they take mount very lightly.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:59.080]   Me and Nicky Rod would be fighting to the death every day.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.560]   I felt like we did an extra round every day.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.400]   It was very grueling.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.680]   - I'm very mean when I'm in the midst of drilling
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:10.680]   or live, we would drill wrestling quite a bit,
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:13.560]   like stand up and in the drilling,
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:15.720]   I just wouldn't let Craig take me down.
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:17.200]   We're not going live, we're just drilling,
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.880]   but I just wouldn't let him put me on the floor.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.320]   So things like that.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:23.200]   (laughing)
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.000]   - I knew it would escalate.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:25.880]   - Yeah.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.760]   - So you mentioned mount, so you do positional training.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.720]   So would that be the hardest versus live training,
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.600]   open, starting from guard?
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.080]   - I would say mount and turtle definitely,
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:37.880]   definitely made me very tough.
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:41.200]   'Cause you spend all this effort getting off of bottom out
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.800]   and then you got to get on top of a guy.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.040]   And at the time I'm not that good at holding guys down.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.680]   So they escape quick and I'm like, fuck,
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:47.920]   I just tried to hold them down.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.040]   Got to go back down.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:49.920]   Same thing with a turtle.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.600]   It's like you start bottom turtle,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.400]   you're trying to explode, get out, get away.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:55.240]   And then, you know, you switch
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.280]   and this guy gets up pretty quick and you're like,
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.760]   damn, I got to go right back down.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.680]   It was that constant circle, man.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.120]   It's very tough, but definitely, you know,
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.520]   build some character on the mat.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.360]   - What do you think is the value
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:08.080]   of positional training in general in Jiu-Jitsu?
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.080]   Actually, this one, just interacting with you guys,
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.780]   it's not commonly done in just like regular Jiu-Jitsu gyms.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:14.620]   What do you see?
[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:15.880]   'Cause probably it's not commonly done
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.780]   'cause most of the experience is just frustrating.
[02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:21.740]   Like if you're evenly matched,
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:24.480]   you're basically frustrated the whole time,
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.680]   if you're doing it right.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:27.600]   - It's a psychological battle that happens
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:28.840]   in like the mount and turtle rounds.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.200]   It's like, you know, 'cause you,
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.120]   maybe you get close to subbing a guy
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:33.360]   or maybe you do sub him.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.440]   You know, when you start on turtle
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.640]   and you're on their back, you finish them
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.280]   and then you get this high point
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.920]   and then immediately you got to go back down
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:41.560]   to defensive posture.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.200]   It's very like, it's emotionally like up and down.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.360]   So it's hard to deal with.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.000]   - Super important if you're one of the better people
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.560]   in the gym, because it just puts you in positions
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.200]   you don't find yourself in, in regular training.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:54.140]   So I think like a lot of,
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.520]   if you're a big fish in a small pond
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.880]   and you don't do positional sparring,
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:59.240]   you're probably going to get exposed in competition.
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:01.160]   You might even look silly in those positions.
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.360]   So you really have to force yourself to do it,
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.840]   despite the fact that you're giving someone
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.200]   worse than you a position where they might catch you.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.340]   So you have to sort of put the ego aside.
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.440]   - Yeah, that's one of the things
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:13.760]   when I was training regularly,
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:15.600]   of course, training with you guys, it's like trivial,
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:20.280]   but I didn't work on putting myself in bad positions
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.440]   when you get better and you regret it.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.760]   'Cause the big negative thing it has,
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.260]   consequence it has on competition
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.840]   is you don't take as many risks
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.360]   'cause you're kind of afraid for your back
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.240]   to get taken, all that kind of stuff.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.800]   - That was me before I went to DDS.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.240]   I remember I showed up there in that old position.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.960]   I was like, fuck this.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.240]   You better earn this position.
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.880]   - I didn't really have escapes.
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:47.000]   That was a learning curve for me, for sure.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.880]   - Do you see the value in positional training
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.400]   or is it just the source of tremendous frustration?
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.100]   - Yeah, I definitely think it plays a big part
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:56.680]   in your confidence when you step out
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.960]   onto the competition mats,
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.740]   being confident that even if you get put
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:02.920]   in the worst possible situations,
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.120]   you know what to do and know how to work out of them.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.960]   - So I had a long argument with Hydra Gracie
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:10.620]   when he visited and he thinks mount
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:15.620]   is the most dominant position, even Nogi versus Beck.
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:18.880]   Is there a case to be made for that or no?
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.920]   - I think all of your opponent's utensils,
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.840]   their tools are in front of them.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:26.020]   So if you're on mount, there's a few ways
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:26.860]   to get out of mount.
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:28.260]   I think if you're on somebody's back,
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.740]   I'd personally much rather be on somebody's back than--
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:31.780]   - Flattened out.
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:34.540]   I'd rather have someone's back and then flattened out.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.540]   - Boots in, flattened out, yeah.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:37.380]   - Boots in, flattened out.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:40.340]   So not even body triangle, but just flattened.
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.620]   - Just completely flat, almost like the position in MMA
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.700]   where you see guys get finished 'cause they can't get out.
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.380]   I think that position is probably
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.580]   the hardest position to escape.
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.380]   - Can you see what Hydra's talking about with mount
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.060]   or is he just that good at mount, like he says that?
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:55.340]   - Might mean the gi, cross collar, I don't know.
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:56.180]   Or did he mean--
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:58.320]   - He says controlling wise, he just believes
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:01.520]   that you can complete, that there's,
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:03.960]   he actually thinks there's more ways to get out
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:05.920]   from the back than there is from the mount.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:06.920]   - Prior to--
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.120]   - Getting up, including physically.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.760]   - Prior to the kipping escape, I would probably agree
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:15.040]   with him, but that kipping escape's so difficult to manage.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:18.520]   It's the funny looking escape where your legs are wiggling.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.020]   People have a lot of trouble.
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:21.840]   It's super hard to learn how to do,
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.040]   but then once you learn how to do it,
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.600]   the effectiveness is just huge.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:26.520]   - Yeah, it's a weird one.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.360]   When did that come to be a thing?
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:30.480]   Is that pretty recent?
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:33.520]   - I mean, I saw DDS guys using it first, I think.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:36.800]   - Who's the first guy to discover something like that?
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:39.680]   This seems like a ridiculous thing to discover.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:41.240]   - Yeah, like what if I just wiggle?
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.960]   (all laughing)
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.800]   - I thought it was a joke at first.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.320]   I was like, "You guys really doing this?"
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:46.720]   Yeah, all right.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.440]   (all laughing)
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:50.520]   - I remember somebody showing me a technique
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:54.600]   where if you just walk your hand on a mat
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.800]   or something like that.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.840]   - Like an arm triangle or something?
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:57.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:58.500]   - You're trying to walk the arm.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:05:59.340]   - On the arm high?
[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.600]   - And it's just a funny discovery
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:04.320]   as opposed to trying to shove it in, just walk it.
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.280]   - I like doing that to people,
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.840]   but with things that aren't true.
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:07.680]   (Jay laughs)
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.500]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:09.560]   I'll just tell them this is a technique
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:13.240]   and watch them try to work out if I'm being serious or not.
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:15.600]   - Yeah, that's what you do when you achieve guru status.
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   They'll just listen to you like you're Steven Seagal.
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:19.040]   - See what they'll believe.
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:20.840]   (Jay laughs)
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.480]   - Speaking of which, how do you balance,
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:24.000]   you have to travel all across the world,
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.240]   how do you balance that with running a school
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.280]   or being a world-class Jiu-Jitsu athlete?
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:32.120]   - I mean, the secrets of travel for me are two drugs,
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.560]   Xanax and modafinil.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:37.800]   That's how we time adjust and we hit the ground running.
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.520]   - What does modafinil do?
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:40.960]   Xanax puts you to sleep.
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I have narcolepsy,
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:43.800]   so it's a narcolepsy medication.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:46.380]   (all laughing)
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.880]   - How does that work with the steroids?
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.600]   - I mean, they work well together, you know?
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:53.600]   - Yeah, nice.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.960]   - Focus and physical recovery.
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:57.840]   But in terms of traveling and training stuff,
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.040]   I mean, we're lucky 'cause we got so many high-level guys,
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:03.680]   so we can travel and they're still in good hands.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:05.120]   I mean, it would be a problem if me,
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.240]   Nicky Rod and Nicky Ryan left and the gym had Ethan,
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.520]   that would be a problem.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:11.040]   But we gotta make sure it's not just him there.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:14.720]   - Although everyone says they're happy when you're gone,
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:16.120]   so that's the moment I heard.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:18.160]   - Happy when I'm gone, but they do miss me.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:19.000]   - Yeah.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.040]   - For sure, until I get back.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.320]   (all laughing)
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.240]   - All right, what about you?
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.280]   Just like balancing it,
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:26.520]   do you try to stay completely focused on competing?
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.440]   Like for some of the big matches you have coming up,
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.200]   are you able to kind of diversify?
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:33.120]   - Well, I like to, yeah, diversify my training
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.440]   to where if I don't have a competition scheduled,
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:39.760]   I'm more focused on skill development and getting better
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:41.960]   and broadening my tool shed.
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:45.680]   But if I'm like six weeks before comp,
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:48.400]   I really start amping up the intensity
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.760]   that I bring into the mats against bringing some
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:53.800]   of that visualization towards practice.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.160]   And maybe I train less volume pre-competition,
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.760]   but higher output per session.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.680]   - Yeah, what's a perfect week of training look like?
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:05.040]   - If I'm not in competition mode,
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.280]   I would say Monday, Wednesday, Friday twice,
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.360]   every other day just once.
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:14.200]   If I'm pre-comp, just Monday to Sunday once a day.
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:16.840]   - So that's on the mat, you're doing the full
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.960]   like positional training, live training.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.320]   - Bicep curls.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.040]   - Oh yeah, I do a lot of bicep curls.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:23.880]   Yeah, I lift a few times a week now.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:25.560]   - Yeah, cardio or no?
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.840]   Cardio is all mat stuff.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:27.840]   - Cardio is all mat stuff.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:31.200]   I do do some CrossFit workouts, like CrossFit's,
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.400]   I'll do like some EMOMs or some AMRAPs,
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:35.240]   or CrossFit terms.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.200]   - That's for Instagram?
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.040]   - Yeah.
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:43.520]   But yeah, CrossFit is a good way to kind of like push
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:45.840]   that threshold sometimes on the mat,
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.760]   'cause I'm so good, I can't always get that full red line.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.760]   So I'll hop in across the gym and I'll do some workouts
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.000]   that bring me closer to death.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.600]   - What about you, Craig?
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:01.920]   What is a perfect week in training look like?
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:03.480]   Like when you're back home training?
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.120]   - I try to be in the gym twice a day, every day,
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.320]   when I'm back, just 'cause I travel a bit more
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.240]   than these guys.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:11.160]   So I try to be there eight and 12 every day,
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:12.920]   hang out in between.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.320]   I usually train both of those sessions,
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.560]   depending on how my body feels.
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.920]   - So doing positional, doing every technique,
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.440]   positional, live?
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.800]   - I should probably do more positional,
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:24.680]   but 'cause I'm just trying to work on wrestling and stuff,
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.480]   and especially leading up to the Volkanovskis last fall,
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.840]   I was trying to wrestle more and focus on those areas,
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:31.640]   even before I traveled over there,
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:33.920]   just some experimentation with some stuff.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.160]   But yeah.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.160]   - How do you experiment with stuff?
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.520]   So there's like regular positional stuff,
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:39.880]   but when you have ideas,
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:44.480]   like where do you do it in during the training sessions,
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:45.920]   or do you do it outside of that?
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:48.000]   Do you get together with somebody?
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.840]   - Usually every session I show up
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.520]   with something I'm thinking of.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.520]   Usually something from top, maybe something from bottom,
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.680]   but, and then I just try to maybe pick the right people.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:00.640]   Some people, obviously, I'm just fighting to the death with,
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:02.560]   it's not a good time to experiment.
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.680]   And then others, obviously you can play around
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:05.560]   with ideas on.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:08.760]   - Okay, what about you?
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.720]   What's a perfect week look like?
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.600]   Maybe, well, you said you're 100% now.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.840]   - Yeah.
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.680]   So yeah, honestly,
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.440]   I have pretty much the same schedule as Nicky Rod.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.760]   So Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do twice a day,
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:21.360]   every other day, once a day.
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:24.680]   And then normally noon practice is like our biggest class.
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.600]   That's where all the pros go in.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:28.880]   So I tend to do more open rounds there.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.800]   And then we have a 7 p.m. class as well,
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:32.280]   which is more hobbyist.
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.360]   And that's where I'll do my positional rounds
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.320]   and force myself to be put in bad positions.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.480]   - So you have, what, you do 8 a.m., 12,
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.720]   like in terms of what B team has,
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:46.120]   8 a.m., 12, and 7 p.m.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:47.760]   And the hobbyists are more 7 p.m.
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.800]   - Yes.
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:49.960]   - Okay.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.520]   Do you believe in overtraining?
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.800]   Do you think you can overtrain?
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.480]   - I used to not believe in it.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:56.360]   (all laughing)
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:57.520]   But then I got hurt.
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.280]   - Oh, you attribute that to overtraining?
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:02.120]   The bicep?
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.480]   - I think, dude, I'm telling you,
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:06.800]   I trained, I lifted like a bodybuilder for like seven years.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:10.040]   And by lifting, I mean, I was lifting seven days a week.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.960]   And I trained arms most days.
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.680]   Like almost every day I would do like four or five sets
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:21.000]   and get a pretty good bicep pump in addition to my lift.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.200]   I think that had to contribute somewhat towards my--
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:26.640]   - What about, okay, yeah, fair enough.
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:28.920]   Well, what about on the actual mat overtraining,
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:30.440]   like spending too much time on the mat?
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:31.280]   - Well--
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.840]   - Psychological, physical overtraining?
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.240]   - I think you can definitely overtrain,
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.200]   but it's more of a, like, as your body's healthy,
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.040]   you have to make sure your mind is sharp.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.360]   Like sometimes maybe taking a day away
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:44.560]   or even diverting your attention
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.400]   in a different aspect of training
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.800]   can help you be a little bit sharper overall.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.120]   Sometimes it can be like,
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.440]   it can get a little like stagnant
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.280]   'cause you're doing the same stuff over and over.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.040]   But I think if you just keep like overtraining,
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:00.040]   then your overall baseline just gets higher
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:03.000]   and you become accustomed to that.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.600]   - What about you?
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:08.040]   You don't seem like a guy that over, okay.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:08.880]   - I've heard of it.
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.480]   I've never been close to it.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.560]   No, I think controlling how hard you train
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.320]   is definitely, it protects you from injury.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.160]   You know what I mean?
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.240]   Like if you're redlining yourself
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.680]   and then you're fighting to the death in the gym,
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.040]   that's 100% when you're gonna get injured, gonna get sick.
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.160]   So I try to make sure I've had enough sleep,
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.200]   I've had obviously enough food post-training,
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:34.400]   and that sort of helps me to train a bit harder, but.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.520]   Still try to avoid redlining myself too much.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.520]   - I think established also like what days
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.800]   are gonna be your peak days?
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:41.960]   'Cause you're, throughout the week,
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.040]   if you're training seven days a week,
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.440]   you're gonna have ups and downs.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:47.400]   Like for me personally, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.120]   usually my best days.
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:51.600]   And besides that, I also have other great days.
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.480]   - All my days are great.
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:58.480]   But Monday, Wednesday, Friday are also great.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.000]   You're like unable to admit
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.880]   that some days are rougher than others.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:04.720]   - I love that.
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:07.200]   I'm always on, bro.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:08.840]   Okay.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.400]   What advice would you give to people
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:12.720]   who are not always on, hobbyists?
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.800]   How to get better?
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:16.200]   Like people that are already there, I don't know,
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.040]   Purple Bells, Brown Bells, Black Bells,
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.560]   they're just like doing like a couple of times a week
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:21.400]   or something like that.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:22.480]   Like how to get better?
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:25.320]   - I think being consistent,
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:27.680]   like find a schedule that you can consistently train.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.760]   Maybe it's like three, four times a week
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.400]   or even a little bit less.
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:33.640]   Just be consistent over the years.
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.160]   I think too often people are like,
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.680]   "Oh, I wanna get really good really fast."
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:38.520]   And it's like, definitely takes a long time
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.600]   to get to where you wanna be.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.640]   - What about what you're doing during like,
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:43.680]   while being consistent,
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.840]   what kind of stuff you're working on?
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.440]   - So honestly, I think one big thing for me,
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.160]   which is something I actually started doing
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.800]   once B-Team was formed, was filming all of your rounds
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:57.040]   and then watching it every day.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.560]   'Cause then you can see what specific problems you're having
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.360]   and then you can base your positional rounds
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.680]   around those problems.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.640]   - That's really interesting.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:06.240]   It's kind of depressing though.
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:07.600]   - Yeah.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.400]   - Like sometimes I have to,
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.680]   I edited this podcast for a long time.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:14.400]   I still do in part and I hate the sound of my voice
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:16.360]   and like what I look like and stuff.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:18.040]   But it does make you better.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:18.880]   - Yeah.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.800]   - And I also hate the sound of Craig's voice.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:21.640]   (laughing)
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:24.960]   So editing this podcast will be especially difficult.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:27.280]   This will be doubly difficult.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.000]   But I'm glad the rest of you are here.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:29.840]   I don't know.
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:30.680]   That's a really...
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:32.600]   (laughing)
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:34.960]   - Do you watch competition footage of yourself?
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:37.440]   Like to analyze?
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:39.280]   - Oh, it boosts my confidence.
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:40.120]   (laughing)
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.440]   That's fucking good.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.520]   - While you're doing curls?
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.360]   - Yeah.
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:44.960]   - I try not to watch it to boost my confidence.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:46.080]   (laughing)
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.160]   - Is there advice you, Craig,
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:49.640]   you would give for hobbyists to get better?
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:52.520]   - I mean, just not every round
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.520]   has to be a fight to the death, you know?
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:56.120]   I feel like you're gonna get injured,
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.520]   burn the tail that way.
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:59.040]   You're not gonna learn as much.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:14:59.880]   - It's tough.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:01.960]   I would say just as a black belt
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.120]   who took Jiu-Jitsu very seriously for a very long time,
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.560]   basically when you become a hobbyist,
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:10.920]   your skill is basically slipping,
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.240]   your age and your skill.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.280]   And so not taking stuff seriously
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.800]   is actually its own psychological skill of like...
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:21.240]   (laughing)
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.120]   That it's tough.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:23.960]   It's tough.
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.280]   Like it's tough in a way that is different
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:29.280]   when you're like a blue belt or something
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:33.000]   that if you work hard and you train correctly,
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.800]   you're gonna get much better.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.040]   Here, you're kinda...
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:36.960]   - You're looking downhill.
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:38.400]   - You're looking downhill.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.600]   You're like, "Yeah, I guess I'm gonna enjoy the art of it."
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:43.640]   - Reframe the victory.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:45.320]   You know, like if it's a young upcoming guy
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.240]   and he comes to me, you're like,
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:48.880]   "Well, that's a moral victory," you know?
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.640]   - Yeah, but then that has to happen.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.200]   You have to be able to not do that
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:55.000]   to avoid the injury sometimes, like if you want.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.560]   So yeah, it's a different thing.
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:01.480]   Plus with me, just because some people recognize me,
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:02.320]   they...
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.520]   - They're coming.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.080]   - You have that probably.
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:06.880]   You guys definitely obviously have that.
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.920]   - I've solved that problem.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.080]   - How did you solve that problem?
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:13.000]   - Travel around, you do a seminar, anything like that.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.400]   It's believable that you could get submitted once.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:19.080]   But if they catch you, give them a few.
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:19.920]   If people tell their friends
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:23.120]   they submitted me to a seminar one time, believable.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.920]   They got me four or five times.
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.200]   You've robbed them of that.
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:27.640]   - Okay, that's pretty funny.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:30.920]   But it's also, they have this energy,
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:34.120]   like they think, they're coming in hot.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:37.320]   And I usually like to just basically
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.280]   get submitted quickly twice.
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:42.240]   And just, it changes everything.
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.280]   It makes it more fun.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:45.280]   I've noticed it.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.120]   - Let them submit you twice?
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:47.560]   - Yeah, just like very quickly.
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.840]   What are the options?
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:50.680]   (laughing)
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:52.360]   - We're not saying you're not.
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.840]   - Make it last longer.
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:54.680]   Hold off.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.800]   (laughing)
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.000]   - But then it's like, it's very hard to,
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.680]   yeah, if you're a very serious competitor
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:01.880]   and so on, you take it seriously, then yes.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:05.600]   - Then people go, people, what they try to do,
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.000]   this probably is what happens to you guys,
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.040]   they try to impress you by going super hard.
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.840]   - I have people every day come to my gym
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.440]   try to take me out.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.680]   I just say, "Sharp, come to practice, let's get it on."
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:21.840]   - Do you feel that energy?
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:23.880]   I feel like I need to talk to Craig here first.
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:25.520]   (laughing)
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:28.400]   - Like at a seminar, somebody is coming in really hard,
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:29.960]   like a brown belt will come in
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.120]   and they really wanna impress you
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.440]   with their technical side, they're a big fan,
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:35.200]   they've been watching your DVDs,
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:36.040]   what do you do with a guy like that?
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.440]   - I make a complete joke out of the role.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.680]   Give them the pass, mess with them, do stupid shit.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.000]   Rub them of the realness of it.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.360]   'Cause it's stupid, I'm not gonna roll hard with strangers.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:49.680]   I feel like you should roll with a circle of people
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:51.120]   you trust.
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:53.920]   Injuries happen rolling hard with strangers
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.680]   'cause that's the same way you get injured in competition
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:58.720]   'cause you don't have that relationship with them.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.040]   - And I should also mention,
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.760]   that's probably not a good way to impress somebody
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:05.160]   is by just going ape shit, going 100%.
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:06.880]   - Oh yeah, not at all.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.200]   - I think the beauty of Jiu-Jitsu
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.400]   is the camaraderie of it.
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:11.400]   As you get to know each other,
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:14.320]   it's technical, different ideas you have and all that.
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.160]   Yeah, okay.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.400]   Do you think Gi Jiu-Jitsu is dying in popularity, Craig?
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:23.160]   - Yeah, it's long dead.
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.920]   I think it's just shows like,
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:29.680]   I have heard some numbers on the viewership
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:31.200]   for the Gi Worlds finals
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.680]   and they don't even compare to the undercard
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:34.040]   of like who's number one events.
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:35.760]   So I think like when I was coming up
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:37.320]   and competing in the Gi all the time,
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:38.160]   you looked at those guys
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.480]   that won black belt with championships
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:40.800]   and you were like in awe of them.
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:43.200]   It almost had that ADCC champion feel.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.320]   But now that's not the case.
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:47.240]   You know, I just feel like that,
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:48.600]   the younger generation aren't looking at
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:50.080]   who's winning black belt, Gi Worlds.
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:51.600]   I personally don't think,
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:53.040]   and I don't think they're like,
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.600]   they wanna be that guy.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:56.960]   They wanna be like a Rotolo, Gordon,
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:59.800]   you know, those are the people they wanna emulate.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:01.080]   - So you think like the Gi,
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:03.320]   like AbiyJJF Gi tournaments
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:06.440]   will just keep declining popularity?
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:07.760]   - I think people will still do it.
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:10.080]   I mean, it's easier I think as you're over 30
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.680]   'cause the Gi is a bit of a slower thing
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.320]   and the masters participation is bigger in the Gi
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:16.560]   'cause obviously in No Gi
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:18.400]   is now heading in a wrestling direction.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.240]   Wrestling and heel hooks, you're over 30,
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.480]   that's a terrifying prospect.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:24.240]   So you know, what's terrifying about the Gi?
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.080]   Less.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:25.960]   So I think in a participation rate,
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.840]   the AbiyJJF will still be good,
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:30.400]   but I just don't think people are as interested
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:31.320]   as they used to be.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.760]   - Well, why is wrestling and heel hooks terrifying?
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:35.400]   Like heel hooks I can vaguely understand
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:36.760]   if you don't understand heel hooks.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.400]   - You work a desk job and you've never wrestled
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.240]   and a guy double legs you,
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.160]   that's gonna probably break your back.
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:44.400]   You know, I think the older guys are scared of wrestling.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:46.360]   It's hard to wrestle at 40.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.520]   - To learn wrestling at 40.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:48.360]   - Is it?
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:50.040]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's even just hard in general
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:51.480]   to do wrestling at 40,
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:54.480]   but it's easy to pull half guard in the Gi at 40.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.240]   - I think it's hard to do judo at 40
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.040]   and people still do it at 40.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:19:59.200]   Judo hurts more.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.240]   - Judo's scarier than all of them.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:02.080]   - Yeah.
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:04.240]   I think, does wrestling really hurt at 40?
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.280]   - I don't know.
[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:07.120]   - I don't know, I'm looking at you.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:08.120]   - Yeah.
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.600]   - It does, interesting.
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:10.880]   - I feel, I agree with you saying
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:13.360]   that judo looks like the most dangerous.
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:15.160]   Like even their practice partners,
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.280]   they're just getting slammed flat.
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:18.640]   They're bueno.
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.920]   - Yeah, I did judo for a really long time.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.920]   There's a lot of people that are 40, 50, 60 do judo.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:24.760]   And they get-
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.520]   - They're the ones that are still alive though.
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.240]   (laughing)
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:29.720]   - It's true.
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:30.600]   Survivor bias.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:33.560]   You do a little bit of judo, right?
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:34.880]   - Yeah, I'm a yellow belt.
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.720]   - You're a yellow belt in judo?
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.120]   I should be your instructor.
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.600]   (laughing)
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:40.560]   Promote you to orange.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.280]   - I got a yellow belt in the sixth grade.
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:43.520]   I believe it was the sixth grade.
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:46.080]   I did it for about, I don't know, six months.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:51.080]   - But you're also using judo in competition, basically.
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:52.760]   Aren't you doing like harai type throw,
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:54.080]   like you're doing-
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.200]   - Yeah, I don't know where I learned that.
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:56.040]   I just started doing it.
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:57.320]   - You just started lifting your leg
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:58.600]   in various ways until it worked?
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:00.080]   - Just figuring it out, yeah.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:01.320]   - Doing different kinds of trips?
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:02.160]   - I looked at the sandboat guys doing it.
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:03.960]   I was like, "Can't be that hard."
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:04.800]   - Yeah.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:05.760]   - Gave it a crack.
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.360]   - Well, they looked at your foot locks
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:09.520]   and they said, "That can't be that hard."
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:10.480]   - They said, "Can't be that hard.
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:11.800]   "Ban it from the tournaments."
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:14.040]   (laughing)
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:15.840]   - All right.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:18.520]   (laughing)
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:23.520]   What do you think is the best takedown in nogi, jujitsu?
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:27.760]   Like what, like if people were trying to train
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:28.880]   for a competition, so on,
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:31.520]   like where you see the trends heading?
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.520]   - I think the foot sweep is like catching fire nowadays.
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:37.080]   See a lot of foot sweeps.
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:38.120]   Foot sweeps and arm drags,
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:40.600]   I would say pretty popular in our sport.
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:41.440]   - Arm drag.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:43.040]   So you just got arm drag to, okay.
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:46.760]   Arm drag either to get them, like get to behind them
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.360]   or even just to cause reactions, make them pull away
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:50.800]   and we can start reattacking.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.720]   - Are you talking about it in a context
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.080]   of what's the best takedown to score?
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:58.280]   What's the safest takedown to mitigate the risk
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.480]   of guillotine submission or most effective in general?
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.520]   - Yeah, most effective combined.
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:06.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:08.600]   I mean, ultimately it's about scoring.
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:11.760]   - I think any sort of body lock, you know what I mean?
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.680]   Locking your hands around the body,
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:14.160]   being able to put them to the floor that way.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:15.920]   I feel like that's most effective, safest.
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:18.360]   Might even have arisen out of a leg attack,
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:20.600]   a leg entry, upgrade to the body.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:23.680]   - What about like foot sweeps, like outside foot sweeps?
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.720]   What do we?
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:25.880]   - I would say, yeah, you know,
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.560]   foot sweeps from outside foot sweeps
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:30.160]   or even like something like you're tossed on a poor body
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:31.640]   and you're sweeping the foot.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:32.840]   - Yeah, those are all pretty safe.
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:33.920]   See, why is that scary?
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:35.120]   I don't understand.
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:36.240]   It's not scary at all.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:37.800]   - I think it's the lifts that are scary.
[02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:38.640]   - The lifts, yeah.
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:40.160]   - Who's lifting people?
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:41.320]   - I'm like, you're like a good lifter.
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.160]   - Return?
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:43.520]   - I'm not, I mean, in master,
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.600]   like we're talking about older guys doing no gi.
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.640]   - Some of those old bosses take it very serious.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.480]   - They just start lifting.
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:49.600]   - TRT worlds.
[02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:50.440]   - TRT world.
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:51.480]   - They're coming.
[02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:52.320]   They're coming to impress.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.840]   - Grab a lift, all right.
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:55.280]   Just for the gram.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:57.280]   Okay, what about submission?
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:58.720]   What's your favorite submission?
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:01.680]   And what do you think is the most effective submission?
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:02.920]   Except the buggy choke.
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.640]   - I would have to say the rear naked.
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:07.280]   It's definitely the one that's hit the most
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.240]   and the highest level of competition.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:11.680]   - Was that, that was pretty interesting
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:14.360]   to see you escape all that and to put it on.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:15.600]   That's the cool thing about EBI,
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:18.120]   to see like the world-class athletes.
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:20.440]   I was surprised that it's possible to escape
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.640]   with you on his back.
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:22.920]   - Gotta try some B cream.
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.760]   - Oh yeah.
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:24.980]   - B cream, as it helps?
[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:29.280]   What's in the, what's the formula or is that a secret?
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:31.520]   - That is a proprietary blend for sure.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.560]   - Okay, but that's what you use for greasing.
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.400]   That's what you greased before.
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:36.240]   - Allegedly.
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.080]   - Allegedly.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.680]   Is there other application outside of grappling?
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:41.520]   Or?
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:42.360]   - I'm sure you can get creative.
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:43.400]   - All right.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.600]   Thanks.
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:46.160]   Asking for a friend.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:47.800]   Is that RNC for you as well?
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:48.880]   Rear naked?
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:51.000]   - Rear naked choke, I mean, overall favorite
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.080]   for like solidifying a finish.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:55.480]   'Cause like you can push, you can put somebody to sleep.
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:56.320]   Right?
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.420]   Even if they don't want to tag, put them to sleep.
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:00.760]   But as far as like something I've been working on now
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:03.120]   that I'm now starting to implement in competition,
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:06.600]   Yoko Senkaku side triangle is like, it's a beautiful thing.
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:07.920]   You have multiple options.
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.040]   You have the triangle to finish.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.840]   If that fails, you have the Kimura.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.800]   You could break the arm.
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:13.840]   You could also just transfer and take the back.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:16.000]   So Yoko Senkaku, I'm a big fan of,
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.160]   and I continue to progress and get better at it.
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.760]   - Have you ever broken anyone's arm?
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:21.580]   - Oh yeah.
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:23.200]   I mean, the first few competitions,
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:25.440]   'cause I was like, you know, pretty athletic grappler,
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:28.480]   or athletic wrestler going against like local black belts
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:29.320]   and brown belts.
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.200]   Like one of my first matches, I broke somebody at Kimura.
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:35.240]   Pretty much every time I've got a heel hook,
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:37.540]   which is only twice I've broken an opponent.
[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:40.840]   If I have a joint lock, it's probably going to break.
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.360]   Like a lot of times it breaks before they tap.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.200]   Yeah.
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:45.480]   - You seem like a really friendly fella.
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:49.600]   How hard is it to break an arm or break a joint?
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:52.000]   - Well, I don't think it's that hard.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.240]   I think like if you're talking like about an arm bar,
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.240]   we have this position to where like people are kind of
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:59.680]   holding on, holding on, and then it slips
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.960]   and their arm starts going.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:03.520]   And then it just breaks before they even, you know,
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:04.560]   get a chance to tap.
[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:07.160]   - I love this point.
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:09.080]   - I knee barred a guy and he didn't tap one time.
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:12.120]   And it was actually, it was surprising.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.200]   I had to put a lot of force into that.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:17.600]   As opposed to arms, shoulders, and the ligaments in the knees
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.180]   and ankles, but to fully, this kid, Sambo kid,
[02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:23.840]   fully let it go.
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:24.680]   And he tapped it out.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:26.040]   I think the angle is like up here.
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.340]   - They're built different.
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:31.920]   - Hopefully he can be reconstructed different.
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:32.760]   - He's rebuilt different.
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.600]   (laughing)
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:36.440]   - All right.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:39.640]   What about a straight foot lock?
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:42.600]   You've ever, do you guys do straight foot locks at all?
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:43.900]   Or no?
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:45.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm learning them now.
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.360]   We had some kid come in the practice one day
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:50.120]   and like, fucking full on, all of us do.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:50.960]   - With a straight foot lock.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.360]   - Straight foot lock, just this little like Polish kid.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.080]   - Not only did he foot lock everyone,
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.600]   but he told the entire world.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.800]   (laughing)
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:59.640]   He sent out fucking emails,
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.840]   called his friends and family.
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.040]   We practically put a hit out on him in practice
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:05.440]   and he just sent everybody.
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:06.480]   (laughing)
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:08.880]   - Yeah, it's always interesting when you get like,
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:10.840]   yeah, people that specialize can surprise you
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.680]   that this could be effective stuff.
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:13.840]   Do you think there's other stuff
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.420]   that could be still discovered in Jiu Jitsu?
[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:20.640]   Like what areas do you think are ripe
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:22.660]   with techniques to discover?
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:25.200]   Like wrestling is really interesting now.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.160]   There's a lot of innovation happening in wrestling.
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.520]   - I think there'll be more innovation
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.880]   when we get people that are more adamant
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.960]   about standing up from bottom position.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.680]   I think if we get more of the community,
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:37.440]   they're like, all right, I wanna get off the bottom.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.080]   - DDD, just stand up.
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:39.920]   - Just stand up.
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:42.040]   - How Jiu Jitsu doesn't work.
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:43.240]   - We actually changed the name.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:45.160]   How Sambo doesn't work if you just stand up.
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.000]   - Did you really?
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:46.840]   - Yeah.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.660]   - All right.
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:50.280]   I'll change it to Jiu Jitsu when I pirate it
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:53.540]   and send it for free to the entirety of the Soviet block.
[02:26:53.540 --> 02:26:55.320]   (laughing)
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:57.760]   And Nikki Rod, do you think ego is useful for martial arts
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:26:59.260]   or does it get in the way?
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:02.540]   - Okay, I think you need to use it in both ways.
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:04.840]   For sure, have an ego,
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:07.420]   like if you're training competition mode,
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.560]   but also it can prevent you from learning
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.600]   and progressing if your ego is too high.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:14.640]   Like you really have to shut the ego down
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.960]   when you're in the mode of learning
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.920]   and trying to develop skills
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.680]   'cause you're gonna put yourself in these bad positions.
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:22.480]   You're gonna have issues with training partners
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.660]   that aren't necessarily up to your skill level,
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:27.200]   but because you're in these bad positions,
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.240]   you have to make these certain sacrifices.
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:31.360]   And for sure, ego can be a good or bad thing,
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:34.140]   but if you're able to shut the ego off and learn,
[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:35.380]   then that'll have huge progression
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:38.160]   when it's time to put the ego into use during competition.
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:41.120]   - When's the last time you shut the ego off?
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:42.160]   - It's been a long time.
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:44.420]   (laughing)
[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:47.400]   - What about you, Craig?
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:50.680]   I mean, you seem to be super easygoing.
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:53.560]   Is the ego just not part of it?
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:54.400]   - Oh, for sure.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.560]   I just don't want anyone to know they've damaged my ego.
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.920]   You have to suppress it deep down.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.040]   - There's a child underneath all of it crying always.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:03.880]   - For sure.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:05.680]   I think ego is good for a bit of perseverance.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:07.320]   Like it'll help you stick it out
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.400]   against a tough battle with a training partner, for sure.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:11.760]   A bit of ego's on the line.
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:13.280]   Plus the bands are back and forth.
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.440]   We're trying to stir each other up a bit.
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:16.280]   - Talk this shit, yeah.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:18.700]   - I think that helps hone, sharpen the ego a bit.
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:21.000]   - Oh, what about you?
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.040]   Do you seem like a super humble guy?
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.480]   Is there a monster underneath?
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:25.800]   - It's a total act.
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.800]   - Yeah, I definitely think ego's a big motivator.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.720]   I think it's very good to have in the aspect
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.360]   that it'll drive you to want to be one of the best
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.180]   in the world.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:41.240]   But like Nicky Rod said,
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:43.200]   you need to be able to turn it off in the training room
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:45.180]   and force yourself into bad positions
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:46.640]   where you may not be winning.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.760]   - Are there, like, Donna has mentioned Boris.
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.320]   Are there grapplers like Boris?
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:57.480]   This is a question from Reddit, actually.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.880]   Boris-like characters, anybody you've trained with
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:01.440]   in the past who doesn't compete
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:04.240]   but is just an absolute beast in training?
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:05.960]   Like people you've met that are just like--
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:08.080]   - Well, somebody that I think has probably
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:11.480]   the best submission grappling in MMA,
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:14.000]   I think like Gilbert Burns is,
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.080]   his submission grappling is very, very good.
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:18.400]   I trained with him early on in my grappling career
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:21.340]   and I was really impressed by his ability to move,
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:23.560]   hold down opponents that are trying to stand up.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:27.340]   And as a whole, he can get submissions and put people away.
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:29.680]   - Have you, when's the last time,
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:31.320]   have you trained with him recently or no?
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:33.120]   - No, it's been a few years.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:36.960]   - Which is an impressive ability to submit, you're saying?
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.840]   - Yeah, like, I mean, you would see,
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.080]   I'd see Gilbert go against a few
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:43.760]   pretty decent black belts in the room and fare well.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.040]   And maybe he gets to their back, puts a choke in,
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:48.840]   and it's like Gilbert's super high-level grappling
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:50.280]   or submission grappling.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:53.280]   - Yeah, but he's pretty widely recognized as a monster.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.080]   So I don't know, you didn't really answer the question.
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:56.920]   It's like you're not even listening anymore.
[02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:58.440]   - I don't remember what was the question.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:01.020]   (all laughing)
[02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:05.680]   - All right, well, what, is there people,
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:06.840]   like you've done all these seminars,
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.480]   are there just, especially in the Eastern Bloc,
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:13.240]   the, you've seen, like you went to Kazakhstan,
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:14.760]   is there killers out there that--
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.160]   - Oh yeah, there's tough guys out there.
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:17.680]   Obviously I don't remember their names
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:19.040]   nor could I pronounce it if I did,
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:20.960]   but definitely some tough guys out there,
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:24.040]   obviously carrying skill sets over from wrestling for sure,
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:25.680]   not Sambo, but wrestling.
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.680]   - Wrestling, but yeah, are there just people
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:29.240]   that surprise you that just don't compete,
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.080]   that are really good?
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:31.600]   Are there, have you met those?
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:33.960]   - I feel like it's less so today
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:37.120]   'cause there's so many more athletes in the sport,
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.160]   but definitely when I was coming up
[02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:40.700]   back like in Australia and stuff,
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:42.360]   there were guys I'd train with that wouldn't compete
[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:44.760]   and that would be like super tough rounds for me.
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:46.600]   - Yeah, and there's so many more avenues
[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:48.960]   for competing in general, so yeah.
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.600]   - What about you, have you met some monsters?
[02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:54.880]   - Yeah, one guy I could think of in particular
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:59.880]   is Jason Rau, he trains up in Long Island I think, right?
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:02.480]   Opened up his own gym out there.
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:03.320]   - Vanguard.
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.440]   - Yeah, Vanguard, he used to compete,
[02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:07.120]   but he would never be able to compete
[02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:08.800]   at the same level he would train at,
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:10.800]   so now he's just focused on mainly,
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:14.320]   opening up a gym and teaching his students,
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:16.840]   but he was a guy that was extremely good
[02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:18.680]   in the training room, world-class.
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:21.120]   I still think to this day he's legitimately
[02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:22.880]   one of the best in the world,
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:25.200]   but just doesn't compete anymore.
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:28.200]   - Who wins in a fight, a lion or a bear?
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.960]   - Polo bear?
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:31.800]   - This is for you, Reddit.
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:33.240]   No, not a polo, well yes, it's a good question.
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:35.480]   See, your polo bear is pretty impressive.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:36.560]   No, grizzly bear.
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:37.400]   - Grizzly bear.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:41.480]   I think a grizzly bear wins.
[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:44.320]   - Well, who is the most threatening predator in Australia?
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.440]   Kangaroo?
[02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:47.560]   - Well, I mean, it's a tricky question here
[02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:51.000]   'cause everyone's scared of the animals in Australia,
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.000]   but I mean, you get bitten by a snake,
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.920]   you get bitten by a spider, that's not that bad.
[02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:59.360]   Bear, America, a bear will just hold you down and eat you.
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.480]   That's a much more terrifying prospect for me.
[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:03.880]   Even sharks, sharks are gonna be quick.
[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:04.920]   No one sees the shark coming,
[02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:05.760]   the shark's just gonna bite you in half.
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:07.480]   - A bear will take a bite and chew.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:09.200]   - A bear just holds you down and eats you,
[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.760]   so that's frightening for me.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:13.360]   Australia's a bunch of just weird shit that can kill you.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.920]   - Did you see "Cocaine Bear," the movie that's coming out?
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:17.160]   - I saw the trailer, it looks good.
[02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:19.640]   - Yeah, yeah, so there's not every bear,
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:21.120]   there's like black belts and there's black belts,
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:22.800]   there's bears and there's bears.
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.000]   So I think that's what they often don't talk about.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.720]   Everybody puts lions and bears in the same category.
[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.280]   I think there's just some weak bears.
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.560]   - A lion would kill a black bear, I think.
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.560]   - Not every black, again, I'm trying to tell you,
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:36.440]   there's difference.
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:39.280]   - But grizzly and polar bear, I'm betting on those.
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.360]   - Yeah, no, I think grizzlies have the size,
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.240]   but actually every video I've seen of grizzlies,
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:46.440]   they tie out within like 20 seconds.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:47.600]   They get bored.
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:48.680]   - That's the gas tank?
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:49.520]   - Yeah, the gas tank.
[02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:50.360]   - That's a Nicky Ryan gas tank, right?
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.400]   - Yeah, that's all they got.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:53.240]   - Dream old.
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:54.120]   (laughing)
[02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:57.480]   - And they try to just take a breather.
[02:32:57.480 --> 02:32:59.360]   Like there's these crazy fights between bears
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:01.040]   and they last like 20 seconds.
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:03.880]   - I heard this story about a Russian family
[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:07.680]   that was attacked by a bear in Russia and killed the dad.
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.560]   And it took so long to eat the daughter,
[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:11.960]   she made three phone calls to her mom while I was eating her.
[02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:14.720]   And the first call, the mom thought she was pranking her.
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:15.560]   - That's crazy.
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:17.920]   - That's way scarier than what we go through now.
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:20.120]   Give me a snake bite any day.
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:22.600]   - Yeah, you know what, let me change the question.
[02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:29.000]   If you had to fight a bear or a lion,
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.560]   how would you try to defeat it?
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:32.040]   Do you think you have a chance at all?
[02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:35.600]   - Well, I think I'd attack a lion a little bit differently
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.080]   than I'd attack a bear.
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.800]   - What would be the difference?
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:43.800]   - Okay, well, I've seen this video where a lion's are eating
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:47.800]   and you have three like screeny guys walk up behind them
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:50.880]   and kind of scare the cat off of their food.
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:55.400]   I think maybe I produce some props, scare the lion away.
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:59.640]   But if I have to fight it straight on,
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:02.260]   I mean, the thing is that even if you take the back,
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:03.720]   like you can't like bite it or choke it,
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:05.960]   the mane is too big to lock your hands around.
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:06.800]   - Are you sure about that?
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:08.040]   'Cause the mane is just hair.
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:08.880]   - Yeah, the mane is just hair.
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:12.160]   - Yeah, it's thick hair, it's like matted hair.
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.880]   I don't know, so I think-
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:17.520]   - Do you think you can maintain back control on a lion?
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:18.640]   - Maintain, yeah, yeah.
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:23.160]   But getting there, I think I fake high, go low.
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:24.800]   Make them think I'm going for the foot or something,
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:27.000]   a little paw sweep and I take the back.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.700]   - What about a bear?
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.200]   I feel like they're easier,
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.480]   that might be easier to take, to hold back control.
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:36.440]   - Yeah, maybe, the thing is if the bear falls on its back,
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:37.280]   it's just gonna crush it.
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:40.200]   It's so big, it's substantially bigger than a lion, right?
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:41.480]   Like a full grown person.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:43.540]   - And they're also like terrifyingly like loud
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.920]   with their roars and stuff.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:46.720]   - Yeah, I think, so first of all,
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:48.840]   if I saw a grizzly, I'm like, "Oh, he's gonna attack me."
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:50.400]   I try to yell a little bit louder than them,
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:53.000]   maybe their turn a little bit, like give them a, "Oh."
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.240]   And then, yeah, for sure, I try to get behind it.
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.720]   I probably go like something weird,
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:02.160]   maybe like pull the eyes out or something, for sure.
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.520]   I mean, I'm going for the vital organs.
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:05.400]   - Play dead.
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:06.240]   - Play dead.
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:07.720]   - And then oil check it.
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:09.280]   - There's no pride in that.
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:12.240]   - Wow, pride even matters.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:14.260]   See the ego, the same advice you gave,
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:16.260]   you gotta put the ego aside with a bear.
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:20.060]   Even then, even then.
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:23.900]   Would you, how would you fight a bear or a lion?
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:24.740]   Just play dead?
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:26.180]   - Play dead, yeah.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.900]   Could you beat a kangaroo?
[02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:28.740]   A kangaroo.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.580]   - Oh yeah.
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:30.400]   - Kangaroo?
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.340]   I'd beat the shit out of a kangaroo.
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:33.180]   - Dragon?
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.140]   I mean, are we boxing gloves?
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:35.980]   We just like-
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:37.460]   - How would a kangaroo attack a human?
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:38.620]   - Try to kick him with the claws.
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:40.700]   - Knock him down and then they chug him.
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:41.540]   - Stand on that tail.
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:42.740]   - Do the kangaroos do?
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:43.980]   - They choke each other, yeah.
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.180]   - They don't choke each other.
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:46.500]   - You don't believe me?
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:47.340]   You wanna watch a video?
[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:49.080]   They choke each other out.
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:50.280]   - I've seen this, yeah.
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:51.120]   (laughing)
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:51.940]   - No?
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:52.780]   - Yeah.
[02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:53.620]   - Is this real?
[02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:54.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:55.280]   - With what?
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:56.120]   - They do this.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:56.940]   - With a headlock or what?
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:57.860]   - Yeah, they knock him and just grip like this
[02:35:57.860 --> 02:35:58.700]   and hold him.
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:35:59.540]   - What's the grip?
[02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:00.360]   - Just the handle.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:01.700]   - Like little paws, how are they gripping?
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:03.540]   - I promise you, I'm not lying to you.
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:04.380]   - Pretty sure I've seen the video.
[02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:05.980]   - They also do strange shit,
[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:06.940]   like if there's a predator around,
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:08.260]   they'll wait in a pool of water
[02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:09.860]   and then if it comes to attack, they drown it.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:10.900]   They're pretty smart.
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:14.660]   (laughing)
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:15.780]   - Okay, speaking of which,
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:17.420]   what's the most effective martial art
[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:19.140]   for winning a street fight?
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:21.100]   You talked about rule sets and streets.
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:24.060]   I think you've talked about being a street,
[02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:25.460]   have you ever been in a street fight?
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:26.660]   - Yeah, just one.
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:27.700]   - Yeah.
[02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:29.340]   - Nothing special, nothing crazy, hey.
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:31.540]   - Yeah, you don't talk about that time.
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:33.140]   Like for self-defense purposes,
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:35.980]   what would be a strategy on the street?
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:36.820]   What's advice?
[02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:37.740]   - I feel like whoever wins the street fights,
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:40.940]   whoever's willing to take it the furthest, the fastest.
[02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:41.780]   You know what I mean?
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:42.860]   If you're thinking that you're gonna box
[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:45.060]   and he's biting you, poking your eyes,
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:46.100]   that guy's gonna win.
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:47.340]   He wants it more.
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:48.180]   You know what I mean?
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:50.060]   That's why the crackheads fight.
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:52.140]   They go for the kill straight away.
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:53.940]   So I feel like it's more about
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.260]   who's willing to do the most that's gonna win that fight.
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:00.380]   - Fastest, the most fastest.
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:02.340]   - Who's got the least to lose, you know?
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:04.180]   - Yeah, we could also define winning differently
[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:06.100]   'cause you could also run away.
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:11.100]   - But in terms of technique-wise, wrestling, Judo.
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:14.740]   - I think if it's a one-on-one, I'd go wrestler wins.
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:17.440]   But if it's like multiple people,
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:19.980]   you gotta go Muay Thai, stay on your feet.
[02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:22.700]   Can't go down to the ground if it's more than one person.
[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:26.580]   - Yeah, big double leg maybe.
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:29.940]   - Yeah, double leg, put him asleep on the impact, right?
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:30.780]   Forehead to the ground.
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:31.620]   - Yeah, what's the goal here?
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:33.580]   Is to win the fight and not go to prison?
[02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:38.180]   - I haven't thought of it through that way.
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:39.740]   Yeah, certainly, yeah.
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:41.700]   Yeah, not to kill the person.
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:44.220]   - You got mutual combat here in Texas, we're good.
[02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:45.900]   - Is that in Texas?
[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:47.980]   - Do you know what the paperwork for that looks like?
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:49.180]   Do you have to actually sign something?
[02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:50.020]   Or can you just say--
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:51.260]   - I hope I don't need to find out.
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:57.140]   I did hear a story where guys were on 6th Street
[02:37:57.140 --> 02:37:57.980]   and they looked at a cop,
[02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:00.220]   they were like, "Mutual combat, mutual combat?"
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:03.420]   And just got the cops to say yes and just duked it out.
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:04.780]   That could be false though.
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:06.900]   - That sounds crazy.
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:07.740]   - I'm just saying.
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:10.660]   - I kinda admire that,
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:13.020]   but I've also been playing Red Dead Redemption recently.
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:17.860]   So I've internalized the cowboy a little too much.
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:20.700]   Just to return to gym stuff.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:23.140]   No, because it's a business,
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:25.660]   because you're running a business, there's money involved,
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:29.140]   but you're also friends, but you're also training partners.
[02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:31.620]   Is there a tension that money creates
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:33.780]   that threatens to destroy friendships?
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:36.660]   - That's something I always worry about with money.
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.860]   I try not to go do any kind of business
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:41.180]   with friends or family.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:44.460]   - I think if it were all very clear and honest and open
[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:47.780]   at the start, it makes it much easier.
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:49.420]   I think people have issues when there's like,
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.660]   kind of like things are written in fine print
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:53.500]   and nobody knows the exact answers.
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:56.940]   - And a lot of Jiu-Jitsu guys can't read.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:57.780]   You know, that makes it challenging as well.
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:38:58.860]   - We're learning that today.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:38:59.700]   - Yeah.
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:01.940]   (laughing)
[02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:03.460]   - No.
[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.780]   - It's definitely complicated though.
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:08.180]   - Yeah, I mean, it's not always obvious
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:12.060]   how to be transparent and stuff about everything.
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:14.540]   Have you felt that tension?
[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:17.980]   'Cause in the Jiu-Jitsu world, money's not really unlimited.
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:19.660]   Just running a school, what's that like?
[02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:22.060]   'Cause this is the first time you're running a school,
[02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:23.620]   running a gym.
[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:25.460]   - Yeah, I mean, it's just constantly updating people
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:29.380]   about what's going on, what your expectations are.
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:30.220]   You know what I mean?
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:32.420]   We've had some problems with coaches
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:35.900]   who I feel like think the pie is bigger than it is.
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:36.740]   You know what I mean?
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:39.460]   They feel like maybe we're getting rich out of this
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:41.140]   and they're missing out on things.
[02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:44.300]   So it's like, even amongst managing staff,
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:46.020]   that can be challenging too.
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.460]   So yeah, I mean, it's a constant work in progress
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:50.900]   to make, not only to make sure everyone's happy,
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:52.780]   but to make sure they're comfortable enough to reach out
[02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:55.220]   and tell you they're unhappy.
[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:57.340]   But I feel like those challenges are common
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:59.340]   amongst any small business.
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:02.780]   - Still, it sucks.
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:07.060]   Just to mention, I'm clueless to this,
[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:08.620]   but I'm just now learning this.
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:13.200]   Somebody I met and talked to and I really like is Isaac.
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.620]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:18.340]   - Because you're also active on Reddit.
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:19.300]   What's your name on Reddit?
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:21.100]   - Oh, John Belushi. - John Belushi's mom.
[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:22.620]   - As undercover as possible, you know?
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:23.460]   - Oh, it's not you.
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:26.480]   It's actually John Belushi's mom, right?
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.540]   So I've done my research, I guess.
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:34.700]   And I guess you guys had a falling out and have split.
[02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:36.580]   I just wanna say that, I don't know,
[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:37.980]   the few interactions I've had with him,
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:39.700]   he's a beautiful human being.
[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:41.820]   So that just shows to me-
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:43.420]   - Visually, maybe not internally.
[02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:45.820]   - And sexually, just the experience.
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:47.980]   No, he's just a kind person.
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:50.100]   I don't know, I liked him a lot.
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.200]   Like to me, in a business setting,
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:57.620]   yeah, tensions are created and it sucks.
[02:40:57.620 --> 02:40:58.860]   I don't know.
[02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:01.260]   I mean, I suppose money,
[02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:03.780]   all the stuff that happened in the jungle aside,
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:07.260]   probably money had a role to play to create extra tension.
[02:41:07.260 --> 02:41:09.700]   Money and egos about like, who is the leader,
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.180]   who is not the leader, it's tough.
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:12.740]   It's tough to manage that kind of stuff.
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:15.100]   I've seen it happen with jujitsu schools a lot.
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:17.640]   I don't know exactly what, 'cause it's like,
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:21.260]   there is also a hierarchy inside grappling,
[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:23.820]   jujitsu schools, like people that are better or not.
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:26.500]   There's literally ranks, black belt and brown belt.
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:28.340]   There's like competitors that are better.
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:31.860]   I mean, it's a weird dynamic in which to operate.
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:35.180]   'Cause like usually there's more politeness
[02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:39.740]   and like humanity layered into the way a company works.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:41.260]   But here there's just a bunch of,
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:46.260]   I mean, it's like violence laid on display, plus money.
[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:47.460]   It's crazy.
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:49.120]   Is there something you could say to that?
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:50.860]   Like how you try to minimize?
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:52.820]   Or something you wanna comment on, Isaac?
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:55.060]   - Yeah, I mean, it was unfortunate situation,
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:56.580]   but it just didn't work out.
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:59.940]   You know, like there's gonna be personality clashes.
[02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:00.940]   Some people--
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:05.260]   - I can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you.
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:06.700]   - With me? - Yeah.
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:08.340]   It's hard to imagine.
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:09.780]   - Yeah, surprising, shocking.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:12.860]   You know, I mean, I didn't even know what to say on that.
[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:15.300]   I don't wanna touch on it too much,
[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:20.300]   but obviously his expectations about his role in the gym,
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:23.100]   obviously different from ours,
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:25.980]   led to some personality clashes.
[02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:27.620]   It was sort of unresolved.
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:29.340]   Well, you know, some things happen that can't be resolved.
[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:30.780]   You can't fix those things.
[02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:34.460]   You know, obviously a lesson, I hope for both of us,
[02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:37.980]   definitely a lesson for me from a management role
[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:40.020]   to try to address these things sooner.
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:42.960]   But also sometimes I came up in a different time
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.100]   where there was no money, no opportunities.
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:49.060]   I had to pave that way totally for myself,
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:50.700]   especially coming from Australia.
[02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:54.660]   Like being a professional athlete in Jiu-Jitsu was not a thing
[02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:57.300]   so I had to pave a lot of opportunities for myself.
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:59.020]   And I feel like sometimes,
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:02.620]   oh, I don't know what the right word is.
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:04.660]   Sometimes people don't appreciate
[02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:06.540]   some of the ways you help them.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:10.620]   And they just think, feel like almost they deserve
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:12.060]   or are entitled to certain things.
[02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:15.860]   And that is very difficult to manage.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:19.460]   But I think again, like we both see the situation different.
[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:21.860]   I do hope he finds a better,
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:23.500]   a more comfortable place to train.
[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:25.180]   But yeah, obviously I've known him for a long time,
[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:27.480]   sort of like a brotherly relationship.
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:31.580]   So that's gonna really make personal problems a lot worse
[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:33.100]   when you're that close to someone, you know?
[02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:36.700]   - I just hate it that like I've seen in Jiu-Jitsu especially,
[02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:40.500]   but in other places where like close friendships
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:44.140]   were destroyed because of like gym stuff,
[02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:45.820]   like people running gyms.
[02:43:45.820 --> 02:43:50.580]   And it just, as a person who is in this case, just a fan,
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:54.860]   but in general, just like a student, it's like sucks.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:59.380]   - But again, in my position, sometimes I wonder
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:03.500]   if there really was a friendship or mere opportunity.
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:06.660]   I have to be careful of that with some people in the sport.
[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:07.500]   - It's tough, yeah.
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.900]   - Is it a sincere relationship or like,
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:11.020]   I mean, it's difficult for me to tell,
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:12.940]   or am I a means to an end?
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:16.340]   - Sure, but I think it's actually a trade-off
[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:20.100]   because I think a lot of close friendships we have,
[02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:23.940]   like even relationships we have, like when tested,
[02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:28.460]   like can break if they're not properly communicated.
[02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:30.500]   Like some of it could be just misunderstanding
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.540]   of like for a prolonged period of time.
[02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:36.740]   It's not explained through just like a lack of integrity.
[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:39.860]   It's just like you have to like talk through that shit.
[02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:41.220]   Like just be honest with each other.
[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:43.780]   - Take some MDMA and really get down to it.
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:45.140]   - Drugs solve everything.
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:47.300]   You've already heard it from this conversation.
[02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:49.540]   I've actually haven't done MDMA yet.
[02:44:49.540 --> 02:44:51.460]   People say that that's something I would enjoy a lot
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.660]   'cause my brain is, I think, natural on MDMA.
[02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:55.900]   - I'd recommend it for sure.
[02:44:55.900 --> 02:44:56.740]   - For sure.
[02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:59.900]   Is that what you did with Gabby on the L-Titan?
[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:00.740]   Okay, nevermind.
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:02.860]   - She drugs me.
[02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:07.660]   - In general, why does there always seem to be drama
[02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:08.740]   in the Jiu-Jitsu world?
[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:11.700]   Like outside of what's going on here?
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:12.540]   Or is that just--
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:14.220]   - I think it's universal to anything.
[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:15.660]   - Drama's everywhere?
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:17.580]   And then drama rises to the surface?
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:19.140]   - Drama makes the money.
[02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:21.580]   - Yeah, I wish there was a little bit less.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:25.780]   You have a bunch of, like we mentioned some of them,
[02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:27.580]   you have a bunch of instructionals out.
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:28.900]   What are some interesting things
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:32.220]   that you're looking forward to exploring
[02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:33.420]   in terms of teaching?
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:35.900]   So Just Stand Up is your most recent one, right?
[02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:38.420]   Yeah, you also have one called Power Bottom,
[02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:40.420]   an inclusive modern approach to the guard.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:41.380]   (laughing)
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:42.220]   - Yep, yep.
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:45.460]   - What are some other ones?
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:47.100]   - False Reap Allegations.
[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:48.580]   - False Reap Allegations, yeah.
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:50.140]   By the way, people talk about Power Bottom,
[02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:51.380]   again, hilarious title,
[02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:53.460]   but they say it's a really good instructional
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:54.940]   on like the guard.
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:56.780]   - Yeah, I try to at least be innovative.
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:57.940]   You know, like everyone else,
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:00.100]   I feel like's ripping off John and Gordon,
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:01.860]   putting some sort of slants on that.
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:04.420]   So I'm trying to take sort of a different approach.
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:07.860]   I think you can actively influence the sport
[02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:09.420]   with what you release,
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:10.860]   'cause people are gonna try to emulate that.
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:13.980]   So I think those type of instructionals,
[02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:15.340]   Just Stand Up, Power Bottom,
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:16.540]   like approaching the sport differently,
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:18.980]   I think definitely has a positive impact
[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:22.060]   on how people play the game.
[02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:24.700]   - Yeah, are you working on something now?
[02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:26.740]   - Probably a fundamentals course,
[02:46:26.740 --> 02:46:28.100]   just 'cause we're bringing out,
[02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:29.780]   we got the White Belt Program coming in.
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:32.420]   So I'm trying to develop a fundamentals course
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:34.660]   along the line of the constraint-based learning stuff
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:35.500]   we were talking about today,
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:38.740]   like a way to approach learning as a beginner
[02:46:38.740 --> 02:46:40.820]   to sort of speed up the process a bit
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:43.740]   and not make it as so technique dense,
[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:45.180]   at least have it a bit more fun.
[02:46:45.180 --> 02:46:48.820]   - And focusing in on just like examples of problems to solve.
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:49.660]   - Exactly, yeah.
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:51.700]   Approaching judicially learning that way.
[02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:53.780]   Like, I mean, kids learn quick through games.
[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:55.900]   I think adults are capable of that
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:57.300]   to a certain extent as well.
[02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:58.900]   - You're releasing that instructional
[02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:00.900]   on pre-match preparation?
[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:01.740]   - Yes.
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.980]   - What other stuff?
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:05.180]   Do you have anything on a body lock pass?
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:08.140]   - Yeah, I have a body lock or a body lock DVD
[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:09.500]   or instructional.
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:10.980]   Yeah, I have the pre-match ritual coming out.
[02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:14.820]   I also have, I'm filming how to build athleticism
[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:16.380]   for grappling.
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:18.340]   Just really trying to capture different angles,
[02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:19.580]   kind of like the same, you know,
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:20.820]   with Craig's zone,
[02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:22.980]   try not to do the same thing that everybody else does.
[02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:24.700]   You know, there's a ton of wrestling,
[02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:27.420]   ton of jujitsu instructional.
[02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:29.740]   - And the steroid results are coming out.
[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:30.700]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:31.700]   More plates, more dates.
[02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:33.100]   You know, Derek runs that.
[02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:36.060]   Hit me up for a blood panel test,
[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:37.300]   like an impromptu thing.
[02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:38.660]   And I did it a few days ago
[02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:40.940]   and I believe the results will come out shortly.
[02:47:40.940 --> 02:47:42.140]   - Oh yeah.
[02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:43.220]   Do you know the results?
[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:44.700]   What are you betting on, Lex?
[02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:47.060]   - What do you think?
[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:48.420]   It's hard to believe.
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:51.260]   - Yeah, it's very impressive.
[02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:53.100]   (laughing)
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:55.660]   You're putting me in an awkward position here.
[02:47:55.660 --> 02:48:02.660]   - Do you think you'll face Gordon soon?
[02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:05.580]   - I'm open to it.
[02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:08.620]   I don't know how soon, maybe in the next six months.
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:11.860]   I could see me facing him before ADCC Worlds.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.780]   - I think that's a great rivalry.
[02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:16.380]   I think it's a really interesting one.
[02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:17.300]   - It's fun for me.
[02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:24.140]   - Is there any chance that the two,
[02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:27.300]   the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany get back together?
[02:48:27.300 --> 02:48:32.060]   That DDS, under whatever name, gets back together?
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:34.740]   - No, absolutely not.
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:35.580]   - Highly unlikely.
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:39.740]   I mean, we kind of did this to back up Nicky Ryan
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:41.500]   and we're sticking with our guy.
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:44.580]   - So what do you think?
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:47.180]   - Yeah, I think there's just too many personality conflicts
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:49.100]   for it to really ever work again.
[02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:52.900]   - Do you think there will always be war in the world?
[02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:55.100]   - War?
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:48:55.940]   - Yeah.
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:58.060]   - Oh yeah, I think from the beginning of time,
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:01.340]   it's been some kind of war, some kind of battle.
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:04.540]   Controversy is what helps people evolve.
[02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:08.500]   - Until AI, super intelligent AI,
[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:11.180]   becomes way more powerful than humans
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:14.900]   and humbles all of us with his power before he destroys us.
[02:49:14.900 --> 02:49:16.460]   - Until it runs out of batteries.
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:17.460]   (laughing)
[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.500]   You guys are screwed.
[02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:20.740]   (laughing)
[02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:26.780]   - I'm really fortunate to be able to hang out with you,
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:29.580]   to train with you, and thank you so much for talking today.
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:31.340]   (laughing)
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:33.580]   - That's the best ending.
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:35.060]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:38.340]   with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan.

[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:46.060]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:49.340]   You must understand that there's more than one path
[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:51.540]   to the top of the mountain.
[02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:54.380]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
