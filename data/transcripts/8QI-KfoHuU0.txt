[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   -Well, I can't imagine a more fitting introduction to the
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   2025 Shepherds Conference than to have a choir loft filled
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   with the future teachers and preachers of God's word, singing to a
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   worship center filled with the present teachers and preachers of God's word,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and all of the thousands of men who are on this campus to lift
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   high the cross. We're so glad, and of course that's reminiscent of
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   what the Lord Jesus said in John 12 when he said, "And I, if I
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   to myself." And so how fitting that is for that truth to be
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   at the forefront of the theme of all that we're going to do here at Shepherds Conference,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   proclaiming this Christ to the ends of the earth. The Lord
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   commanded his followers to go into all the world to make disciples
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   of every nation, and the fulfillment of this great commission that
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   draws us here today remains the chief priority for all of God's people.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Our greatest motivation is the glory of Christ. Our highest
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   confidence is knowing that God has chosen to save sinners
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   from every tribe, tongue, nation, and people. And our
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   certain hope is that the multitude of the redeemed will one day
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   be gathered around the throne of heaven to reverberate
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   with ceaseless praise before the glorious Lamb. So with all
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   of that, we just want to welcome you to this Shepherds Conference, all
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   5,000 of you dispersed all throughout this campus
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   for this corporate time of worship and praise and encouragement
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and strengthening. We have all 50 states represented,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   plus Guam. We have men from 70 countries
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   here this morning. We have 700 -- yes.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yes. [Applause]
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We have 700 internationals with us,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and 1,000 of you are here for the very first time. So if this is
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   the first time you've been a guest at Shepherds Conference, would you stand so we can see where you are?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   First time, yes. Wow. Wow. [Applause]
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   [Applause]
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   [Applause]
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Welcome. This morning we have -- and we're going to begin our conference with Dr. Abner Chow,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   the president of the Master's University and Seminary. He's an elder at Grace
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Community Church, the head translator for both the Old Testament and New Testament
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   for the Legacy Standard Bible. And most importantly, he is
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   a preacher of the Word of God. But before he comes, we have
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   more to enjoy from the Master's Seminary Choir and even a moment for us all
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   to join together in song. So let's open our time in prayer
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and ask the Lord's blessing upon all we're about to do.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Almighty God, we have received our marching orders from above
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   to proclaim your Son to the ends of the earth, to stand together
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   as a willing band of brothers, to be linked with one
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   purpose, with one resolve, focused on one mission,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   to spend our lives pointing to the Lamb of God,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   to allow His excellence and grace to flow from our lips forever,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   to bring to bear upon this fallen world the truth that
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   sin can be forgiven, that hope can be renewed,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   that souls can be reborn if only they would look to the Cross
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and bow their hearts before the Champion of Heaven.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   There's no higher calling on earth than this. There's no higher mandate
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   than the one we have received from you. So help us, dear God,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   to drink deeply from the well of your Word that our time together
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   might be a refreshment to your men from the fount of every
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   blessing. May we be granted the boldness to guard the treasure that's been
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   entrusted to us, and may we be filled with the greatest of joy
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   so that one day we too might join with all who have
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   come before us and crown your Son with many crowns that
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   He alone deserves. Bless our week together, we pray, in the
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   matchless name of Christ, amen.

[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   is on the tip of everyone's tongue forever.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   It is not emblazoned in their heart forever.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   But there is one name.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   There is one name that is etched
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   in everyone's heart forever.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Friend or Foe.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And it is the one name that makes
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   all friend or foe tremble forever.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And that is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   That is what the Father does for His Son.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And that kind of endorsement,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   so fervent in the womb and with destiny
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   to this very end, is unparalleled.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   No one has endorsement like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   His redemption is absolutely exceptional.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And it's not just that it is endorsed by God.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   It is effective.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Look at verse 2.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Christ is unstoppable.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He overcomes everything.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   As it says in the text,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   He has set my mouth like a sharp sword.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   He can slice through everything,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   overcoming and having victory over all.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And He cannot be overcome.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   In the shadow of His hands,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   He has concealed me.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   God protects His Son.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   He is invulnerable.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And so He can overcome everything
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   and never be threatened at all.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   But on top of that,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Christ is God's secret weapon.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   His select or choice arrow.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Christ is the secret weapon of God.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Who does the most damage.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Who wins the battle.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Who you use at the prime moment.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And to that very end,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   as the last phrase says,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   He has hidden me in His quiver.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Christ is the one who is reserved.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   This is Galatians 4.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   For the fullness of time.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   So that the fullness of effect would happen.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   You could think of it this way.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   When Christ came into this world in His first advent,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   it was one way.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And when He left, it was different.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   That is the effectiveness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   He is God's secret weapon.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   The one who changes the tides of history.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   The one who turns the tides of the war.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   The one who sets the trajectory
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   of the plan of God.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   That is the effectiveness of Christ.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   But it's not just that He's endorsed.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   It's not just that He's effective.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   It's that He's exalted.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Verse 3. Exalted.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   He said to me,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   "Behold, I am the Lord of Israel,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   "in whom I will show forth my beautiful glory."
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   There is a term for glory
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   that refers to God's weightiness.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   The totality of His essence.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   That overpowers and overwhelms all.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   But this term refers
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   to the glory
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and the majestic nature
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   of His glory.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   We can be in awe of the power of God.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   But here is something amazing to think about.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   We should also be in awe
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   of the beauty of God.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   That He makes things
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   that are ugly and twisted
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   and perverted and seemingly
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   unsolvable.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   He makes them beautiful.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   That's the wonder
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   of His redemption.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   That's the beauty of His salvation.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   But it's not just that
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   the Messiah and His work of redemption
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   is endorsed or effective
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   or exalted.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   It is also this.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   That it required much exertion.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Verse four, "But I said,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   'I have toiled in vain. I have spent
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   my might for nothing in vanity.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Yet surely the justice due to me
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   is with Yahweh, and my
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   reward with my
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   God.'"
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Jesus labored in His
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   humanity to the
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   point where
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   it seemed to ask the
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   question, "Is this even worth
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   it? Is this even worth it?
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   What is the point of all
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   this?" He
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   exerted everything on
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   our behalf.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   And if He
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   exerted everything, if He gave His
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   all, and He is the God
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   man as we know,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   then salvation must
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   be amazing.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Because it required all
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   that He is.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And so here's the question.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   What do you give to someone
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   who is so exceptional?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   What do you give to someone who is so
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   exhaustive? What do you give to someone
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   who is the end of all things? What do you give
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   to His work that is so endorsed,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   so effective,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   so exalted, and required
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   so much exertion?
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Here's what you do. Nothing
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   short of the ends of
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   the earth. Verse six,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   He says, "It is too small
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   a thing for God."
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   He knew. He knew
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   that to give
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   the Messiah, just the nation of Israel,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   just a few peoples or nations
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   even, that would not do justice
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   to who His Son is and what
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He accomplished. That would not match
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   the value and the weightiness
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   of all that He exerted and all
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   the effect that He had. And so He says
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   this, "I will give you as a light
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   of the nations so that my
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   salvation may reach to the ends
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   of the earth."
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   At this moment, now you
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   understand. Now you understand
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   why God
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   wants the gospel to go to the
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   ends of the earth. God's
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   reason, God's motivation
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   is because of the worthiness
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   That's why He wants the gospel
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   to the ends of the earth. And that clarifies
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   everything. The nature
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   of mission, although
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   we of course want souls to be
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   saved, amen, but fundamentally
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   it is about showcasing the
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Son of God. That is God's agenda
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   in all of this. And because of
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   this, the motivation for mission
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   has to be fundamentally
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   the glory and the worthiness
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   of Christ.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Our people do not need
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   cheap tricks.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   They need Christ.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Give them Christ in His
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   exceptionalness. Make them convinced
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   that there is no one,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   no one in this world, in all history
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   past, in all history future, that could
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   ever match the Lord Jesus. Give
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   them Christ in His exhaustiveness.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Make our people
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   understand that all history
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   and all theology is
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   predicated upon His shoulders.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   He is the decisive hero of heroes.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Give them Christ that He is the
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   end of all things. All things will
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   be around Him. All things will be focused
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   upon Him and therefore He must be
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   the focus now. Give them Christ
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   in His endorsement by God
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   because He is God Himself.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Give them Christ in His
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   effectiveness. Make them understand
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   that He is the secret weapon of God,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   the one who turns the tides of everything,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   the hinge and the lynchpin of
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   all redemptive history. Give them
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Christ in His exaltedness
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   that He is not only powerful but
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   beautiful and makes all things beautiful.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Give them Christ in His
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   exertion for us. Crush our
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   people with the reality that He was crushed
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   for us. Give them
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Christ until they can no
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   longer contain themselves and
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   they are so captured and all
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   of their affections are bound to Him
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   that they say, "Give me
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   this world or I die."
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   That is what we
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   need. Give them
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Christ.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   [applause]
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   [applause]
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Our people don't need
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   cheap tricks.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   They don't need to be manipulated.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   They need Christ
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   and when they
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   have Him, and when
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   they behold Him, and
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   when they are captured by Him,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   they will go.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   They will go because
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   they cannot stop from going.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   And that is what the apostles
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   understood when
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   they heard the phrase
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   "to the ends of the earth."
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   They knew the greatness of the redemption that
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   their Lord had just procured.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   They knew how effective it was.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   They knew how exalted it was.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   They knew how endorsed it was,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   and therefore they knew they had
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   to go. They understood
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   they had to go.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Why do we go?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Because of the greatness of His
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   redemption.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Well, we don't just go because of the greatness
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   of His redemption.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Second of all, we go because of the
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   greatness of His reign.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   We go because of the greatness of His reign.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Turn with me to Psalm 72.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Psalm 72.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Verse 8 of Psalm
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   72, it says this,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   "May He also have dominion from sea
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   to sea, and from the
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   river," and here's the key phrase,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   "to the ends
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   of the
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   earth." We hear the
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   phrase again.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   In Psalm 72, in context, it is the
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   climax of all of David's prayers,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   and it is what Solomon had
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   recorded down as they
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   contemplate, "What is it going to take?
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   What is it going to take to fulfill
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   the role of a Davidic king? What is it going
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   to look like when the Messiah
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   reigns ultimately?"
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And Psalm 72 gives us that picture.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   It tells us in verse
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   1 that the Messiah will have a faithful
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   reign. It says this,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   "O God, give the king your judgments
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   and your righteousness to the king's
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   son."
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   In this wicked world, in this
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   fallen place, we
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   often have to settle
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   for a modicum
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   of justice, for a modicum
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   of righteousness in our political
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   system, and we're so thankful to the Lord
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   if justice and righteousness
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   are at least preserved to
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   a small degree.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   But there will be a day,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   there will be a day, when
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   we never have to settle for less.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   There will be a day when
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   the complete divine justice
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   and the complete divine
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   righteousness of God will reign
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   unhindered and in fullness.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   That is the faithful reign of the Lord
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Jesus Christ.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   And it's not just that. Look at verse 2,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   "May he render judgment to your people
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   with righteousness, and you're afflicted with
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   justice." So often in this life,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   even though the movies say the good guys always
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   win, we know the good guys
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   don't really win a lot.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   The bad guys always have the
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   upper hand. But there will be
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   a day when the good guys
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   always win. When
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   good will always triumph over evil
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   in the end. And that is the faithful
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   reign of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Christ does not just have a faithful
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   reign. He has a fruitful reign.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Verse 3, "Let the mountains
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   lift up peace to the people,
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   and the hills in righteousness."
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Christ's
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   reign is so amazing, as we heard in Isaiah.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   It not only rules over
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   nations, it transforms creation.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Even the mountains, even the
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   hills. Let me put it this way.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   You and I have never seen
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   this world as
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   God originally intended.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   You have only seen it.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   And you might say, "I enjoy some things
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   in this world. I behold the majesty
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   and beauty of God in this world." True,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   but you have never seen it
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   the way it was supposed to be.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   We look forward
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   to the day when creation
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   isn't just not so bad,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   or okay,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   or even nice.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   We look forward to the day
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   when, as the text says,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   it is full of righteousness and peace.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Where you
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   see this world like you've never seen
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   it before. And you've experienced
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   this land like you've never experienced
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   it before. That is the
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   fruitful reign of the Lord
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   Jesus.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   You might say, some people will say, "Well, of course,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   you can make the world a nice place, but people
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   will ruin the world." Okay.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Christ has an answer to that, verse 4.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   "May He give justice to the afflicted
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   of the people, save the children
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   of the needy, and crush
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   the oppressor."
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   God will make sure all the people of the world
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   are right. If you are harmed,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   you will be satisfied. If you are needy,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   you will be filled. And if you are
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   one who harms,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   you will be dealt with.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Christ will have the most fruitful
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   reign for the earth
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   and its fullness.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   And it's not just a faithful reign,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   and it's not just a fruitful reign,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   it is a fearsome reign. Look at verse 5.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   "Let them fear you while the
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   sun endures, and as long as the moon
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   from generation to all generations."
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   The world will fear
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Christ at this time.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   And it will be unceasing
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   and forever.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   It will be constant.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   And lest you think
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   people are just scared
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   of Jesus because
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   He is so wrathful,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   and the risk of punishment is so great,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   notice verse 6.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   "May He come down like rain
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   upon the mown grass."
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Jesus at that time,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   He won't be fearful
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   in the sense of terrorizing.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   He will be the greatest blessing.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   He'll be like the new day dawn
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   and the dew of the new day.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   He'll be the most rejuvenating.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   He'll be the most healing.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   He'll be the most sustaining.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Let me put it this way.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   We understand fear
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   of people who could
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   hurt us. We understand
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   fear of people
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   who could punish
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   us.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   But there's a different category of fear.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Being so
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   fearful, being nervous,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   being in awe of one
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   who is not so
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   harmful, but one
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   who is so good.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   And at this time,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   the world will have a fear
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   they have never known before.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   A fear not
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   of risk of punishment,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   a fear of one who is so good,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   like the dew on the
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   new grass. That
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   is the fearsome reign
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   of the Lord Jesus.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Well, it's not just a faithful
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   and a fearsome and a fruitful
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   reign. It is a reign of fulfillment.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Notice verse 9. "Let the desert
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   creatures kneel before him,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   and his enemies lick the dust."
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Where have we talked about
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   serpents licking dust? At people's feet.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   At the one, the seed's
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   feet. Genesis 3,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   15.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   This reign will fulfill
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   all the promises of God. This reign
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   will overcome evil, sin,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   and death. This reign
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   will fulfill all the promises
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   all the way back to the very first
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   promise made. And there is a
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   reason for this. There is a reason
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   why this reign is so fruitful and
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   so faithful and so fearsome
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   and fulfills all promises.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   This is the rule, according to
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   David and Solomon, of the final
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Adam. This is the rule
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   of the final Adam. Verse
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   8. The text that we are focusing
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   on for this point. May he also
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   have dominion. Key word
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   right there. The word dominion
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   in the Old Testament is exclusively
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   and first used with the reign of
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Adam. Let him have dominion
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   over this earth.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   And then from that point forward, it is
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   exclusively used in
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   messianic prophecy. Numbers
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   24. Balaam and his talking
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   donkey. What does Balaam say?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   He says, "The one who rises
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   from Jacob, the star that ascends from
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Jacob, he will have dominion."
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   That is messianic.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Psalm 110. We know that's a messianic
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   prophecy. "The Lord said to my Lord,
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   'Sit at my right hand.'" That is a
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   messianic prophecy, and it says in there, "Have dominion
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   over your enemies."
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Here, this is a
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   messianic prophecy. May he also have
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   dominion. What kind of dominion?
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   The dominion Adam had.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   The dominion Adam had. And how did
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Adam rule as
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Adam was commissioned? He
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   ruled over the earth, and therefore
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   what does the text say?
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   "And from the river to the ends
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   of the earth."
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Here's what Solomon
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   and David understood. What it's going
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   to take to fulfill the Davidic
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   role, what it's going to take to fulfill
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   the Davidic covenant, is one
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   who has the original authority.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   The one commissioned by God.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   The prime authority. The
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   ultimate authority. The one given
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   to Adam himself. And the one
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   who will have this authority
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   must not be like Adam.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   He must fulfill everything that
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Adam was not. He is the final
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   Adam. And because he is the final
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Adam, he possesses that singular,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   unique, original,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   ultimate, prime
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   authority. And that authority means
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   and demands, he owns
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   and dictates every
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   single thing to the ends
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   of the earth.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   That is the sovereignty of
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   the Lord.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Why we go to the ends
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   of the earth? It's simple.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   We go everywhere Christ reigns.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   We go everywhere
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Christ rules. Does he rule there?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Yes, we are there. And we are
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   declaring Christ. Does he rule over there?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   Yes, we declare Christ.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   We go everywhere
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Christ rules.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   And his authority,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   such authority that dictates
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   and determines the ends of the earth,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   is what backs the very mission
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   that we engage in. This is the very logic
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   of Matthew 28. And to
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   be clear, Jesus' statement,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   "All authority has been
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   given to me," is not just
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   a validation of
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   missions, even though that is the case.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   That declaration is the
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   ontological reality, the
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   right and prerogative of Jesus,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   by who he is and what he has done,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   that all authority belongs to him.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   He is the king of this world, and
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   every land to the ends of the earth
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   owes him their allegiance, because
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   he is the only king.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   That is the statement Jesus made in Matthew
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   28, and that is what drives
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   everything. Brothers, I know
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   that in ministry
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   things can be hard,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   and people can be resistant,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   and we can get knocked down
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   often as we labor for the
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Lord Jesus Christ. But what gets
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   us back up, what
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   allows us to continue forward,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   is us knowing this,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   that the detractors, they do not
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   have the last say.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   They do not have the final say. And in fact,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   let's be clear, we don't have the last say.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   It's not as if we just wield
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   all this power autonomously and
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   can do whatever we want and take over the world. That is
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   not what is going on. But we serve
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   the king who does have the last say.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And in fact, he has
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   the only say. He is
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   the Lord of heaven and earth,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   even to the ends of the earth.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   That's why we get back up.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   That's why we continue on.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Because he has decided the
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   battle. And not only
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   does the authority, the reign
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   of Christ, give us authority,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   it authorizes us to.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Sometimes we, or perhaps our people,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   can feel, "I don't know
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   if I should talk to so-and-so about it."
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   It could feel a little awkward. Maybe
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   they don't, maybe that's just really not the
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   topic for discussion with them.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   And of course,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   we don't want to be belligerent, and we don't want to be pugnacious.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   That would go against the orders of
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   our king. But we have to understand
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   this. Who sets the topic
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   of discussion? The king.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   He owns all
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   those people. He owns all
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   those places. And if he says,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   "This is the topic for discussion,"
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   then guess what? It's the topic
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   for discussion. It is authorized.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   We are just announcing for
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   the king, and he has set the agenda,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   and we follow him.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Now, speaking
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   of announcing for the king,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   this is helpful,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   I think, encouraging, particularly
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   for our people, to understand,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   in light of the context that we are in,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   the nature of evangelism.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   The very word, euangelizo,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   means to announce, to proclaim
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   good news.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   It depicts one, just like the context here,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   who goes before as a herald
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   of the king, announcing and declaring
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   his victory.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Sometimes our people get so
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   discouraged and decline to evangelize
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   because
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   they think they fail if somebody doesn't
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   get converted after
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   their presentation, their proclamation.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And so they just shy away from it
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   because they just don't want to keep failing.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   That's not
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   the standard of success.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   The activity the king has commissioned
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   is not conversion, even though we want
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   people to be converted. The activity
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   is declaration.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Declaration. Let me put it this way.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   Recently,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   in America, we
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   had an event that I learned much about.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   It's called the Super Bowl.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   And at this
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   event, there is
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   commercials.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   And at this event, there is food and
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   fellowship. And at this event,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   there is something called football.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   Which is not the football celebrated
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   by the world. It's distinctly American
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   football. I like it.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   And what I learned about this
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   event is that there are winners.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   And then, there are people who get
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   participation trophies. No, I'm just kidding.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Winners
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   and losers.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   And the team that wins, their fans
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   and their people take to the streets
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   and they celebrate the win. And they
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   parade the win.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   Now, if you went up to them
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   and said, "Is this parade
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   successful if only it
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   makes converts to your team?"
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   They'd look at you like
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   you are crazy! Because
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   you are! That is not
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   the criteria for success
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   of declaration. The criteria
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   for success is what? Declaration!
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   They don't care
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   if somebody joins the fanbase
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   of their team. That's wonderful.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   What they care about is announcing
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   the win. Brothers,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   we have to be clear with our people.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Let's just help them out. Our success
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   rate at conversion is exactly
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   0.00%.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   We don't
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   convert anybody. The Lord
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   does that. But if our people
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   and we declare Christ
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   in His death and resurrection,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   if we declare Christ and His salvation
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   from our sins, then we have
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   a 100% success rate
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   every single time. That's what we have to
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   remind them.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   We go everywhere
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   Christ reigns.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   And that's what His disciples understood.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   They understood
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   that the King has called them
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   to announce Him. And
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   He has done so with full authority
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   and full authorization. And whether people
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   like it or not, that's okay.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   They still announce. They may be the
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   smell of life to those who live and the smell
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   of death to those who perish, but that
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   is the call. Because we are
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   announcing the King. Because He reigns
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   to the ends of the earth.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Finally,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   here's a final reason.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   We don't just
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   go because of the
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   greatness of His redemption
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   or the greatness of
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   His reign.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   We go because of the greatness
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   of the reward for Him.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   The greatness of the reward
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   for Him. Turn with me to
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   Psalm 22.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   Psalm 22.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   Verse 27
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   says the phrase,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   "All the ends
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   of the earth will remember
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   and turn
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   to Yahweh."
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   We have the phrase
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   there again. And we know Psalm
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   22. We know Psalm
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   22.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   It is the suffering of our
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Lord. Immense
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   suffering. "My God,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   my God, why have you
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   forsaken me?"
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   We know that.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   And there is intense suffering of Christ.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   You could say it's
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Him physically and personally.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Verse 14,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   "I'm poured out like water.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   All my bones are out of
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   joint. My heart is like
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   wax. It is
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   melted within me. My strength
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   is dried up like a potsherd, and
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   my tongue cleaves to my jaws."
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   This is the
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   pain of execution. The most
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   excruciating execution.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   But it's not just physically and personally.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   It's even interpersonally.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   What are people doing around
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   the Lord Jesus?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   "Be not
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   far from me, for distress is near." Verse 11,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   "For there is none to help."
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   Total shunning.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Total shame.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Total isolation.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   And those who are around
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   are in total
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   antipathy against Him.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   "Many bulls have surrounded me." Verse 12,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   "Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   They open their mouths wide at me."
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Just shunning. Just hatred.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   Just oppression.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   Just opposition.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   And He bore that.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   But what drives all of that
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   is, of course,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   the ultimate suffering.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   The wrath of God.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   "My God,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   my God, why have you
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   forsaken me?"
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   And with that
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   question, "Why?"
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   Jesus expresses
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   what human language
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   and all words and all
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   tongues that have ever existed
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   in this planet can never
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   express, for there are no
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   words and no terms that can
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   ever adequately convey
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   the intense, excruciating suffering
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   and agony of our Lord.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   There are no words that can explain that.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   No words that can express that.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   And with the question, "Why?"
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   Jesus conveys
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   such unparalleled agony.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   And at the same time,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   He asks the question,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   "Why is this happening?"
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   What's the purpose?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   What's the point?
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   What's the goal?
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   And what we often forget
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   as we study Psalm 22, we focus
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   so much on the first part
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   that we forget that there's a second part
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   and actually gives an answer.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Look at verse 22 of Psalm 22.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   It
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   says this,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   "I will surely recount
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   your name to my brothers."
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Two interpretive
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   tips for Psalm 22
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   at this point. Interpretive
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   tip number one.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   When you are
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   executed, you die.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   It's not hard
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   to understand. When you are
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   executed, by nature and
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   definition of execution,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   you die.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   When someone drowns,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   they pass away. When somebody is electrocuted,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   they die. When somebody says,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   "Man, I killed him dead!"
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   That would be true. I mean, is there
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   any other way to do that?
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   When you are executed,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   you die.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Okay. Tip number
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   two. Verse 22.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   "I will surely recount your name to my brothers."
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   When you are still talking,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   you are not dead.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   You are
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   not even mostly dead.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   So,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   let's ask the question, "Jesus
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   is executed, so he should be what?"
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   Dead. But he's still
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   talking, so he can't be what?
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   Dead. What is this moment looking
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   at? Not his death, but his what?
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Resurrection. In fact,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   this moment is looking at the
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   eschatological resurrection that his
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   resurrection drove.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Notice what the text
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   says. That the
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   afflicted will eat, verse 26, and be
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   satisfied. May your heart
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   live forever. And then even
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   later on, it says in verse 29,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   "All those who go down to the dust will
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   bow before him." How can you go down to the dust
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   and die and yet bow before him? Even the one
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   who cannot keep his soul alive because they were raised
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   from the dead.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   This is a moment that looks
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   to the future. This is a moment that looks
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   to eschatology. And in this
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   moment, Jesus is surrounded by
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   people. He's the leader of them all, as he
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   surely recounts God's name
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   to his brothers in the midst of assembly.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   He will praise God because
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   he is the one who is the one
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   leading praise, and he is the one explaining
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   salvation. Verse 24, "For he has
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   not despised, and he has not abhorred
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   the afflicted of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his face
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   from him. But when he cried to him for help, he
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   heard." But it's not just at this time
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   that Israel's gathered around
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Jesus and worshiping him and being
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   led by him, and he's the center of everything.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   It is this, verse 27, "All
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   the ends of the
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   earth will remember
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   and turn to
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   Yahweh." Here is the picture,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   prophetic picture of Psalm 22.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   There will be a day when Christ
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   returns, and he will set up his
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   kingdom in Jerusalem. And at
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   that time, it will not just be Israel
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   surrounding him. It will be
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   the ends of the earth, from
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   one end of heaven to the other end
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   of heaven, from one horizon to
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   the next. You will only see
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   people, people of every
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   nation, tribe, and tongue, filling
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   all the land that is
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   available on this earth,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   and every continent that is on
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   this earth. Throughout history,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   God has preserved a remnant,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   and we've always been small, and we've
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   always been few, and we've always been
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   the minority. But on that day,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   the remnant will become the absolute
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   majority, and we will fill the
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   earth. And all eyes will
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   be focused on Christ. Notice
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   what the text says. All the ends of the
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   earth will remember. What will we remember?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   We will remember our sin. We will know
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   finally how weighty it is, how
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   disgusting it is to God, and we will remember
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   what the Lord has done for us.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   All that it took, all the sacrifice,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   all the effort, all the
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   work to secure our liberation
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   from sin and Satan and
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   death and the very wrath of God, and we
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   will remember that. And therefore, we will
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   turn to Christ.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   We will turn and face Him everywhere,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   from one end of heaven to the other
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   end of heaven, to the very ends of the earth.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   All the nations, all the
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   people, all the elect will be
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   facing Christ in Jerusalem.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   All eyes on Him. And because
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   we are so overcome with who
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   He is, and so overcome with
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   what He has done for us, and all His glory,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   then what will happen? All
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   the families of the nations, as the text says, will
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   worship, literally in Hebrew, bow
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   down before Him. The whole world
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   at one moment will bow
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   to the Savior. And we will
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   declare with our heart all
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   glory, honor to the Lamb, and
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   salvation belongs to Him
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   alone. That is what will happen
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   on that day. And
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   at that moment, and at that
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   moment, we know the answer
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   to the question, "My God,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   my God, why have you
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   forsaken me?" Here's
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   the answer. Praise to
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   the ends of the earth. That
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   is why. They
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   are why.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   We are
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   why. This
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   is the reward of the
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Son. And here's what's beautiful.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Isaiah prophesies
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   this in Isaiah 53. He
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   says this,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   "That on that day, the
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   servant will see his seed,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   as the whole world bows
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   before Him, from one end of
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   heaven to the other end of heaven."
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   He
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   will see His seed, all
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   the elect that He bought from every
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   nation, tribe, and tongue.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   And here's what Isaiah says, "His
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   soul will
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   be satisfied."
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   You
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   say,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   "I love that. I want
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   Him to be that honored."
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Me too. That's
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   why we go. That's why
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   we go. We don't just go
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   because His redemption deserves it.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   That's true. We don't just go because His
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   reign demands it. That's true.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   We go because that's
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   His reward. And if we can participate
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   in that, in an act of gratitude,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   in an act of love to our Savior,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   we go. We proclaim
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   Him because we love the Lord
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   Jesus. And anything that will
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   bring Him honor, and everything that
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   will bring Him praise, we are for
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   with all of our heart because we
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   love Christ.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   That's why we
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   go.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   And so,
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   on that day when Acts
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   1-8 occurred,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   and Christ uttered His
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   commission, the disciples
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   understood why they go.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   You could put it this way,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   because redemption
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   goes to the ends of the
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   earth, and because
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   His reign of Christ
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   goes to the ends of the earth,
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   and because His reward is to
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   the ends of the earth,
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   then we go
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   to the ends of the
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   earth.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   And of course,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   God doesn't need us. He doesn't
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   depend on us for this.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   He just
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   graciously allowed us to participate
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   because
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   we are so captured to His Son,
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   because we understand
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   what He deserves, and we understand
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   what His reign demands, and we
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   have this intense delight in Him.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   And so, of course,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   we go with all joy
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   because this is a privilege.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   Let me
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   just say one more remark.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   It's not just
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   that the redemption
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   deserves it. It's not
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   just that His reign demands it.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   It's not just that His reward
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   causes us to delight in Him
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   to do it. It's this.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   The results are
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   decided. The
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   results are decided.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   Isaiah
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   49, Psalm
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   72, Psalm 22,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   they're all prophecies.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   They're all telling us
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   exactly what is going to happen
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   in the future. Brothers,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   the outcome has been decided.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   The outcome is sure.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   If you are going to
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   the field, if we are engaging
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   in the ministry, we have to
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   know, yes, we may take some
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   hard knocks. We may have suffering.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   We may be in over our heads.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   But in the end, the result is sure.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   The outcome is sure.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   So we hang in there, and we do all
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   that we can, because we know that the
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   battle will be won for the Lord Jesus,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   and the gospel will go to the ends of the earth.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   And if we are part of that, and we
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   contribute to that, whatever the Lord decides,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   it is worth it to us.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   And so, because of such a great redemption,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   and because of such a great reign,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   and because of His great reward,
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   may it be, brothers, that we do
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   not rest until Christ is
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   proclaimed to the ends of
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   the earth.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   Shall we pray?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Our God and Father,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   may Your Son be honored and glorified.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   May His transcendence
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   and supremacy be burned
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   and etched into our hearts,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   put deeply into our soul,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   until, indeed,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   we cry out the words,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   "Give us this world for
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   Christ, or we die."
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   May it be that
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   our hearts endeavor, for the
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   sake of Your Son, for the sake of
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   the honor that is due to Him,
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   that we labor on and ministry
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   faithfully to the end, even
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   to the ends of the earth.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   We give Him all praise
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   and honor now, and it is in
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Your name we pray. Amen.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   [applause]
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   Thank you, Dr. Chao. What an
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   amazingly powerful way
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   to start our conference this
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   morning, by giving such glory
