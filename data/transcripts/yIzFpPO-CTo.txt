[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   If you're a U.S. citizen, if you're in the United States, you live in the most dynamic
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.920]   economy in the world, the best possible place to be an investor.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.280]   And if you're investing in the S&P 500 or the total stock market index, by definition
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.780]   those largest companies are international businesses.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.100]   So you have international exposure, but you have it at the least possible cost and you
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.640]   have it in the country that has the best regulations around investments.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760]   So your investments are as clear as they can be, whereas in some international markets
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.960]   they're a little more opaque.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.960]   So for that reason, I don't see the need to be in international funds.
