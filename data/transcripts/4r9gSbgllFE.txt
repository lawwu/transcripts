[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the first epistle of Peter, in the first chapter,
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.200]   and the section that runs from the thirteenth verse to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.000]   Let me read again verse thirteen.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But as I say, I'm anxious once more to call attention to the great message which is to be found in this section.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Now we are looking at this section of scripture for the fourth time.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And we are doing so, as I have been saying, because it is such a wonderful exposition of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   We have seen that it starts, as it were, by a call and an exhortation to us to gird up the loins of our mind.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   This isn't some sob stuff. This isn't some emotionalism.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We are here looking into one of the grandest and the greatest, the greatest truth that the world has ever known or ever can know, the truth of God.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So we've considered that exhortation to gird up the loins of our mind.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And as I say, we have seen that the reason for doing so is that here we've got something that tells us about the very thing that we stand most in need of, salvation.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You remember how he puts it there in verse 10, "of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you," and so on.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We've looked at this great movement of salvation, planned by God before the foundation of the world, manifested in time in the coming of the Son of God into the world, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   His death, his resurrection, his ascent and return to heaven, that mighty movement, that great plan, that eternal scheme that is so marvellous that the angels are stooping down and looking into it in wonder and in amazement.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And then, last Sunday, we went a step further.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We imagine somebody saying, "Well, that's all right, but it doesn't interest me. I don't see why I should pay any attention to that, why I should consider it."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And now we are looking at some of the reasons that are adduced by the apostle for our girding up the loins of our mind and calling all our faculties into operation that we may look into this plan of salvation.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And the first reason we considered last Sunday night was this. It is because we need to be delivered out of the kind of life we all live by nature, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We should look at this great salvation were it merely that it offers to deliver us from the appalling, debased kind of life that all the human race lives by nature as the result of the fall and of sin.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That in itself, in many ways, is sufficient as a reason for our looking into this and considering it with all our might and may.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But the apostle gives us further reasons, so it's our business to follow him and to consider them.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And tonight we come to a second reason that he gives us for paying great attention to this.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I repeat my phrase, "girding up the loins of our mind."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   We'll need every bit of mind we've got. We'll need our every faculty and all our understanding and all our ability.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Well, what is this second reason?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It is, as he points out, the precarious position in which we are.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Indeed, the terrible danger in which we all are in this life and in this world until we believe and are saved and redeemed by this salvation.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Now then, it is to that that I'm anxious to call your attention this evening.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And again, I'm going to do so in the very terms that are used here by this apostle Peter.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We could go beyond it. I shall show you parallel statements.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But we're going to look at the phrases and the expressions that are used by the apostle himself.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   He really does put it all together here in one paragraph, in one statement.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Now then, I say, our precarious, our dangerous position.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   How does he put that to us?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, let me pick out one phrase which he uses.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   This is how he puts it here in verse 17.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   pass the time of your sojourning here in fear."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Why should I be bothered to listen to this, says someone?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Well, here is the apostle's first answer.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You are only in this world for a while.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You're merely sojourning here.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You're not here forever.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Of course, if a man had got an endless lease on life,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   and if he knew that he was to be in this world forever and forever,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   he might say, "Well, I needn't be bothered about that now.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   There are many things I want to do, and I want to have a bit of enjoyment.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I want to have a good time.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Perhaps sometime when I've got a convenient season, I might look into that and consider it."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But my dear friend, that isn't your position at all.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Pass the time of your sojourning here.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's all it is.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You notice he puts it in the same way towards the end of the chapter.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Listen, he says, "All flesh is as grass,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and all the glory of men as the flower of grass.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's it.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   He then goes on in the next chapter, and he puts it like this, in verse 11.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Dearly beloved," he says, "I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Strangers and pilgrims.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That is all we are in this world.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   This apostle was very fond of this idea.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   He could never get rid of it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You see, in his second epistle, he writes, "He's an old man.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   He's facing the end of his life."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   He says, "Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   though ye know them and be established in the present truth."
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yeah, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   As long as I'm in this tent.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   What is my life in this world?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   What is indeed this body of mine?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, it's only a tent, you know.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's not a very durable edifice.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's not a building set up upon the rock of ages,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and built of granite and of marble, and of marvelous stones.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   No, no, it's a tent-like existence.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Very tenuous.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Always moving.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Can be blown over.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Not a permanent residence.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We are away from home.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   We are living in tents.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   We are moving.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Moving.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I nightly move.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Pitch my moving tent.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   A day's march nearer home.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's his language you see everywhere.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   James, of course, says the same thing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   He stops and says, "What is your life?"
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And the end says, "It is but a vapour."
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It's but a vapour.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Like a breath of air.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   That's what your life is.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   That's what my life is.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's the time of your sojourning here.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   We are only here for a while.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Change and decay in all around I see.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Had you realized that about yourself, my dear friend?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Do you remind yourself of that daily as this apostle did?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   That you're only in a tent?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Your whole future may be changed in a moment.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   You never know when.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   If we did know when, of course, it would be so different.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   But we never know when.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It may come at any moment.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   The summons to move, strike tent, move on.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It may come at any moment.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   We don't know.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Here are we no continuing cities.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This sounds so obvious, doesn't it?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And yet I venture to suggest to you
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   that the major cause of most of our failure in life
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   is due to our failure to realize this most obvious fact.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   That we are but sojourners here.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Strangers and pilgrims.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Here today, gone tomorrow.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   In the midst of life, we are in death.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   These are the terms.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Every man that lives is born to die.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That's it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Past the time of your sojourning here,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   you know you can't afford to sit back.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You can't afford to be a mere spectator.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You can't afford to take a dilettante, detached view
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   of this great question of life and death and eternity and salvation.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Why?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Well, because you're in it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   You're involved in it.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   You're not looking at a film that passes by.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You're not looking at your television.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You're looking at yourself.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You are the actor. You're involved in it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And we are merely temporary visitors, as it were, in this world.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Brief life is here our portion.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Three-score years and ten, perhaps a little more.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You've heard the announcement about Remembrance Sunday.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Yes, here it is.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Well, now then, I'm merely starting with this.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   This, you see, is the point.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Whenever we consider a message such as this,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   we should be considering it in the light of this.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We should be listening to it as men and women
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   who realise that we may be listening to it for the last time.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   We don't know. I don't know.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But it's a possibility.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   We're only sojourners at best.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And we, none of us, know when we're going to leave,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   when we go out, when we make our exodus.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Pass the time of your sojourning here.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   While you're in this tent, remember that you're but in a tent.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And that you'll have to move on, as everybody else will have to move on.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Well, there is his first statement, and it's a most solemn one.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It's a great theme in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That is, of course, why the Bible is the profoundest book of philosophy
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   in the whole universe at this moment.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   The Bible, from beginning to end, emphasises the thing
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   that always should come first in any philosophical system.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Which is this.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   That man is mortal.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   That man is only here for a moment.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   That man is always moving.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And that there's nothing static about him, or about the whole of his life.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Pass the time of your sojourning here.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Now, that is his first statement, but then I want to hold a second one before you.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Here, the apostle tells us in the 20th verse about our Lord's way of redemption,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   who verily, he says, was foreordained before the foundation of the world.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   But was manifest in these last times, for you. Last times.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Which might be translated like this, the end of the times.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   In this last age, or in this end of the ages time.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now I want to take that phrase, and I want to put it with another phrase
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   that the apostle uses in verse 13.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Wherefore God, up the lines of your mind, be sober and hope to the end for the grace
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Keep these in your mind. Last times, revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Or take it as he puts it in verse 7.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That the trial of your faith, he says, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   The appearing, or the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Last times, appearing of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   What is he talking about?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Well, here again is one of these profound themes in the Bible.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And oh, how it is being sadly forgotten and neglected by the vast majority of people.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   What's he talking about?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Well, you see, the Bible divides up time in its own way.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And obviously it's the only realistic way of doing so.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   The world in its various theories about time always contradicts itself.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   It doesn't understand this question of time.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The highest wisdom of the natural men about time is probably that which says
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   that it's a matter of circles, that it just goes round and round in circles.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Which makes you feel that you're advancing when you're going up one side,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   but it doesn't, because when you get there you begin to go round the other side,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and round and round you go.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Nothing new unto the heavens, nothing new unto the sun.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   What has been shall be, and what is, has been and shall be again.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   That's the human wisdom on this matter of time.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   But you know, the Bible doesn't look at time like that at all.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It says, you know, until Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   there was a sort of age, there was a time.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   There was a whole sector, a section of time.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And it was all looking forward to him, and he was going to make a climactic difference.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And you find everything looking forward to that time, to that age.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Well, he came.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And therefore he is coming as introduced a new section, a new sector of time.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And the Bible calls this the last time.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Why does it call this?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Well, it calls it that for this reason,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that we are living in an age which is going to lead us to the end of time.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Now, you couldn't say that about that first period,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   because that wasn't looking forward to the end of time.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   That was looking forward to the Incarnation.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   That was looking forward to the Manifestation, the first appearing of the Son of God.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But now, his having come, he has put us into a period in which we are looking forward to the end.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   This is the last time.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   We are in the last times, in the last age.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's leading to what? To the end of time.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   To the final consummation.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And you notice that its way of putting it is this.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That this selfsame Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   who came into this world nearly two thousand years ago, and lived and died,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and rose again, and went back into heaven,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and is seated at the right hand of God's glory and power,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   that he's coming back into this world.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And he's coming back, as I'll tell you in a moment, to do certain things.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   But he's coming back, that's the great thing.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And he's coming back in order to end time, to end the universe as we know it,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and to inaugurate an eternal age, an eternal state.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   "But what is that to do with me?" says someone.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Ah, my dear friend, what it has to do with you is this.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   That when he comes back, when Jesus Christ appears,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   there will be a general resurrection of the good and of the bad.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Of you, and of me, and of everybody else.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Now let me read to you the words of our Lord himself,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   in which he states this so plainly in the gospel according to Saint John in chapter 5.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Listen to these verses, I begin to read at verse 24.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life."
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Then he goes on.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and hath also given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of men.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   they that have done good unto the resurrection of life,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation."
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   You noticed it, didn't you?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   "All that are in the graves shall hear his voice."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Why should I listen to this gospel, says somebody?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Why should I be bothered about all this?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   My philosophy is, while I'm in this world, I'll make the best of it, eat good, eat, drink and be merry.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I'll have a good time, because I know I've got to die.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You're perfectly right in your first point.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I know that everybody's got to die, and I've got to die.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I'll be dead soon enough, that's why I don't think about it.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Why go and anticipate it and make myself miserable?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die, and then that's the end.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I'll be buried in a grave, but is that the end?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   No, no, says this message.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You haven't finished there, you see.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   You haven't got out of it.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   That's the fallacy of the poor suicide.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   He thinks he's finished, but he hasn't.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Buried in a grave? No, no.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "The day is coming when all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they'll all rise."
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The good and the bad.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Everybody without any distinction.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   This is a great theme, a great message that runs right through the Bible, particularly in the New Testament.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   The book of Revelation has got it.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "The day that is coming when the books shall be opened, and all shall appear before the Judge, the dead, wherever they are, from the depths of the sea, from the graves, from everywhere.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   They shall rise, and those that remain will be changed, and they'll all appear, and the books will be opened, and the sentences will be promulgated."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Did you hear it in that discourse about the sheep and the goats in the 25th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   My dear friend, here it is. Peter reminds us of it.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Why should I listen to this?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Well, I'll tell you why you listen to this.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Because, you know, you can't get away from it.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   You can turn your back on it in this world, and you can die turning your back upon it, be buried in a grave.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But, you know, you'll be raised, and you'll have to face it again.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   That is what makes it so solemn.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That is what I sometimes feel makes this work of preaching almost too terrible to continue with it.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   These words will come back.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We are living in the last time, the end of the ages.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And we are going towards that final consummation, the end of time, when the scroll of time will be rolled up finally, and time shall be no more.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And that, I am emphasizing, ushers in the resurrection.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   He is already risen. All shall rise and appear before God.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Very well, that brings me to the next term that the apostle uses here.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   His next term, you notice, is the term 'judgment'.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Listen to him in verse 17. "And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, cast the time of your sojourning here in fear."
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You see, he couldn't get away from this idea. That's why I read you that portion out of the fourth chapter also.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   You see, he says, "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God, and if it first begin at us, what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel be?" and so on.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Judgment.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   This is why Peter is exhorting even these believers to be sober, and to gird up the loins of their mind, and to walk in fear.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   These believing people.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Well, as he argues, "If this is true of them, what of the others? If the righteous scarcely be saved, what shall the end of the sinners and the ungodly be? Where shall they appear?"
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Have you ever thought of this, my friend?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know it's because men and women don't face the gospel like this, that they don't believe it.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   They think that this is a matter of opinion. That as you take your opinion of various philosophies, and teachings, and political ideas, and theories, and plans, and proposals,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   so you can sit with your hands in your pockets, as it were, and consider this.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   But you know this is in a category which puts it all together on one side and apart.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   All those other things, they're of interest, they're of importance, I'm not saying a word against them.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   But I am saying this, you know, they're only of interest and of importance. While you and I are in this world, they won't matter at all afterwards.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It doesn't matter whether you belong to the Labour, or the Tory party, or the Liberal party, or the Communist party, when you're on your deathbed.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And when you're dead, it doesn't matter. It's of utter irrelevance.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I don't care what school of philosophy you belong to. When you're buried in your grave, it won't matter.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Are you a realist, an idealist? It doesn't matter. It's of supreme indifference.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And all the excitement about art, and literature, and drama, and all these things, I say these are all right until you live by them.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But if you live by them, you're a fool. They won't matter when you're buried and in the grave, and when you're resurrected, and are in that last judgment and asylum.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   If you call on the Father, who without respect of persons, judges. Judges.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   In other words, the teaching of the Bible is that ultimately God is himself the judge.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "Shall not the judge of all the earth do rights as Abram?" Quite right. But as we read there in the fifth chapter of John's Gospel,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "It has pleased the heavenly and eternal Father to entrust this work of judgment to the Son." It's the same thing.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   The Apostle Paul in preaching at Athens, you remember, makes the same point. He was preaching there to a learned congregation of Stoics and Epicureans.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And having spoken a little bit in general, he comes to his point and says, "But the times of this ignorance God winked at."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "But now calleth all men everywhere to repent." Why? "Well, because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that men whom he hath appointed,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   whereof he hath given notice, in that he hath raised him from the dead."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   The day of judgment. The day of judgment.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   We are moving towards it. It's the last times. It's the end of the age. We are but sojourners here. It will all come to an end.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Whether we are still on earth or not, I don't know. But it will come to an end.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And if we are buried in the grave, we'll be raised, and those who remain will appear before him. And there, there will be a judgment.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   What am I told about this judgment? Well, let me take the apostles' terms again.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The first term he uses is "holy." "Because it is written, 'Be ye holy,' for I am holy."
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   "We shall stand in the presence of God," I say, "in the judgment." Who is God? What's he like? He is holy.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   God is everlastingly the opposite of sin and evil. That's holiness. That's holiness.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   The Father of light. Utter, unimaginable purity, friendliness, brightness, glory.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   "Be ye holy," for I am holy.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Have you ever thought of looking at him? Eternal light. Eternal light.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   How pure the soul must be that placed within thy searching sight.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It shrinks not, but with calm delight can live and look on thee.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Have you ever thought of yourself standing there and looking?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   The angels veil their faces before him. There they are crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts."
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   That's the first thing we are told about this judgment. That is the character of the judge.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Then we are told another thing about him, that his judgment is utterly impartial.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   If he call upon the Father, who, without respect of persons, which means without any partiality,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   without respect of persons. It's important we should realize that, isn't it?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Because we are all such experts at getting favors, aren't we?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And getting round situations. "Ah," says the man, "it's all right, leave it to me, I have an entree."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Respect of persons. "I know so and so who knows somebody else."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And so we get round things. We are wonderful at getting our own ends.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He seems against us, he says, "All right, we'll get round."
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It would be a terrible thing for people who are so clever in that way,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   suddenly to find themselves before one with whom it doesn't work.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Without respect of persons, you can't get round God.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   He's not interested in you and who you are.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   It would be of no advantage to say to God that, "Ah, I lived in Britain, it was a Christian country."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It won't help you.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   "But my father was a godly man, my mother was a saintly woman."
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   It won't help you. You can't bribe God.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Your excuses are of no value. He knows all about you, he knows everything.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And he pays not the slightest notice of all the specious, clever arguments,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   all the rationalizing of our sins, all the explanations that satisfy men.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   No, no, without respect of persons.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It would be a terrible thing, you know, to be naked, as it were,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   to be stripped of every camouflage and pretense and dishonesty and chicanery
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and just stand, knowing that God knows us inside out.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   All things are naked and open to the eye of him with whom we have to do.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Nothing will be hidden or concealed without respect of persons.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Then what else do I read? Well, you noticed the phrase, didn't you?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   "That judgeth according to every man's work."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   You will be judged according to your works, whether good or bad.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   You will be judged according to the deeds that you've done in the body.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Our records are in heaven, your spiritual fingerprints, they're all there.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Your dossier is there and being prepared.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   There's nothing about us but that God knows.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   The books, as I've reminded you, we are told in Revelation 20, will be open.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And there all our deeds and works and actions, there every one of them be open.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "Judgeth every man's works."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And you can't get away from it.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Well now, how are all these things brought together?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   In what light, by what standard are all these works of ours and all we are and have been and haven't been?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   By what standard are all these to be judged?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   It's all right, you see, I believe the record is known that God is everywhere.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   He's omnipresent, he's omniscient.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Well now, but how does that affect me?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Well, it affects you like this, that all this, according to the teaching of this book everywhere,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   will be judged in the light of God's law, that expression of God's holiness.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   You see, we needn't think of God's holiness as something vague.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I know it baffles description when you think of it personally.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   But God has been pleased to give us a revelation of it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   He has been pleased to give a revelation of himself,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and the kind of thing that he demands and expects from us.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   He has given his ten commandments.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   That's an expression of the holiness of God.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He wants his people to live like that, in a life of correspondence with him.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   So we've got it all in the law.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Oh, I must stop again and just put my question,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   you might think that all this is theoretical and that I'm just here stating a case.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   My friend, what I'm anxious to know, what I want to know is this.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   When you consider this gospel, do you consider it in the light of all that?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Is the gospel just something to argue about cleverly,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   and to score your debating bunch, you know, about miracles and Cain's wife and all that sort of thing?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Or do you think of it and argue when you meditate about it, you take it like this?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You say I'm only a sojourner, I'm in a tent.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I may be gone tomorrow, and then I know that finally the end of the age,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and the return, the appearing of Christ, and the judgment, and I shall be there.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   With everybody else.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Tell me, have you ever considered it like this?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   That's how Peter exhorts us to consider it.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   The Bible everywhere does.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   You see, you've got those notable instances in the Old Testament.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Moses in the burning bush, God speaking, God revealing his holiness.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Moses says I will turn aside, I will examine this great sight.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Back comes the voice, stand back, take off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   The ground whereon thou standest is holy ground.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Which being interpreted, I sometimes think means this.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That every time we think about God, or every time we talk about God,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   or discuss our relationship to God, I think you know we ought to be getting down on our knees.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   You can't do it lolling on your back in a club room.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You can't do it while you're drinking or smoking.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   No, no, you can't even do it standing.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   There is only one appropriate attitude.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   We are on holy ground.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   We are facing this holy God.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I say take off your shoes.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   He's told us about himself.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He has given us the revelation of his law.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And we shall be judged in the light of it.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Therefore, I come to the Apostle's next word which is this.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   If ye call on the Father who without respect of persons
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   judgeth according to every man's work past the time of your sojourning here,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   in fear, in fear.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He's writing to Christians, remember.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And he's told them why he tells them to do it in fear.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   He says judgment is to begin at the house of God.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   He says if it begin at us, what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel be?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And if the righteous scarcely with great difficulty be saved,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   past the time of your sojourning in fear.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And if he says that to the Christians, how much more, I say, does he say to those
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   who are not Christians, pass it in fear.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And then you notice he's got another term in verse 18.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Forasmuch, he says, as ye know, that ye were not redeemed.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   We are in a position that we need to be redeemed.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   The very word salvation suggests that already, and we've already considered it.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Well, very well, it's because of this, he says, you should be fearful about this.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And if you've never had a fear of facing God in the judgment,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   it's because you're appallingly ignorant.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   You are eternally blind, as it were.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   But why should I fear, says somebody?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Oh, I'll answer you. I'll give you the biblical answer.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   There is God in his holiness, he's expressed it in the law.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Here am I living in this world, doing things, not doing things.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   My attitude towards God is this and that.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   That's how I've been living. Very well, I stand before him now.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And I'm judged by his holy law, which he has revealed.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   What's my position?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Well, you know the position, don't you?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Do you know that it's a terrible and awful sin
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   to spend a minute of time without praising God?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   They spend the whole of their time in heaven doing that.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Man is meant to do that. May God made man for himself, for his own glory.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   What is the chief end of man? It is to glorify God.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   He made you for that reason, and if you haven't done it, it's the most appalling sin.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Don't talk to me about drunkenness and immorality and vice.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I know they're bad enough, but you know, this is worse.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   This is the essence of sin, not to give God the glory that is his eternity.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Not to live every second that I breathe for his glory and for his namesake.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   That is the law, isn't it?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   That thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And if you don't do it, you've broken the law.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Very well, where do you stand? Let's listen to the Apostle Paul's answer.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   All have sinned, every one of us.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   This is quite apart from the actions that we've done, though we knew that they were wrong.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   This is in spite of all our rebellion and hatred of God and the things we've done deliberately,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   though our conscience warned us and condemned us.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   They all have been done and will arise against us, but this is more important, I say.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   All have sinned, and all have come short of the glory of God.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Jews are condemned, Gentiles are condemned, the whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   That was the tragic mistake of the Jews, as Paul argues in the first three chapters of Romans.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   They thought they were all right. No, no, he says, God hath concluded all under sin.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Everybody, Jew as well as Gentile, none just, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Saul of Tarsus, godly, religious, Hebrew as he was, expert in the law,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   breathing out threatenings and slaughter, chief of sinners.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   to save sinners of whom I am chief.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   The Pharisees fasted twice in the week and gave a tenth of their goods to the poor.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And yet our Lord said, 'Except you have righteousness,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   You won't see it, you're outside it.'
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I say again, if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   That's why you need to fear, my dear friend.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   That's the standard and you haven't kept it, and nobody else has kept it.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Yes, and another reason is this, the punishment that is meted out to those
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   who haven't kept it.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   This is the most alarming thing of all.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Did you notice our Lord's words?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I ask you again, there in that fifth chapter of the gospel, according to St. John,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   he says this, 'Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   they that are in the grave shall hear his voice, and shall come forth,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   they that have done evil, into the resurrection of damnation.'
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Did you hear it in Matthew 25?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Did you hear it when our Lord speaks about Davies and Lazarus?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   About the great gulf that is fixed, and the flame, and the torment,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and the agony, and the impossibility of changing?
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   It's our Lord speaking.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Is it surprising that the apostle exhorts us to pass the time of our
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   sojourning here in fear?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   At that final judgement, when the sentences will be promulgated,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   it will be an eternal sentence in both cases,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   everlasting life and glory,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   or else everlasting destruction,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   and everlasting means everlasting on both sides.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   They're parallels.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   It's the same word.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   You take a bit off one, you take it off the other.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   'Where their worm dieth not,' says our Lord, 'and the fire is not quenched,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   'Oh,' says Peter, 'pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.'
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   My dear friend, is it coming home to you? Do you see it?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   You're only in a tent here, you know.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You're only a visitor, you're only a stranger, you're only a pilgrim.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   You're only moving through this world, you're not going to stay here.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   The end of the ages is coming.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   The Christ will appear and return, and the judgement will be set up,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   and the sentences will be promulgated.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   'Gird up the loins of your mind, I plead with you, I beseech you.'
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   'Think as you've never thought before.'
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   It's like you're saying, you know, 'I think that's all stuff and nonsense,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I don't believe that sort of thing.'
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Do you realise, my dear friend, what you're saying?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Do you realise the context in which you're speaking?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Do you realise the whole situation in which you're involved?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Here it is.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   But, sir, somebody, I don't believe in that.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   People no longer believe in that old doctrine of yours.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   It would have been all right a hundred years ago.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   But now we know that God is a God of love.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Well, my dear friend, you're not arguing with me, you're arguing with the Bible.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And what I find in the Bible is this,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   that God made man perfect and put him in paradise.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   He told him that if he disobeyed, he'd be driven out of paradise.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Man did disobey,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   and he was driven out of paradise.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   What God said, God did.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   He drove him out,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   and he put the cherubim in the flaming sword to prevent his return,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   and he never got back into it.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   God said he'd do that. God has done that.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   I find it everywhere in the Old Testament.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   The children of Israel were God's own chosen people.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   He'd made them for himself. He delighted in them.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   And yet, you see, when they disobeyed, you notice what he does with them?
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He said he'd punish them. He did punish them.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   They were conquered by the Chaldeans
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and carried down into the captivity of Babylon.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   You know, God seems to have certain favourites amongst men, doesn't he?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Look at a man like David the king.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And yet, when David the king committed that foul sin,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   he had to suffer for it.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   God said that he is righteous, and God has proved that he is righteous
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   in the way he handles his own chosen people
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and in his brightest saints when they fall into sin.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   God doesn't merely threaten. God carries out his threat invariably.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Otherwise, his word would not be of any value.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   The teaching is here everywhere in the Psalms.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   It's here everywhere in the Prophets.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Do you remember the message of John the Baptist?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   "Who hath mourned you? He says to flee from the wrath to come."
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Repent!
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   It's not only in the preaching of John the Baptist.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   It's in the preaching of the apostle Peter.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Listen to him filled with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   This is what he cries out saying,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   "Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Here he is saying it again in this epistle.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Listen to the apostle Paul saying it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I have already quoted him in Athens.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Listen to him writing to the Thessalonians in the first epistle,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   first chapter, verse ten.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   He talks about Christ. What has he come to do?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   He has come, he says, to save us from the wrath to come.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It is everywhere in the teaching of all these apostles,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   all the New Testament writers.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Go to your last book in the Bible,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   the book of Revelation. What's it about?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   It's about this, the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   It is the apocalypse.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   It is a description of this and a warning,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   urging people to fear and to be ready for its coming.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   But above all I say you get it in the teaching of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   How mad men are to talk about their knowledge of the love of God.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Here is the full expression of God's love.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Here is the Son who has come out of the eternal bosom.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Here is love itself incarnate.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And yet it is he who warns us.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   It is he who tells us
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   about the great and the eternal gulf that is fixed between heaven and hell.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   I can do no more, my friends, than leave these words with you.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ said the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   The Son of Man, he says, is come not to be ministered unto,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Why? Well, because it's the only way to save them from this wrath which is to come.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And if you really want to know something about this judgment and its terms,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   you've got to go and look at that cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Why did the Son of God die?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Because God is just.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And this just and holy God can only justify a sinner.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   By means of what he has done to his own Son,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   he has set him forth as a propitiation.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Why? That he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   There above everywhere we see the justice, the righteousness, the holiness, the wrath of God.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   It's as much a fact as this, that God smote his own Son.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   He would never have done that unless it was absolutely essential.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   It is on the cross on Calvary's hill above everywhere else in the universe
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   that we see the truth of the statement that the wrath of God from heaven
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   has been already revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   It is there.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   What can I more say?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Oh, all I want to do with you and to beg of you is this,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   that as you think and meditate about the words that I've been speaking this evening,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   you shouldn't do so in an armchair.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   You should get down on your knees.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   You should say, "I can't afford to be lighthearted and clever about this.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   I'm only an attempt. I'm only a sojourner. I'm a traveller. I'm moving.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   I see that death isn't the end. I've been rather banking on that.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   I go out of it and I've finished with it, but I haven't."
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Resurrection! Christ has risen because he has.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   We're all, everybody's going to rise. He said so himself.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   And he proves he's the Son of God by his resurrection.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   He said that all that are in the grave shall rise. I'll be amongst them.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Am I ready for that?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Can I look into the face of God without shriveling and shrinking to all eternity?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   That's all I ask you.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Just remember that you're a sojourner, a journeyman, a traveller, a stranger, a pilgrim.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   One's moving. One who's involved in it all and will be gone quite soon.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   And yet a pilgrim of eternity who will stand in the presence of God.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Why should you listen to this message?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Why should you gird up the lines of your mind? I'll tell you.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   There is only one way of safety, one way of deliverance,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   one way of passing, even in this world, from judgment to life.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   It is to believe this message that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   and that he came into this world to save us from the wrath of God against him.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   That he did so by burying that wrath himself in his own body on the tree.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   He took your punishment and mine.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   And it is for that reason that God can forgive us freely.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   That's why you must listen to it. It's the only hope.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   The alternative is everlasting death and destruction
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   outside the presence and the glory of God and the joy of heaven.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   In the name of God I beseech you, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   It took the death of the Son of God to save a single soul.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   If you're not in him, you see what remains to you.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Remember the end of the age, the end of time, the end of history.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   That is coming. That may be very near.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Remember that you are involved in it.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
