[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.240]   No, not yet man.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240]   We're working on it.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   Trust me.

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.600]   Was that one of your design requirements for the van?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080]   It had to have a podcast studio?
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   Like here's what I'm looking for.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.560]   I'm looking for like a stove, a sink, a bathroom, a bed, and a podcast studio.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   One of the like soundproof walls and everything else.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   Well, cool man.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   Cool.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   I, man, I'm so excited for you guys to get that thing going and, or I mean it's, it's
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   going, but for you guys to, to get into it, just looking forward to seeing how this plays
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   out, man.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.200]   It's super exciting.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840]   Super exciting deal.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.200]   Anything else going on with you, man?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Anything new?
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   No, that's about it.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.120]   Just, just me and Cameron trying to, trying to push forward and get ourselves out there.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   Start seeing this beautiful nation that we have, man.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.280]   So anybody wants to add suggestions to our site, they're more welcome.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   That's up and running.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.200]   So we're, we're taking suggestions and plotting them on the map for our to-do list and getting
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.920]   ready to start planning those trips.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.880]   So yeah, I've, I've added a few and to be honest, man, I kind of had to stop myself
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.440]   cause I'm like, man, I've, I could add like probably two in every state, but I don't
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.640]   know if they're looking for that much, looking for that much stuff or not, but I might be
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.240]   back in there at some point.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   I love it.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   All right, man.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.440]   So I don't really have too much of an intro topic this week.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   One thing I did want to maybe talk about a little bit was a pretty cool little guide
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.800]   I found for motherboard.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.520]   And do you, do you remember that?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   I'm sorry, man.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.440]   Do you remember the name of that right off the top of your head?
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.920]   Cause I've actually lost my link here for it.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   It's a little guide.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.440]   It's the motherboard guide to not getting hacked.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.000]   And they basically do quick, short little guide and some pretty good beginner guide,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   if you will.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.920]   As far as doing quick privacy and security for you.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.160]   Yeah, honestly, man, for what it is, I thought it was, I thought it was pretty darn good.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.080]   I ran across this on Reddit yesterday and this thing has been out for, for a couple
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   of weeks now.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   It's not brand new, but man, this thing goes through a lot of stuff.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.480]   A lot of like, it opens up a threat modeling.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.200]   It talks about like a lot of the stuff we talk about, like using a good passwords and
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   password managers and keeping your apps up to date and a two factor authentication.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   And I'm just kind of scrolling down the list here and maybe it's not quite the order that
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.000]   I would put it in, but overall, man, I felt like this was, I felt like this was a pretty
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.320]   good place to start.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.240]   I like right in the beginning, like, well, sorry, right in the meat and potatoes of it,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.280]   they have like a quick like do's and don'ts, which is really nice.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   And then as well, I thought it was pretty interesting when it, when I got into mobile
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.920]   security, it's, they're just simple, get an iPhone.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.840]   They do a whole little excerpt and it's like, but I love Android.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   Fine.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   Here you go.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   So, um, they, they, they are very, uh, uh, very dedicated to signal on this for some
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   reason, which, which, which is fine, which is fine.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   I would like to see, um, you know, wires and option there because they do like very clearly
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.160]   acknowledge the like difficulty of setting up signal, uh, with either your real phone
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.480]   number and having to give your real phone number out or a fake phone number.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.160]   And then having to like, you know, all your contacts don't know that's you.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.680]   So having to get with them individually offline and give them your signal number and, and
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   all that stuff.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.120]   So, um, they, they do acknowledge that.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.840]   And I, you know, this isn't exactly what I would write, but man, probably, probably nothing
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   is probably nobody's going to agree a hundred percent with me.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.560]   And, uh, this was, I don't know, man, this was just refreshing to see kind of an all
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   in one guide.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.520]   It even got into a few things that I thought were kind of, you know, maybe a little bit
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.100]   more tinfoil hat than you would expect on, you know, on your average, like mainstream
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.100]   privacy guide.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.880]   And I, they get into like tour and everything else.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.520]   And even, you know, one of the things I liked as I talked about device cameras and microphones,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.280]   you know, like kind of going in depth on that.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.740]   And, you know, if you want to, you can throw them in the microwave if you're really concerned
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.760]   about what apps and things like that as far as people are recording you and things.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   So they do get a little tinfoil hat, which is kind of cool, but not like too crazy, I
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   don't think.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.240]   And I kind of wish they offered some, uh, you know, maybe some middle of the road solutions.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.320]   Like, you know, they, they have a section on credit cards that, uh, and now this is
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.600]   just turning into you and me picking apart this like totally well-intentioned, uh, overall,
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   very good thing.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.640]   But, uh, you know, they're like for credit cards, they're like, don't use your credit
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.280]   cards because credit card companies, you know, give that information over to the government
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.320]   and, and that's fine.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   I don't disagree.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.560]   Uh, but their only alternative is Bitcoin.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.400]   And uh, you know, I, I like, I would kind of like to see something like, you know, like
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.200]   some of the other options we use, uh, privacy or pseudo pay or, or blur or whatever in there
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   for those middle of the road circumstances.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.960]   I don't, you know, um, I don't feel like I need to use Bitcoin on every single purchase
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.960]   I make.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.360]   I don't feel like I need every single thing I buy to be 100% anonymous, but I also don't
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.000]   want to give out my credit card number really for anything.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.600]   It would have been nice to, especially now with all the different options, privacy and
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.520]   blur and pseudo, like you said.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.040]   But I will say above all, man, they did talk about encryption, full disencrypting your
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   hard drive.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.200]   Yeah, they definitely did.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   They definitely did.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   So, uh, I'll make sure that we have a link for that in the show notes.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.320]   And uh, if, if maybe there's someone in your life that's looking for like a really easy
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.240]   beginner guide, uh, maybe that's a good place to send them.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.640]   I, you know, I know I, uh, well actually Jesse's probably my biggest champion as far as the
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.360]   30 day security challenge.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.440]   I know I send a lot of people to that man, but, uh, maybe not everyone responds to, to
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.460]   like that 30 day style and they want to read a full article like this, or maybe not everyone
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.960]   likes my writing style or whatever.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.520]   So, um, there, there's a bunch of alternatives out there and overall I think this is a really
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   good one.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   I don't think they went too deep in the weeds on the technical side and kept it pretty,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.800]   you know, um, I don't want to say lame and make people sound like they're dumb, but it
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   does keep it very simple, um, and kind of straight to the point, which is kind of nice.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.800]   So, uh, do you want to talk a little bit about what we're going to do in the main topic today?
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Um, yeah, man, you know, actually you're, you're just talking about them and the, uh,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   the credit cards and anonymous payments and stuff.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.160]   We're actually gonna do a show on personal finance.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.240]   Um, and you know, this week's guest is Joshua Sheets from the Radical Personal Finance
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   Podcast.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.440]   We're going to bring him on and get some questions and kind of do some interviewing with him.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.640]   And, uh, you know, like it's, it's not a joke.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.600]   Uh, it's, it's not just slick marketing.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   The Radical Personal Finance Podcast, uh, really is radical.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.720]   He has, uh, he's had me on to, uh, and, and basically let me go as far as I want on the
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.080]   privacy stuff.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.560]   He, he has, uh, just a lot of interesting guests on and kind of some radical lifestyle
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   suggestions.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.120]   Actually, Jesse, he just did an episode a few weeks ago about, uh, living in your vehicle
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.080]   and he, you know, he doesn't recommend that for everybody, but he's like, man, if you're,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.200]   if you're in a situation where you could, uh, you know, you could buy a vehicle with
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.400]   a camper or, uh, you know, buy a van or whatever, you could save a ton of money.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.560]   Um, he, he's not your traditional financial advisor and I, I absolutely love his show.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.320]   And if you're kind of new to the world of financial advice, um, he has a very approachable,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.480]   uh, manner to him and a very, just a very entertaining show if nothing else.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.120]   So, uh, I'll quit rambling on about him.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   We'll go ahead and get him on here.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.400]   Joshua, welcome to the Complete Privacy and Security Podcast.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   Thank you for having me.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.800]   Hey Josh, uh, welcome to the show.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.960]   Um, would you mind starting out by telling our audiences a little bit about yourself
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.120]   and your experiences in the, uh, financial planning?
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.120]   Sure.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   You know, I was always, uh, interested from an early age in the world of money.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.360]   I was the nerd who in high school when most people were probably out playing football,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.520]   I'd be sitting around reading books on money.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.560]   And so I was a personal finance aficionado from an early age.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.600]   Uh, in 2008 that led to my deciding after I got laid off from a job, I decided to go
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.320]   into the actual financial planning business.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.240]   And so I began my career in the actual world of professional financial planning in about
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   2008.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.600]   And I worked as a financial advisor for a total of just under six years.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   And during that time, I worked really hard to learn the world of professional finance.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.920]   I became a pretty highly credentialed advisor.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.120]   I have a master's degree in financial planning, uh, was a certified financial planner and
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.680]   a chartered life underwriter, a chartered financial consultant, and a half other, maybe
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.560]   a handful of other industry designations.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.900]   So I worked really hard on the academic side of professional financial planning.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:20.200]   And then in about 2013, I looked around and I became frustrated with the world of, uh,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.560]   what I saw as consumer level, uh, personal finance advice.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   It seemed like there was a really great wealth of information related to somebody at the
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.160]   basic level of personal finance advice.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.840]   Here's how you can get out of debt or here's how you can get a better deal on your cell
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.440]   phone, et cetera.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.760]   But I was exposed to the world of professional financial planning.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.100]   Here's how you put together a guaranteed, uh, you know, a grant for your estate planning
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.920]   in order to help this or, or a charitable remainder trust and all this kind of hardcore
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.320]   financial planning stuff.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.880]   Uh, but that, and that was well represented in the world of professional financial advice,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.000]   but I didn't see anything that kind of crossed that gap that brought the world of professional
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.920]   financial planning techniques to the world of personal finance.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.540]   And a lot of the debates and, uh, arguments that occurred in the personal finance online
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.560]   blogosphere podcast world, I just felt they missed the mark.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.760]   So looking at the beautiful new world of niche internet content, I decided to throw my hat
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.800]   in the ring and see if I can do something better.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.040]   So about three and a half years ago, I shuttered my financial planning business, surrendered
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.080]   all my licenses and designations and launched a show called radical personal finance.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.140]   And it's a 100% a podcast focused on audio, uh, information.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.300]   And what I've sought to do is a tagline of the show is to help people to live a rich
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.160]   life now while also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   And I've tried to bring together the inspirational and philosophical ideas that make a difference,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.880]   mix them with the practical tactics that are accessible to everyone, and then sprinkle
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.280]   that all over with a framework of hardcore financial planning so that we can do things
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.480]   in a very efficient way.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   Uh, so now it's been about three and a half to four years building radical personal finance,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.680]   just published the 500th episode and going strong and have no plans to stop.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.160]   Now, Joshua, Jesse and I were talking about this a little bit before the show, and I was
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.960]   attempting to explain to him why your show is truly radical and why that isn't just some
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.580]   slick marketing.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.360]   Can you talk about that just a little bit?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.640]   Well, I try to not have any fear about tackling subjects that are abnormal.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.800]   Now, I still have the fear because it's amazing how strong the cultural influences are when
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   you have a certain position to kind of say, you shouldn't do this.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.000]   But I try to, if I feel uncomfortable about a subject or I feel like, oh, I wonder how
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.360]   I'm going to be perceived about this, I try to suppress that and press on.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.740]   So those are a few examples.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.040]   Number one, I try to talk about things that are accessible to many people.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.320]   So I've done shows on dumpster diving and I've done shows on how to live in your car
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.920]   and just kind of weird off topic things like that that are not normal for somebody who's
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.720]   a credentialed financial advisor.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.280]   I also try to tackle the hardcore philosophical ideas and I try to treat them radically.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.040]   So I've interviewed people who are tax protesters who refuse to pay income taxes because of
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.760]   their disagreement with how the US government uses that money.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.160]   I've spoken with and interviewed people who are expatriates who teach people how to spread
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.800]   their assets all around the world in order to provide for themselves.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.760]   I also try to talk about some of the more aggressive approaches to financial independence.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.520]   I keep my foot planted firmly in the world of what's called the financial independence
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:39.480]   early retirement movement, which is all about groups of people who are seeking to retire
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.320]   not at the age of 65, but in five years or 10 years or 15 years of active working.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.440]   And it's a very doable process and so I try to teach those techniques.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.560]   And then I also cover topics that I think are really interesting.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:59.960]   So here's how you can set up your house with a half acre urban lot or a quarter acre urban
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   lot.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.720]   Here's how you can turn it into a productive micro farm and set up a sideline business
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.040]   selling micro greens to local restaurants and make yourself a very handsome five figure
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.280]   annual profit from that little business that turns your home into a productive source of
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   capital.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.160]   Or let's talk about how maybe instead of putting more money in your 401k, you should put more
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.260]   money into insulating your old house.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.160]   So it's a little bit more energy efficient and that may have a better payoff.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.040]   So I try to approach these things with the academic rigor of financial planning, but
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.520]   also to focus on strategies that are really applicable to many people.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   And I've also observed, I'm probably a bit of a maverick in the world of professional
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.040]   financial advice because I've observed that a lot of what we as financial advisors commonly
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:53.120]   discuss can work technically, but it often doesn't work because people don't do it.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.620]   And I noticed that as a financial advisor, we in the professional financial advice industry
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.820]   were, and to be clear, I'm no longer a financial advisor.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.080]   So when I was one, I noticed that we in the financial advice industry were very good at
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.160]   helping people who are already rich to care for their money, but we weren't very good
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.800]   at helping people become rich.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   And so I've tried to tackle these subjects without fear of ideology or dogma, but rather
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.720]   in discuss them in a straightforward way that in my mind, the common person could really
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.080]   understand and find some ideas that they could implement.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.120]   Yeah, that's one thing I really appreciate about your show.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.880]   And I could probably spend the next allotment of our time for this interview talking about
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.400]   favorite episodes of yours.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:45.520]   But one thing that you do that I feel like basically people who are super focused in
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.120]   one field or another in all fields do, and we're certainly guilty of this in privacy,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.360]   is to kind of miss the forest for the trees.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.400]   You recently had a listener call in and say, "Hey, here's my income.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.160]   Here's my assets.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.960]   And you know, my girlfriend, I want to propose to my girlfriend.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.920]   So what should I invest in first?"
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.200]   And you're like, "Whoa, whoa, you just skipped over the biggest part of that."
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.760]   If the time is right in your life to get married and to take the step that's going to make
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.880]   you happy, that should be your priority.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.680]   And I think it's easy for people that are focused on one particular aspect, like finance
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.760]   or whatever it may be, to focus on that and to the exclusion of everything else.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.400]   That's one thing I really enjoy about your show.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.800]   And I just wanted to point that out because the way you answered that question was particularly
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.440]   meaningful to me.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:44.520]   But anyway, moving on to this, let's tie this into privacy and talk about why you're on
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.640]   a privacy and security show.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.760]   Can you tell us why being financially stable or financially secure, I'm not sure what your
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.840]   taxonomy is with that, but why is that important to maintaining personal privacy?
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.640]   I think a number of different areas.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.800]   There are a lot of ways that we could talk about that.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.560]   First and foremost, if you don't have some degree of financial stability, I think, frankly,
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.960]   any of the, let's just call them intermediate actions that can help to maintain financial
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.560]   privacy are going to be out of your reach.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.920]   But also, they're going to be probably just not even worth pursuing.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.120]   For example, if you want to use a post office box as your way of receiving physical mail,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   that's going to cost extra.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.400]   You have a perfectly good mailbox out in front of your house or down in the lobby of your
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.640]   apartment building.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.800]   If you want to build a, but if you want to use a payo box, that's going to cost you extra
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   per year.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.200]   So you need to have that set up and be in a situation where you're able to do it.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.320]   When you start to get to more advanced financial privacy techniques, you're going to wind up
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   spending more money for many of the things that you do.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:03.080]   For example, let's say that you want to shelter and to title some of your assets outside of
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.120]   your personal name, which is more easily searchable by somebody who's trying to find out information
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.960]   about your personal finances.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.520]   And you want to title them within the context of an entity of some kind.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.640]   Well, that entity is going to cost money.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.000]   It's going to cost money for the formation of the entity.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.600]   It's going to cost money for the maintenance of the entity, for all of the appropriate
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.780]   agents that service that entity.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:32.640]   So if you don't have some basic level of financial stability in your life, that's going to be
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.800]   really hard for you to pursue long term.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.480]   That said, I think it's not as-- there is, as with most things, some really low-hanging
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   fruit.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.460]   And I, as you say about missing the forest for the trees with the example that you gave,
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.960]   in many ways, we do that with a lot of subjects.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   And that particular approach to financial planning is especially important to me, to
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.840]   always focus on what's the most important at this phase of time.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.640]   Let me give one more example and then swing back to privacy.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.520]   I learned when I was a financial advisor, when I was selling financial products, that
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:14.120]   it was in my own financial interest to focus my conversation on specific areas of discussion
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.600]   that would result in my ability to potentially sell a product.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.060]   And this is the great downfall and the great challenge of the world of financial advice.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.840]   It may be all well and good for me to encourage somebody to pay off their debt.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.320]   And I spent many hours talking to prospective clients about paying off their debt.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.880]   But it's hard for me to figure out how to get those clients to pay me any money to give
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.280]   them that advice.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.680]   And so if you think, however, about what's going to make a bigger difference, somebody
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.600]   putting an extra $1,000 in their 401(k) or paying off their debt, probably, lifestyle-wise,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.720]   paying off their debt is going to be a big thing.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.160]   Or another example would be where they live and what they do for work.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:56.080]   If you were to look at the amount of satisfaction and health and stability and well-being, the
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.920]   actual structure of your life that you get from being in a situation where you have extra
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.720]   savings, and you were to compare that to just simply living in a place that you chose because
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.440]   you want to live there, working with people that you like, and having personal people
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.200]   in your life that you like and that you enjoy being around, it's going to be a far bigger
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.520]   benefit for you, lifestyle-wise, to live and work where you want to, rather than to have
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.800]   an extra $10,000 in your 401(k).
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.560]   So I've given the advice to lots of people.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:30.280]   Why don't you stop putting money in your 401(k) and save up $10,000 so you can afford
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.760]   to move across the country?
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.340]   And instead of living in some big, giant city, why don't you move to a ski town in the Rocky
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.560]   Mountains or move to the beach?
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.000]   They've got jobs everywhere.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.280]   You don't have to be rich to make this lifestyle change.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.100]   You just need to actually intentionally focus it.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.200]   So in the same way, I think that applies in the world of professional financial advice.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.640]   People miss the fact that you want to focus on those things that are going to give you
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.560]   the most return first, which is something like having a job that's well-suited for you.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.720]   In the world of privacy, I think the same thing applies, however, because in the same
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.680]   way that switching to a different job will buy you much more life happiness, something
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.880]   like minimizing the amount of information that you publish about yourself is going to
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.520]   be a big impact on your personal privacy.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.400]   So it doesn't cost a lot of money to start pulling back the constant leakage of personal
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.500]   information that we all put out into the world of social media.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.840]   That doesn't cost anything.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.760]   You don't cost much to be a little bit more circumspect with all the details and the data
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.800]   of your life that you share with others.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.360]   So it's a real balance.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.280]   And I think that it's important to recognize that you don't have to be rich.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   You don't have to even be financially stable to start being more careful with the leakage
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.080]   from your life of all of your personal information.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   But if you want to start to pursue some of the more aggressive medium stage and, as you
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.240]   put it in your book, expert stage strategies, you better be prepared to pay because they
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.360]   are certainly going to cost you more.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.240]   That's an interesting, I love your perspective on that.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.640]   A lot of your financial advisors, they will tell you 401(k), Roth IRAs, everything's for
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   the future.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:19.600]   And that whole plan of retirement at that 60-65 age range, you bring up an interesting
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.240]   perspective of, hey, instead of putting that $10,000 in a 401(k), use it to move somewhere
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.720]   else that you enjoy and stuff like that.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.880]   So I guess that being said, can you describe what you would consider "to be financially
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.560]   stable or financially secure"?
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   I think it's really a continuum.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.520]   And we really do need to understand where somebody is starting from.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.000]   And I'll give you the stages that I look at and that I have mapped out that I teach.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.860]   They're on my website at RadicalPersonalFinance.com, and I've covered them in the show.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:53.820]   But the basic stages that I see to go from zero to what I call financial abundance work
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.200]   like this.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.280]   Stage zero is a place of financial dependence.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.160]   And that's where we all start.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   We all begin from a place of being dependent on others for our livelihood.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.800]   I have young children.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.620]   They're fully dependent on me.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.000]   And so every one of us began in that place.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.360]   And that may be a place of a young person, a young adult who is currently dependent on
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.300]   the financial support of their parents.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.680]   Or it may be an adult who has hit a rough patch in life, and they've needed the help
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.760]   and care of other people in order to continue forward.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.820]   They needed to depend on personal charity.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.020]   They needed to depend on some form of governmental program.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.500]   That's a stage of financial dependence.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.080]   So the first goal is to move from financial dependence to stage one of financial independence
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.920]   called financial solvency.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:51.280]   And I define solvency as being able to support yourself on your own income without the aid
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.880]   of others and being current on all of your bills.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.520]   So being able to support yourself on your own income without financial support from
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.660]   others and being current on all of your bills.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.900]   If you can't be financially solvent or if you're not financially solvent, it's very
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.040]   hard to do anything in life.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   It's really tough.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:14.380]   I've worked with a lot of people who are insolvent, and it's the lion at the door.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.240]   You can't do much until you're in that place.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.760]   But once you can get financially solvent, then we can move on and start to build layers
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   of independence and stability.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.240]   So stage one, financial solvency.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.120]   Stage two, financial stability is what I've called it.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.340]   That means that once you're current on your bills, you need to build some sort of buffer
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.900]   account and call it an emergency fund, a rainy day fund, cash reserves, just some kind of
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.660]   money that will start to protect you from the unexpected.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.100]   Because no matter what, unexpected problems are already always going to happen.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.280]   Something will break, something will come up.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.140]   Or on the flip side, unexpected opportunities will come up, and you need to have money available
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.140]   to you.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.800]   I don't have any hard and fast numbers on this, but I've actually learned over the years,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.840]   the hard way, not to encourage people to focus first and foremost on the big picture financial
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.420]   tools that many people focus on.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.380]   For example, putting money in an IRA.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.520]   That's fine, but that's not the first step.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.900]   And so in this stage of financial stability, building up an emergency fund, I think it's
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.740]   good to go based upon either a few months of expenses, three to six months is ideal.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.820]   I encourage young people that their first major financial goal should be to build up
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.980]   a reserve account of about 10,000 bucks that's available to them.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.220]   Whether that's in a savings account, physical currency that's available to them, about 10,000
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.220]   bucks.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.460]   Because if you think about the life change of the average young man or woman, and how
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.860]   impactful $10,000 is, it opens up the world of options.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.100]   There's almost nothing you can't do if you have $10,000.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.020]   In the United States, about half the population can't lay their hands on, I forget, is it
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.540]   500 or $1,000 cash if they needed to without borrowing it.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:01.020]   So the majority of families, if they just put themselves in a situation where they had
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.540]   about $10,000 saved up, would move themselves from the bottom 50% of society to the top
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.100]   50% of society.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:14.700]   And they would be well cushioned against the vast majority of life problems that come at
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   them.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.860]   So that's stage two, financial stability.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.220]   Stage three that I teach is debt freedom.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.860]   This one is hard to know where to put, but generally if you have debt, for most people,
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.380]   you're going to want to get rid of it.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.140]   Now obviously not all debt is created equal, so you need to sit down and look carefully
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.280]   at the debt.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.620]   But definitely you want to be rid of any high interest rate debt.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.280]   Definitely you need to have any old unpaid debts cleared off.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.600]   Definitely you probably want to clear any consumer debt, especially consumer debt that's
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.900]   tied to depreciating assets.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:48.080]   And if you do have any debts on investment assets, like investment real estate or productive
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.520]   business assets, generally you want to make a plan to clear that debt as well.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.900]   Because no matter who you are and what stage you are, if you are fully debt free, you will
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.860]   simply enjoy greater freedom and independence in your life.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.740]   And that's one of the things that most of us are looking for with regard to money.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.260]   And then quickly stage four is financial security.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:15.500]   What I teach is that from now on, you're trying to build up streams of income from investment
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.640]   portfolios, from independent businesses, from savings that will provide for an increasing
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.320]   percentage of your lifestyle.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.300]   So I have stage four, financial security, which is a first stage to have your basic
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.020]   living expenses covered by your investment income.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.060]   I define that as housing expenses, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, just those
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.460]   basic things.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.220]   Stage five I call financial independence, which means that your current lifestyle expenses,
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.260]   both needs and wants, but your current lifestyle expenses can be reached and covered by your
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.220]   independent investment income.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.940]   Stage six I call financial freedom, which is where you've attained any kind of additional
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.720]   lifestyle goals that you would like to have.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.900]   More toys you'd like to have, things you want to buy or experiences that cost more money.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.540]   You want to clarify those and then plan to cover those with investment income.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.620]   And I consider that to be a place of true financial freedom.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.460]   And then move on to stage seven, which I call financial abundance, which means that you've
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.200]   accumulated wealth that's beyond the amount that you need to fund your own lifestyle expenses.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.420]   Then you have a comfortable margin of safety.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.140]   And so this is the stage that most wealthy people get to.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.300]   And this is the stage where I think you can consider somebody wealthy in the fullest sense
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   of the word.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.220]   And you have to decide, how do I responsibly manage this surplus?
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.900]   Who's it going to go to when I'm done with it?
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.820]   And how do I control it?
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.420]   And this is where you start to face the really hard problems, which is, what do I want my
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   money to mean?
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.420]   I've got way more money than I need for myself.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.660]   So now what change in the world am I going to accomplish with the money?
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.960]   So I look at it as a phased approach.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.160]   But I think if you're looking for metrics-- and I have no way to define those exactly.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.560]   But in metrics, I'm convinced of two things.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.480]   Number one, $10,000 in the bank moves almost anybody from the bottom of society to the
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   very top.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.320]   I'm going to guess top 20%, although I haven't verified those numbers.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.120]   I would guess that having $10,000 of liquid cash available to you moves you to the top
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   20%.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.360]   And it opens up almost any life decision that you want.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.760]   And the second one that I encourage people to shoot for, $100,000-- $100,000 available
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.680]   to you, not locked away in an account you can't touch, not locked up in an investment
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   asset.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.120]   But $100,000 that's liquid and available to you really puts you in a position where there's
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.880]   no business you can't start.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.820]   There's no interest that you can't pursue.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.160]   There's no place you can't move.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.420]   There's no life decision that you can't make.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.160]   You have a huge amount of financial independence.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.200]   You're not yet independent from your need to work for a living.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.320]   But all of your decisions are open to you.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.540]   And when you reckon with the reality that most people will never want to not work in
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:02.240]   some form or fashion, we start to see that this financial independence can be achieved
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.040]   much more quickly than most people have thought possible.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.640]   No, you don't need to have $4 million in your 401(k) to feel like you're doing OK with money.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.120]   You probably need $10,000 to $100,000 available to you so that you can make those life decisions.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.440]   That will put you in the place to enjoy the next 30 years while you're building and saving
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.640]   the money in your 401(k) to get to your $4 million number.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.340]   I really like that context of this giving you options and this giving you the ability
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.300]   to pursue whatever it is you want to pursue.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:35.360]   We always get to this point when we start talking about certain privacy things, especially
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.840]   at that expert level where it's like this option is not going to be available to every
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   person.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.600]   This option is not something that we recommend that everyone pursue.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:53.480]   And only now do I realize that when I came on your show, I didn't quite have this context
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.420]   and didn't quite have my head around this, but if you have $100,000 in the bank, pretty
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.320]   much anything we talk about is available to you if you want to pursue it and pretty much
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.760]   anything else that you want to pursue.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:10.640]   I really appreciate you putting in that context.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:17.000]   So when building wealth, when accumulating money, or just doing your taxes, this is a
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.520]   thing that I'm actually up against right now because my accountant retired earlier this
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:29.160]   year and you've done an episode called "Don't Trust Your Financial Planner" or "Don't Trust
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:36.600]   Your Accountant" that aired shortly before the time I came on your show.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.560]   And it was about how insecure those services are even though they're managing our money.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.800]   What recommendations do you have on finding an accountant, a financial planner, a tax
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.780]   preparer, anyone who deals with your finances that respects your privacy and uses some security
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.960]   best practices?
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.640]   That is a hard one.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.200]   That is a real hard one.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.600]   So to answer the question directly, I only have essentially one or two suggestions on
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.960]   how to find one, but I have a bunch of suggestions on how to create one out of the one you currently
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   have.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.120]   So first and foremost, the biggest thing that I think many people have a misconception over
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.480]   is that they can maintain their financial privacy while also disclosing their ideas
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.260]   and their information to a financial professional.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.000]   Many people have the idea that, "Well, I can go ahead and tell my financial advisor, tell
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.960]   my accountant about all my money.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.120]   I can tell my accountant," as an example, let's talk about somebody who's committing
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   tax fraud.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.880]   "I can tell my accountant that, well, I had an extra $50,000 on the side that I earned
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.960]   that I'm not reporting to you, but here, just let me report this $50,000 that I do want
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   to report."
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.720]   Well, the accountant may or may not move forward with you depending on that information, but
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:55.880]   the accountant can, when they're interviewed by the IRS agent, it brings them into court
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.360]   and subpoenas them, the accountant is going to be required to report on the record what
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.800]   you said to them about the fact that you made an extra $50,000 on the side that you're not
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.440]   reporting to the accountant.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:12.040]   Number two, the accountant's files can all be requested and submitted to the court.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.160]   And this is the same with any kind of financial professional that you work with as a financial
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.720]   advisor.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.600]   When I did work as a financial advisor, I had lots of people told me all the intimate
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.040]   details of their financial life.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.520]   I had lots of people who would share with me, as they probably needed to, all of their
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   account statements.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.360]   They had detailed records on everything that they had.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.800]   Now, pretend for a moment that I had a client that sat down with me, gave me all of the
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.520]   information about their whole financial picture.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.600]   And then two years later, this client starts to go through a divorce.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.320]   And in those divorce proceedings, they don't fully disclose all of their assets and all
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.080]   of the financial information to their spouse's attorney.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.760]   Well, that spouse's attorney can subpoena me and can subpoena my files.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   And if those files are demonstrating a different story than that person is telling their divorce
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.120]   attorney or is telling the other divorce attorney, they're going to have a problem.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.640]   So it's important to always recognize that, first and foremost, your financial relationships
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:17.040]   with people who are your financial service people are not fully private or secure.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.960]   And I think that it's important for people to recognize that.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.640]   Now, so specific suggestion, about the only specific suggestion that I could give would
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:32.240]   be if you have the opportunity to work with somebody in an attorney relationship, that
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.720]   may possibly provide you with a little bit of protection for something like I've described
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.120]   because attorneys do indeed enjoy attorney-client privilege.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.680]   There are not many attorneys, and especially the practicing attorneys, practicing in the
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.240]   world of financial advice.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.360]   So that one's harder.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:55.240]   But in the world of tax preparation, there is a small organization of accountants who
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.140]   are licensed both as CPAs and as attorneys.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.300]   And so you might consider, if privacy is important to you, you might consider pursuing somebody
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.500]   who has that dual structure.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.560]   And you might consider working with somebody who can work with you in an attorney-client
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:15.420]   relationship, especially if you have a troublesome financial problem, so that you can enjoy that
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.160]   attorney-client privilege.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.080]   Beyond that, the only way that you can really approach it is to be careful about the person
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.600]   that you work with.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.320]   Try to find somebody who will honor your privacy.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   And I don't know how to do this, other than to say you've got to watch your gut.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:38.400]   To toot my own horn, I always tried really, really hard to protect fully my client's privacy
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   when I was an advisor.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   I tried very hard to never talk about anybody.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:48.920]   I would never say even if someone was a client or not, because I think that's really important.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.640]   But my observation has been that there's a wide range of people's commitment to privacy.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.500]   And at every company, at every firm, there is a proverbial water cooler.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.960]   And especially if you are somebody with a high profile, there's a good chance that your
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.000]   information may be discussed, which is why I think it's very important to shop and to
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.200]   consider somebody who's going to be circumspect.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.040]   If you're a celebrity, if you're somebody who has a high profile and you're sharing
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.760]   all of your information with somebody, that person may respect it to a degree, but they
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.720]   can also open their mouth and start to share some things.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.280]   So you have to judge the character of the person.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.640]   And then the only way I know to really handle it is to compartmentalize, to compartmentalize
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.480]   the information that you share with somebody.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:39.160]   And this is hard, because the best advisors are going to want and to frankly need the
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.360]   most complete information.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.000]   But you have to decide, am I ready to turn over this information?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.360]   And so sometimes you can generalize.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.320]   For example, if you are purchasing an insurance policy and you are soliciting advice on how
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:00.080]   much life insurance to buy, then you can generalize the amount of assets that you have for the
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   life insurance advisor.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.920]   You don't need to share with them where everything is.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.120]   But at the end of the day, sometimes you're probably going to want to keep your mouth
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.840]   shut and not talk about the bucket of gold that you keep in Uncle Joe's basement or the
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.240]   valuable collection of personal artifacts.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.840]   You're just going to need to mentally tag those things yourself and compartmentalize.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.440]   Now that's the big picture in terms of the actual professional.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.640]   I do think that you can do a better job of working with your actual service providers
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.320]   as they are now, just simply by asking and by trying.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.440]   One of the things that amazed me, and I think it's probably improved in the last few years,
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.160]   I've not been active in the business, nor have I been licensed for about four years
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.040]   now, but I think it's probably been improved in the wake of the Snowden revelations, in
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.520]   the wake of many recent high profile data breaches, such as the Equifax breach.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:53.040]   I think there's probably more of an attention being paid to the security of communications.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.400]   But when I was actively working with clients in this space, I had many clients who would
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.940]   push back against the most basic step of using encrypted email.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:07.040]   We had a very simple encryption program set up where when I sent an email that had personal
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.520]   financial information, I would always encrypt the email.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   It was very simple.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.760]   And yet, many clients did not want to use it and did not want to learn how to use it.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.280]   And if you are interested in that, just work with your provider and say, "Hey, I'd like
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.600]   to use a secure form of communication."
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.120]   Make sure that you're using an encrypted email program.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.580]   And many of the big firms have that established already.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.000]   If you're working with a small independent practitioner, just move over to one of the
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.320]   more accessible ones that are simply available.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.000]   You guys are big proponents of proton mail.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.120]   I think it's fantastic that anybody can use a proton mail setup and especially get them
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.480]   to move their business to that and try to get their clients to use that so that you're
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.720]   using an encrypted email program.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.760]   In the world of encrypted communication apps for voice and text communications, there's
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.280]   no reason not to be using a more secure communication solution.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.520]   The next thing you can do is just ask.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.040]   For example, very few people ever ask anything about how their data is being stored.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.200]   And so, many times, your financial professionals will think that people don't care about the
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.380]   fact that we all have file cabinets with all of your information right there, copies of
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.160]   your statements, copies of your mortgage, copies of your home address.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.080]   Well, nobody ever asks about that.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   So ask.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.320]   Ask what are the locks like?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.540]   Do you encrypt information?
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.080]   How do you store information?
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.320]   Make sure that your advisors are storing things digitally.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:30.920]   It's far easier to protect information digitally with a good, high-quality encryption system
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:36.680]   that's mandated by the larger firm than it is to protect file cabinets, frankly.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.040]   You can get into most file cabinets with a bobby pin.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:45.480]   So just by asking, that will start to raise it to the awareness of your providers.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.180]   Also, try to opt out of sharing information.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.720]   In all the years that I worked with people, I only had one person who, when filling out
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.200]   a life insurance application, asked me, "Do I have to give my Social Security number?"
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.800]   I had never known if you had to give your Social Security number or not.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.200]   I assumed you did because it was there on the form, but I didn't know.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.000]   So I went and I asked, and I found out that, no, this particular client didn't need to
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.520]   give me their Social Security number.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.000]   Now, certainly, it's convenient for the insurance agent and it's convenient for the insurance
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.540]   company to have your Social Security number.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.320]   But the problem is, number one, now that Social Security number is sitting on your advisor's
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.640]   desk on a piece of paper, that's probably going to stay in the file right on top of
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.360]   the desk overnight while the cleaning crew comes in and cleans up the office and empties
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.560]   the trash.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.120]   But also, that Social Security number is now going to be used and it's going to be tied
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   to your account.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.360]   So you're giving out information that's going to make it much easier for your information
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.120]   to go into the centralized medical information bureau database.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.320]   There's a special database that, as an example from the world of insurance, all of your medical
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.920]   information is stored in this medical bureau of information database.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.740]   It stores all of your applications for insurance.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.000]   It stores your physician's reports.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.120]   It stores all of the medical information so that it's more convenient for the life insurance
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.240]   companies to do medical underwriting on you.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.440]   And that's going to be tied to your Social Security number.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.120]   And so if you can just pull back and you can get a policy without that, then do so.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.360]   Now, not all companies will have that same policy, but at least try.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.020]   I think my observation has been we get what we deserve.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.360]   We give up all the information because we can and we don't think about it.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.160]   And it's only going to be in the day when people start saying, "You know what?
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.080]   This is abuse of me for you to get all this information.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.520]   Facebook, you're abusing me by taking this, my original content, and monetizing it.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.860]   Physician, you are abusing me by asking for all this information."
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.760]   For example, when I fill out forms, and I encourage other people, when I fill out forms
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.560]   at the doctor's office, these forms are usually made up just simply to cover every base all
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.080]   at once, and you don't have to sign everything.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.400]   So when you're filling out forms, read every line and cross every line out that you don't
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   agree to.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.280]   Or another example would be something like HIPAA notices.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:59.680]   HIPAA notices, everybody goes around and automatically signs the HIPAA disclosure forms thinking
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.560]   that what they're signing is actually something that says that they're protecting my personal
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.040]   health information by my signing this HIPAA form.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.800]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.640]   There's nothing that you're signing that says that by signing the HIPAA form, you are not
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.760]   saying that your information is going to be protected.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.600]   You have no way to protect your personal health information by signing or by not signing the
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   HIPAA form.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.120]   What the HIPAA form says, it's a disclosure that tells you that we're sharing your information
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.080]   with all of these different companies and all of these different people who have the
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.180]   opportunity to participate in it.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:41.820]   You're not legally required, neither by the letter of the law, you're not legally required
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.060]   to sign the HIPAA release.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.860]   And if you do sign the HIPAA release, and if you ever need to sue your medical provider
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   for sharing your information, then you've lost it by signing the HIPAA form.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.700]   So simple example, like don't sign the HIPAA forms.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:01.580]   And when the person at the front desk that doesn't have any clue how to do it or what
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.580]   it says, says, "Yes, you have to."
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.580]   "No, I don't.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   It is not the law."
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:12.020]   And I think that the majority of this information, it goes out because people don't know.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.020]   Nobody knows.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.620]   When I used to open investment accounts, the average investment account paperwork system
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.020]   is about 200 to 300 pages.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.660]   Do you think anybody in their right mind is going to sit there and read 200 to 300 pages?
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.660]   Of course not.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.260]   It's just all by the big lawyers who write every single thing in there.
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:31.000]   And you have to go at a certain point with good faith and say, "Well, my advisor is going
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.540]   to tell me if there's anything bad in here."
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.180]   I always tried to point out, for example, the arbitration clauses and the important
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.660]   points in the paperwork.
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.840]   But nobody reads it.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   Nobody does it.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.820]   And until we start paying attention and sitting there and saying, "If I'm going to sign this,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.100]   I'm going to sit here in your office and I'm going to read it."
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.620]   I've done that when I signed a mortgage one time.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.180]   I told the mortgage provider, I said, "You better send the paperwork over in advance
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.980]   because I'm not just going to sign, sign, sign, sign, sign until I've read it.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.300]   And if you don't and they didn't, well, we're going to sit here in your office and you can
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.880]   sit here right with us and watch me read every single line until we start cleaning this mess
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.820]   up and actually having legal documents that make sense and actually protect the information
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.940]   of the people involved."
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.460]   But until then, just say no and stop participating.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.100]   And what I find, I cross out all the lines on the doctor forms and whatnot.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.740]   They look at it and they say, "But you have to."
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.500]   I say, "No, I don't agree to that."
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:28.700]   That doesn't mean just because I don't agree to these egregious overbearing legalese doesn't
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.940]   mean you can't treat me today.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.220]   You can treat me and I'm not going to agree to this form.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.380]   That's some interesting information, man.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.380]   I didn't know that about the HIPAA.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.660]   Definitely going to have to question that more so going forward.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.660]   And I agree with you.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.660]   Everything's written nowadays.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:46.980]   I mean, it's kind of like the terms of service anytime you want to open a new account or
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.540]   anything else nowadays, the new millennium.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.340]   Everybody just agrees, "Yes, I have read and understand the terms of service," and just
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   kind of move on.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:59.620]   And if there's a blank for it, we fill it in and we just say, "Okay."
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.860]   So I like that fact that start questioning and give pushback and compartmentalize out
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.860]   of all that.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:11.060]   Just kind of continue with the privacy aspect of things.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:15.740]   One of the things that we talk about as far as the financial side of the side of privacy
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:22.980]   is telling people to utilize trusts, LLCs, and other legal vehicles for privacy.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:28.500]   As a financial advisor, in your opinion, which is better for privacy and which is better
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.900]   financially for the person itself?
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.500]   And are the two at odds or can they actually work together?
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.900]   Probably if I were going to identify one area where there's more mystique around it, I would
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:46.180]   have to identify this area of entities, the idea of a trust or an entity, an LLC or a
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.260]   corporation, et cetera.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:53.860]   There's a lot of, I would call it mystique around it where people think that, the phrase
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.220]   often, "Well, I'm using an LLC for the tax benefits," or "You need to use an LLC for
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.020]   the tax benefits," et cetera.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.620]   And I try to push back really hard about this.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.140]   I've done a bunch of shows on the taxation of business entities, et cetera, to try to
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.380]   help people understand you don't need to be intimidated by these terms.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.900]   There are no fundamental tax benefits for an LLC because, as an example, an LLC can
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.700]   choose to be taxed as a personal entity, as an S corporation or as a C corporation, and
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.180]   you just file your election with the IRS.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:28.340]   There's nothing magical about an LLC versus another type of corporate entity.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.340]   It's a big question.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:37.620]   And so, my answer to it would be more in terms of structure rather than specifically.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.180]   When you get into the world of entities, and let's just call it an entity because an entity
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:48.460]   includes any kind of trust or corporation or other business structure, they all have
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.120]   certain features.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:56.500]   And an entity will be written to take advantage of certain features based upon the way that
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.240]   it's structured, based upon the way that it works.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:05.620]   There are certain things that you can do using an LLC to hold a business, business shares,
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:10.980]   for example, that you can't do with an S corporation or with a C corporation.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.300]   There are certain things, however, that you can't do vice versa.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.260]   And so, the most important thing to all of these is to look and say, "What am I actually
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.040]   trying to do?
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.340]   What am I actually trying to accomplish?"
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.440]   And then, there's no way around it.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.180]   You either have to do a huge amount of research or you need to speak with a knowledgeable
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.540]   expert in this particular area to figure out what's the appropriate way for me to set it
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.540]   up.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:38.280]   With taxes, there are a lot of misunderstandings with regard to taxes because you can have
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:46.300]   a trust or a corporation and that can either affect the taxation or it can not affect the
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.300]   taxation.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.620]   And in certain circumstances, you may want to affect the taxation or you may want to
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.340]   not affect the taxation.
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.360]   The big principle with regard to business entities is you'll either have what's called
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   flow-through taxation.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.120]   This can be the same for a business or for a trust.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.240]   You'll either have a flow-through taxation where the income shows up on your personal
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.780]   tax return or you can have taxation that occurs at the entity level where the income doesn't
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:17.840]   show up on your personal tax return but it shows up on the individual entity's return.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.320]   That doesn't have anything to do with privacy.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.020]   It doesn't affect it one way or the other.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.960]   It has more to do with the particular tax strategy that you're trying to pursue.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.700]   Sometimes you really don't want to have taxation at the entity level.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.880]   For example, trust tax rates are very, very high.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   They automatically go – if you're being taxed on assets that are held in the trust
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.040]   and the trust itself is being taxed, you basically automatically go with very low amounts of
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.380]   income to the highest marginal tax bracket in the personal tax code.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.840]   So sometimes that's a very bad thing and it would be much cheaper for you to pay those
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.240]   assets personally, to pay those taxes personally.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.920]   But there are times where you gain other benefits from that.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.280]   For example, maybe by moving the asset into a trust, you've removed it from the personal
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.280]   ownership of the individual and that's helpful for estate tax planning or it's helpful from
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.920]   asset protection planning or it's helpful for some other reason and you want to go ahead
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.720]   and pay that higher rate.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.040]   So it's not either/or.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.800]   The key is to look and understand that there's going to be a tradeoff and a balance between
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:25.320]   taxation, privacy, control over the assets or control over the business and even the
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.600]   distribution of the assets.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:33.720]   And once you get clear on what you want to do, then you can decide on the appropriate
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   structure.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:40.600]   I would here emphasize however that for most people, it's fine to keep it simple.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:48.840]   As an example, the best, simplest form of asset protection planning for most people
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:55.000]   is to use what are called qualified accounts such as your 401(k) or 403(b) or IRA to use
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.560]   a qualified account to hold significant assets and then to use the homestead laws in your
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   state for your real estate.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.360]   So two examples for me being in Florida.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:13.920]   If I have a million dollars in an IRA and I own a million dollar home, free and clear
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:21.960]   of any mortgage, then I now have essentially ironclad asset protection for my IRA and for
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960]   my home.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.480]   So you can sue me, I can lose the lawsuit, but money that's in an IRA or a 401(k) is
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.560]   not available to the claims of creditors.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.760]   And it's basically ironclad.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.000]   It's as close to ironclad as you can get.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.360]   And that's cheap.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.960]   And also my home, if I own the home, then that's also ironclad.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.020]   In the state of Florida, we have an unlimited homestead exemption.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:46.320]   So you could have a $20 million personal residence that you're homesteading and you can be sued
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.080]   and nobody can take that $20 million residence away from you.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:55.280]   Now, the problem is that both of those things are very un-private.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.120]   The qualified account is very un-private, specifically to the government authorities.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:07.760]   And the house is very un-private because it's going to be listed in my name in the local
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.880]   tax database.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:16.400]   And so every stage that I move to get to privacy, if I take money out of the IRA and I put it
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:26.240]   into a safe at home, now I've got more privacy, but I'm giving up that guaranteed asset protection.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.680]   Or if I move my house into a trust, depending on how I structure that, I may or may not
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.900]   give up that homestead protection.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.560]   So it's important to look at each one and recognize there's probably going to be a trade-off
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.320]   between these taxes, privacy, control, distribution.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.840]   And let me look at my specific situation and be practical about it while also getting good
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.120]   advice on how to actually structure it.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   That's my general answer.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.960]   If you want to ask any specific questions, I can try to do better and home in on a specific
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.480]   asset or asset type, but that's a general answer to the question.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:04.160]   No, I think we could—I think we can probably work with that.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.520]   Thank you for such a detailed answer on that.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:17.200]   So one thing I'm personally very interested in is actually building wealth and actually
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.000]   moving up your various stages there.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.800]   So how do you prioritize where to put money?
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:30.720]   And with the understanding that this is balanced with actually living life, but that $100,000
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.160]   you talk about, obviously a savings account maybe wouldn't be the best place to have
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.400]   $100,000 parked.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:44.960]   What's your recommendation as far as cash on hand, money in a savings account, certificates
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.800]   of deposits or a CD ladder or stock market real estate, gold and silver?
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   What say you?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:58.160]   So I have a—shockingly enough, I have an episode of Radical Personal Finance, number
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.960]   481, called Where Should I Keep My Emergency Fund, where I walk through that in a detailed
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.480]   format over the course of about an hour.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   So you'll want to link to that in the show notes, episode 481, Where Should I Keep My
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.840]   Emergency Fund?
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:13.520]   But the short answer to it is going to be it's always a matter of tradeoffs.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.760]   And those tradeoffs are fine, but it's important to recognize that you have to look at this
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   individually.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.440]   So let's walk through this with an extra focus on privacy, but recognize that privacy
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.920]   is not the only thing.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.920]   Now, with regard to saving—having $100,000 in a savings account in your bank, that is
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.680]   actually a fine plan because, assuming that's an FDIC-insured account, it doesn't get much
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.440]   safer than that.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   About the only risk that you would be exposed to from the perspective of safety of your
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:49.400]   money with having $100,000 in your savings account is inflation.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.600]   And generally, we're not going to worry about that on a short-term basis.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.280]   So it's really secure.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.200]   The FDIC insurance is really important and really valuable.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.880]   The bank is going to protect that money.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.040]   That's not so much money where you're likely to be targeted.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.880]   So that is going to be very secure.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   But you're not going to have a lot of accessibility to it.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.160]   If you need to go and get money out, it's going to start to be recorded transactions.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.080]   You start taking out $20,000 of cash.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.820]   Now we're going to have currency transaction reports, et cetera.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:21.080]   So it's not going to be very private, and it's not very accessible.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.280]   So let's just walk through each of them.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   And I'll encourage you that every one of these actually has ways that you can use it.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.480]   And I think they all have their place.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.160]   So with regard to cash, I think most people should keep-- and by cash here, I mean physical
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.640]   currency-- I think many people should keep physical currency available to them much more
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   than they do.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.880]   We've got a disease, the disease of the plastic, where most of us are accustomed to just swiping
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.200]   for everything.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.580]   And I'd like to see that reversed, because if we don't use cash, we may lose the ability
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.400]   to lose cash.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:58.600]   The so-called war on cash, I think, is often overblown, but it is real.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.440]   And I don't want to lose the ability to use cash.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.880]   And so I encourage people, whenever possible, just spend with currency.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.720]   I want to encourage the cash economy so that we can always maintain the anonymity and the
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.120]   privacy of cash transactions.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.960]   You can store a huge amount of cash very privately.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.920]   $100,000 in $100 bills, I mean, you vacuum wrap it.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.280]   I think that'd take, what, probably four inches.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.680]   A four-inch stack of $100 bills would be $100,000.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.000]   So that would be very easy to conceal.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.560]   That would be very easy to store safely.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.600]   And that could be very doable for many people who want to keep cash.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.080]   And I encourage people, especially when I've done consultations with people who are in
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:45.440]   extreme adverse negotiations with creditors, people who are very behind on their bills
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.940]   and they're working to catch up.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:50.040]   When you're in that situation, you basically have to take extreme measures.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:56.080]   And one of those extreme measures is you lose your ability to really participate in the
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.840]   bank account world because your creditors, if they are able to gain a judgment against
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.240]   you, put themselves in a situation where they may be able to clear out your account.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.640]   And so I've often encouraged people who are in contentious, antagonistic relationships
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.040]   to say, "You've got to protect yourself because you want to talk about heartbreaking.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.120]   It's really heartbreaking to be working with a young family who has $5,000 to their name
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.040]   and they keep it all in their bank account.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:24.640]   And then the credit card company goes in and wipes out the $5,000 to settle an old balance.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.400]   And now they start balancing their mortgage.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.080]   They're pushed out on the street because they don't have the money, et cetera.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.560]   So you've got to be strong about it.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.800]   So cash is very, very helpful and very, very valuable.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.240]   You do face problems with cash.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.380]   How do you keep it secure?
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.200]   And how do you keep it secure in a way that it's not going to be stolen, that someone's
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.680]   not going to know about it, et cetera?
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:45.360]   But it has a really good possibility for you.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.400]   When you get to the world of bank accounts, savings accounts, et cetera, you get a huge
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.680]   amount of security and you can get some privacy depending on how you do it.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.400]   So number one, most of the time with a bank, you're going to be protected by the privacy
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:04.160]   laws of that bank or the state that's governing that, but that bank.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.480]   And for most things, that's pretty private.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.760]   In general, in the United States, if you know I have a bank account at, make it up, Bank
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:17.340]   of America, you can't really call Bank of America, especially you can't like you used
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:22.640]   to be able to, to call Bank of America and social engineer your way in to finding out
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.080]   the information on my account.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.920]   It used to be easier to do that.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.000]   It seems to be a little bit harder now, I think, in my opinion.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.360]   But there are risks to this, and these risks are more widely known around the world versus
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:34.640]   just in the United States.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:40.480]   I recently, a few months ago, had somebody in my life who traveled to Mexico and heard
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.000]   firsthand from some people who were living in one of the very difficult areas of Mexico.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.440]   And one of the tools that the local drug cartel used is they had people on the inside of the
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.360]   local Mexican bank, and they would use this inside information for somebody who worked
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.880]   for the bank, who would then of course have access to the bank's computer systems, to
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.160]   find out how much some of the wealthy people in the town had in their bank accounts.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.840]   And if they knew that somebody had $50,000 in their bank accounts, then the cartel would
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:11.200]   take that information, they would go and kidnap the person's child, and the ransom demand,
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.120]   they would line it up with how much money was in the bank account.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.040]   So they would require a $50,000 ransom, knowing that there was a much stronger chance that
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.840]   person was just going to go ahead and pay the ransom, because they could, without involving
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:27.240]   the police, without involving other people, and they would pay it quickly to get their
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.760]   child back.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.920]   That's a really rough situation.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.640]   And if I lived in Mexico, there's not a chance in the world I would be keeping money in a
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.920]   savings account like that.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.720]   Now I think there are strategies for privacy that you can use with savings accounts.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.320]   Number one would be diversification and compartmentalization.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.960]   There's no reason not to have four accounts at four different banks.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.440]   I think it would be valuable to have accounts at banks that are slightly less prominent.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.560]   If you have, for example, a company like Bank of America, there are going to be thousands
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.840]   of people who may have access to your, to be able to look up the customer account records
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.200]   and find out who has such an account here.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.640]   I don't know what their internal controls are on that, but most big companies will have
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.320]   thousands of people who would have access to that information.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.160]   If you banked with a local credit union, on the other hand, there may only be a handful
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.960]   of people who would have access to that information.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.560]   Now your profile is going to be bigger at your local credit union than it would be with
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.560]   Bank of America.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.320]   And this is where we get into the world of trade-offs.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.520]   If I'm at the local credit union, everyone knows I have a million dollars in my account.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.120]   Well, I'm the local millionaire.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.540]   Whereas a Bank of America, I may just still be a number on a screen.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.640]   So I think that it's valuable to consider diversifying your bank holdings using some
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:37.200]   larger national banks, but also there's benefit to local, regional banks and credit unions
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.080]   that are more likely to be a little bit more private.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.360]   And then I think international banking comes into play here as well.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.240]   That it's relatively easy, although it's harder for US citizens than it once was, it's relatively
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.680]   easy to establish internationally held bank accounts.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:57.040]   For US Americans, the simplest and easiest access to the banking system that would be
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.680]   abroad would be Canada.
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.240]   Very easy to establish Canadian bank accounts, and I've encouraged lots of consulting clients
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.440]   to do that.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.560]   I wouldn't be very confident about banking in Mexico, but there are other low-hanging
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.440]   fruit that you can start to establish banking relationships abroad.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.080]   When it comes to something like precious metals, again, you get into a world of trade-offs.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:22.120]   The great benefit of precious metals is you can store a huge amount of value in a very
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.680]   small space.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:29.200]   And that huge amount of value can be stored in a very small space that is completely private.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.960]   Nobody knows how much money you have in your private secure storage when it's held there
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.280]   in the form of physical currency.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.480]   It can't be hacked.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.500]   It can't be opened up.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.120]   It's going to be very, very private.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.780]   Now, of course, there are disadvantages with the value of the metal.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.780]   May go up, may go down.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.480]   You may be dealing with a volatile market, but it's very, very helpful and you can store
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.680]   that for a long period of time.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.400]   The trick when it comes to buying and selling precious metals privately is to approach it
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   in the right way.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   And there are two different phases.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.480]   You have to think about the buy and you have to think about the sell.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.880]   So and we have to think about the amount of money.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.920]   It's one thing if you want to buy $1,000 worth of silver bullion.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.040]   It's another thing if you want to buy a million dollars worth of-- there would be no way to
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.320]   store a million of silver bullion-- a million dollars worth of gold bullion.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.160]   So the first thing is you can still-- if you want to get very private, there is almost
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.520]   nothing that is as good as precious metals.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.400]   You can buy with cash.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.220]   And you can buy precious metals with cash.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.360]   You can walk into a coin store or a coin dealer and you can plop down $100 bills and you can
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   buy with cash.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.160]   Now, the first thing you want to be careful of is the-- it's about a $10,000 reporting
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.120]   rule that the coin dealer will be subject to.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.880]   That if you do a transaction that is higher-- any kind of cash transaction that's higher
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.840]   than $10,000, in general, the person that you're going to be working with is going to
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:54.280]   be required to file a form with the US federal government indicating that you have engaged
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.720]   in a large cash transaction report.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.860]   And that's the same at your bank.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:04.040]   If you go and deposit large amounts of cash, that's the same at a coin dealer as well.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.520]   So if you could go in and buy $100,000 worth of, let's say, gold American eagles from your
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.760]   local coin dealer, and you could pay cash, but they would be required to report that
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.520]   transaction if you did it with over $10,000.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.600]   So your two solutions to this of buying things privately so that there's not a reported transaction
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:28.000]   is number one, keep your amounts significantly lower than that $10,000 number and make sure
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.080]   that you're careful of structuring.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.120]   You don't want to go in and in the morning make an $8,000 transaction and in the afternoon
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.800]   an $8,000 transaction.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.920]   The coin dealer would be required to report that as a structured cash transaction exceeding
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.200]   $10,000.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:47.100]   So either do it small, once a week, go and make a $5,000 transaction, and pretty quickly
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:52.160]   you can set some serious money aside, or use a bank wire or a bank check.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.720]   And if you use a bank wire or a bank check, now you have the ability to make a transaction,
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.880]   a private transaction, to purchase precious metals in a way that is not reported to the
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.280]   tax authorities.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.840]   However, of course, now that you've involved a bank wire or a bank check, there will, of
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.520]   course, be a record in your bank account.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.800]   So that's when you are buying.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:22.240]   Skipping to the sell, when you get into the world of selling gold and silver, then you've
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.360]   got to be clear on what you're selling and understand what the rules are, whether it's
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.400]   able to be private or non-private.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.420]   So let's say that you have $100,000 of precious metals and you go into your local coin dealer
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.160]   and you want to be able to sell that to them privately.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:46.800]   Well, you've got to read the rules about which types of assets are going to be your best
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.140]   to go with.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.400]   Your American Eagle coins are exempted.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.400]   They're totally private.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.200]   You can sell any quantity of American Eagle coins without that being a reported transaction.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.760]   No matter what amount, as long as you're dealing with a one ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce,
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.520]   or 10th ounce American Eagle, those are not reportable to the IRS when you sell them.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.120]   That's really, really helpful to know.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.320]   Also, you can do that with American Gold Buffalos and Gold Austrian Philharmonics are very valuable
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.400]   coins that you can sell any amount of without there being a transaction.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.120]   So those are your most private ones.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.280]   With American Silver Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, and Austrian Philharmonics are your
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.360]   private silver coins.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.880]   Now on the flip side, some of your other forms of gold coins have to be reported depending
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.560]   on the certain amounts.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:40.160]   So Canadian Maple Leafs, South African Krugerrands, Mexican Onzas, those are gold bullion coins
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.020]   that if you sell more than 25 of them, that will be a reportable event which will be reported
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.240]   to the IRS on a 1099.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.440]   And then when you move into the world of bullion bars, if you're selling bullion bars that
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.800]   are greater than a kilo, you're going to have a reportable transaction.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.440]   Same thing with silver rounds, et cetera.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.700]   So that was probably way too detailed.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:08.840]   But every single aspect of precious metals has certain benefits and certain disadvantages.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   And you want to look at that and understand how does this help.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.720]   And especially you have to be careful with the volatility of precious metals.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   To wrap up, a couple other categories, stocks and things like that, your ability to hold
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.520]   them and own them will depend on the ownership.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.720]   And most of the time, you're going to have a relationship with a broker who's going to
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.620]   help you with the ownership of that.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.760]   And that may or may not be private.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.800]   Real estate can be purchased privately, depending on how you're approaching it.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.480]   There are other assets as well, though.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.200]   For example, insurance policies, cash value life insurance policies have the benefit of
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.840]   being outside of the banking system.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.560]   And so in that way, they're a little bit more private.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.480]   And generally, most of the transactions, as long as the policy stays in force, most of
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.060]   the transactions with a life insurance policy are not generally reported to the IRS.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.920]   So the key is to lay out what am I concerned about?
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.600]   Am I concerned about the IRS?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.840]   Am I concerned about a creditor?
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.600]   Am I concerned about an ex-wife?
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.080]   Am I concerned about a political enemy?
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.720]   And then to develop a strategy that's appropriate.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.240]   I think it's important to emphasize that there are different scales to these things.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.600]   If somebody has $10,000 of value, there's no reason to do anything other than to keep
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.720]   money in a local bank account and to keep some amount of currency on hand.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.920]   That would be crazy to get into the world of saying, I'm going to go and buy Gold Eagles
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.240]   because I can buy them and hold them privately.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.040]   Somebody has a few million dollars, and you're trying to shelter and set aside a couple million
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.680]   bucks privately, you're not going to go down to your local coin dealer and deal in the
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.880]   world of millions of dollars.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.960]   You're going to go and open up a bullion storage account with an international bullion storage
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   company.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.160]   And so you've got to be clear on where am I, and then get the advice that's appropriate
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.720]   to your specific financial life stage.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.880]   I think Jesse and I had the exact same thought at the exact same moment when you were talking
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.520]   about looking at who you're trying to hide this from.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.000]   And this is basically threat modeling for your finances, deciding if you want to be
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.440]   private from the IRS or the bank or whom.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   I appreciate the depth you went into on precious metal, because that's something I've not actually
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.480]   dipped my toe into yet, but that's probably the next thing that I'm considering investing
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.200]   in completely off the privacy stuff.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.160]   How wise an investment is that?
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.720]   I think it depends on the approach.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.640]   There are a couple of major problems with the world of precious metals.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.080]   Number one, you're dealing with a very volatile market, especially the silver market.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.000]   The silver market is extremely volatile, and the gold market as well.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.420]   Number two, you're dealing with basically a pure commodity whose value is measured only
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.280]   by supply and demand, and that's really hard.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:56.200]   In many ways, if you said, Joshua, would you rather have a $100,000 house or $100,000 of
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.840]   gold, I'd rather have the house, because the house has the ability to earn income.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:06.560]   Gold, silver don't have the ability to earn income, and so they have a real disadvantage
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.900]   when it comes to that.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.800]   If you were to total the whole amount of gold that's available in the world and put it into
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.640]   a small geographic area, it would be a very, very small amount.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.880]   So in terms of true wealth, it's hard to use as true wealth.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.000]   That said, gold and silver have a bunch of major advantages.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.260]   It's possible, especially in times of financial insecurity, it's possible that their values
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:40.920]   may increase, and it's possible that their values could increase substantially.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.480]   Depending on who you're talking to, you'll find all kinds of gold bugs and silver bulls
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.800]   who will talk about the fact that all the silver is being used up in electronics, and
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.120]   so therefore silver is going to massively adjust, or the value of silver is at an all-time
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.800]   low in terms of the gold-silver ratio, and that has to adjust.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.760]   And so many people believe there's a big upside in silver.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.520]   Personally, I'm not convinced, but many people believe that, and they make good arguments
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520]   for that.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:13.360]   With regard to gold, similarly, gold has certain benefits that could work out in terms of growth
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.000]   in the investment market.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.360]   The things that concern me about gold is that it's not an asset.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.800]   It has a huge value because gold is what central banks own.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.400]   Central banks own and stockpile gold, as well as Chinese and Indian people who have a culture
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.000]   that's devoted to gold.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.380]   In the U.S. American market, I find it hard to see the value of gold.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.820]   Very few people have ever held a gold coin.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.920]   Very few people know the value of it.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.280]   So what I look at gold and silver is it should probably be a relatively small percentage
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]   of your net worth.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.040]   It's very reasonable to say, "I'm going to keep five or, I don't know, five to 10% of
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:54.720]   my assets in," I would generally encourage the majority gold, in gold and silver.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.080]   And it is a useful insurance policy.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.440]   Many technically created investment accounts will allocate a small percentage, usually
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.880]   about 5%, to commodities, especially precious metals.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.240]   And I think the other benefits of gold are for the worst case scenario, the disaster
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   scenario.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.600]   I think a lot about the portability of money because I have both seen historically and
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.440]   also in current day how bad it is if all of your money is locked up in one place and you
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.720]   can't get it out when you need it.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.960]   So if you go back and you think about what was it like if you were a Jew in 1930 in Germany,
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.080]   there was plenty of time to get out.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.820]   But there was only time to get out if you could get out quickly.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.360]   And so the people who had gold and silver and jewels to get out, that was really, really
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   valuable.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.640]   In the modern world, it's a whole lot harder to see how – it's a whole lot harder to
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:55.320]   walk down to your local airport and plunk down a one-ounce gold eagle and pay for your
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.800]   airplane ticket out.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.240]   But I tell you what, still to this day, if any country in the world, if I needed to get
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.520]   out, I would always want to make sure that I had some gold coins handy to get me out.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.920]   I'd always want to make sure that I had some that were in another place.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.440]   I think the big reasons to pursue gold is the portability.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.040]   The fact that it is the most universal – well, other than the US dollar, it's one of the
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.320]   most universal assets.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.800]   You can walk into any coin shop, any pawn shop, any jewelry shop, anywhere in the world,
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.260]   no matter what the official sanctions are and the buying and selling of gold and silver,
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.800]   you can plunk down a gold coin and you can get a good quantity of the local currency.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.600]   I think that's a real value.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.920]   And you can do it in a very compact form of wealth.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.840]   And it allows you to have money that should maintain its purchasing power over time that's
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.160]   held privately.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.640]   So you think about what it would be like to hold certain assets like gold coins or silver
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.160]   coins that are securely vaulted, securely stored and privately owned.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.760]   You can own those for decades and nobody would have any idea.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.480]   That's a real value that you don't get with other assets.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.600]   So I hope that that lays out the positive case.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.400]   I think there are a lot of reasons for it.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.800]   But I think it's best to look at gold as insurance and as kind of worst case scenario stuff and
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:14.280]   to focus on cash and other investment activities for real growth.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.360]   Because at the end of the day, the value of gold and silver is only determined by what
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.680]   someone's willing to pay for you.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.160]   It's an unproductive asset.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.200]   Well, Josh, when you were talking earlier and you keep talking about cash and I love
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:32.120]   it, I agree with you in the fact that we have a plastic-- I forget what you call it-- but
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.960]   an issue with people utilizing plastic too much.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.480]   And we need to go back on the cash.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.040]   I tell you when you fill out a home loan mortgage and you got to give them the last two, three
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.040]   months of your bank statements, it's definitely a huge pattern of life that banks are holding
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.280]   on to about us, not just our money, but also a pattern of life where you spend your money.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.480]   All this talk about coins kind of puts you on the spot, kind of a different question
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.400]   that probably a lot of financial advisors don't get.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   But what are your thoughts on the current talk around the fireplaces and stuff like
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   that about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:08.000]   Wow, is there a more contentious topic as we record this?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.520]   Bitcoin made the news for making $10,000.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:19.180]   I am very optimistic with the future of cryptocurrencies.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:25.040]   If you think about the best case scenario, the way that some people describe cryptocurrencies
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.640]   as cash for the internet, that is really exciting to me because I am very concerned about the
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.840]   loss of privacy of everything being digital transactions.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:44.440]   And it would be wonderful to have increasing amounts of privacy available for digital exchanges.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.240]   So I am very optimistic about that.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:55.560]   I am concerned about Bitcoin, although I am hoping that it continues to work out.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.200]   The founders of Bitcoin, or like the original people, and they talked about the way that
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.440]   the inflation would go and then the steadying out.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.840]   We will see if that happens.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.600]   But the problem is that as long as any of these currencies are being hoarded for their
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:17.400]   future increase in value, it diminishes their ability to be used as a stable source of exchange.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.560]   And that is a real problem with Bitcoin as I see it right now.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.960]   There are a lot of people who are buying Bitcoin, but there are not a lot of people who are
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.680]   doing a lot of transactions on Bitcoin.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.480]   Now, I also see the marketplace developing.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   There have been a whole bunch of changes specifically to Bitcoin where there are more people accepting
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   Bitcoin locally.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.960]   There are more people doing things on a local basis so you can actually spend it.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.320]   But it is kind of like the same problem of buying and selling gold and silver coins.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.760]   You can do some really cool stuff with gold and silver coins.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.320]   For example, you want to have a private financial transaction with somebody with a significant
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.360]   amount of money exchanging hands.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.560]   In some ways, it is hard to get better than using a gold or silver coin or a variety of
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.160]   them as appropriate to the monetary unit.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.520]   The problem is what do you do with it then?
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.840]   Somebody pays you in silver bullion coins, silver rounds for your services that you have
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   provided.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.920]   What do you actually physically do with it?
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.960]   Where do you go and spend it?
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.720]   It is harder to do that.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.440]   And you are dealing with a very small subset of the population that would even know the
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.640]   value of a silver round or even know the value of an American Eagle and be willing to incorporate
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.120]   that in their transaction.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.000]   I think the same problem applies to Bitcoin as things stand right now.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.680]   So I do not know which currencies will turn out to be the currencies of the future.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.200]   I do think we have a huge opportunity going forward.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:48.820]   And then finally, I guess from a privacy perspective, the other concern is that with the exception
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.200]   of some that are focused on privacy, you actually have in some ways, you have the opposite of
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.040]   privacy where every transaction is recorded in the blockchain.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.480]   And so it is all a matter of can I get in privately and out privately?
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.940]   Because anytime that money transfers out of the crypto world into your bank account or
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:11.160]   into some other scenario, you lose the same privacy that you had internally.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.360]   So all that say, I am very optimistic.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:19.080]   I am excited about the future and I want to do everything I can to encourage the proliferation
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.400]   of currencies.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.960]   From a practical perspective, this would be a political philosophy and an economic philosophy.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.520]   I would like to see every single state government out of the money business.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.260]   And I would like to see money be a competitive environment where individuals choose what
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.880]   to accept for themselves.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.200]   And so that is what I see as ultimate economic freedom.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.960]   I am hopeful that we can continue to move towards that because today that system where
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.800]   somebody would say, well, how would I, if it is not a US dollar, then how should I know
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.520]   its value?
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.420]   Most people find a lot of confidence and trust in the fact that the US dollar is printed
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.240]   on a Federal Reserve note and they think it is an output of the US Federal Government.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.700]   They think it is a product of the US Federal Government because of the power of the state,
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.960]   they feel confident in it.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.060]   I would love to move to a world where people had more responsibility and they bought and
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:15.720]   sold using all kinds of currencies and let the market sort out which currency is the
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.720]   best.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.840]   That has been a total failure for the last 50 years in the world of state run and state
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   authorized currencies.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.440]   But I am hoping that in the future with the cryptocurrencies that there would be an opportunity
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.400]   to move to that competitive environment for currencies where currencies are competing
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   against each other.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   Time will tell.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.160]   Sorry to put you on the spot there with the cryptocurrencies and stuff.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:41.000]   I know it is not normally financial advisors going down that road with us, but it is an
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.720]   interesting topic right now.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.440]   I guess another thing we like to do on the CPS Podcast is kind of the elevator pitch.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.120]   I guess what is one thing that you could tell our guests or listeners right now that they
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.860]   can do to start down the road to financial freedom, just get them started?
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:03.120]   Probably the biggest thing for anybody who is interested in financial freedom will be
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.720]   to become and remain debt free.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.340]   I can give all kinds of arguments about the value of debt and those arguments are to a
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.240]   point valid, especially financially.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.280]   They can be very valid.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:22.520]   When you get down to it, if you do not owe anybody any money for any reason and if you
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:29.480]   have no payments, no guaranteed payments that you have to make on every single month that
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.520]   you have to make, that gives you a level of freedom that is truly powerful.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.960]   It gives you a level of choice that there is almost nothing you can do in your life,
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.720]   that nothing you cannot do in your life.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.120]   I worked with a guy one time who was a very wealthy bond trader, made almost half a million
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.600]   dollars a year trading bonds.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:57.120]   This person said to me, "I owe nobody any money and the benefit is if my whole business
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:03.280]   collapsed, I could work at the local grocery store as a bagger and I could earn enough
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.400]   money to support my lifestyle."
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.080]   If you get down to what the ultimate purpose of money is, it's supposed to be useful to
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.640]   us in our life.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.520]   One of the major things that money is supposed to be used for is to provide for our needs
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:21.500]   and the needs of others and also to buy a certain level of freedom and independence.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:27.540]   If you start with that freedom or make that a high priority and you become fully debt-free
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:32.140]   and you stay debt-free, your life is open to you in terms of any option you want to
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   make.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.340]   If you look back on somebody who is 70, 80, 90 years old and you were to compare somebody
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:43.280]   who got into debt and stayed out of debt and the choices, the interesting life choices
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.420]   they could make versus somebody who was deeply in debt and the constraint on them, I think
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:53.180]   you'd find someone who's much more satisfied who was out of debt.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.020]   I'll share this one story to prove my point.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:00.380]   When I was a young financial advisor, I didn't know what was going on and I would go out
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.380]   and meet with people.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.060]   I met this one person who really deeply impressed me.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.100]   It was a local business owner here in South Florida.
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:12.140]   I started in the business in 2008, which was, of course, a very difficult time to be in
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.140]   the construction business.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.180]   I probably met this guy 2009, 2010.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.300]   I don't know.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:20.460]   I sat down and we were talking money and he was sharing with me basically a little bit
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.460]   of his story.
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.340]   He said, "This isn't the first recession I've been to.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.020]   It's the third or fourth."
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.820]   He said, "So here's what I do.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.460]   Number one, I don't owe anybody any money and I never borrow money.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.460]   Number two, I keep my business lean and mean.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:38.300]   As many of my employees as possible are contractors instead of employees.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.380]   That minimizes my long-term obligation to try to pay the guys on the job, et cetera.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.740]   We keep our fixed expenses really low."
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:49.100]   This guy was working in his office, was in the back of a run-down gas station, just a
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.820]   little corner hole in the wall that he ran his business out of.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.820]   It was a big business.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:57.020]   He said, "I always keep cash on hand so I can take advantage of the opportunities."
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:03.060]   He had just recently bought a deep-sea boat, a nice big boat, from another contractor who
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.420]   had leveraged up his lifestyle during the boom time and things were falling apart.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:11.620]   He bought this $85,000 boat for about 50 grand.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:15.660]   He said, "So what I do during recessions is I go and fish every day.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.940]   I turn my recession into my mini vacation.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:19.940]   I just go and fish.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.100]   I'm enjoying this new boat.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.900]   I take my family out on it.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.840]   This is the time when I'm really pulling back.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.660]   When the construction market turns around, then I'll go ahead and get busy again.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.180]   I'll go ahead and build the business up again."
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.020]   It really impressed me because I had never thought of it that way.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:37.780]   I had always been of the idea that you got to have more, you got to do better, you got
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.300]   to have more, you got to do better, you got to fight, fight, fight for as much business
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.460]   as possible.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.460]   I had forgotten about the fact that you could just sit back and roll with the market to
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.180]   an extent.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.460]   This guy basically had for himself a sabbatical or a mini retirement when the market was down.
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.060]   Instead of spending all of his time stressed out selling stuff because he borrowed a bunch
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:59.640]   of money and trying to figure out how to keep my business going, he was out fishing every
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:04.460]   day and just had his business on the barest of minimal input.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:10.260]   It really affected me and I realized that if we all ran our lives like that, we'd be
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:16.020]   a lot closer to freedom and independence than the way that most of us run our financial
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   lives.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.020]   That's fantastic.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.620]   Joshua, thank you so much for being here.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:25.860]   This whole thing has been absolutely fantastic and I've enjoyed every second of this.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.460]   This has been full of information.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.500]   Before we close, can you tell people where they can find out more about you?
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:35.660]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com, which is a website that serves a podcast.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.540]   Since you're listening to me on a podcast, if you're interested in hearing more, there
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:41.460]   are about 600 hours of free audio available.

[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.380]   find me.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.820]   And I will second that.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:53.220]   Radical Personal Finance is one of the first podcasts in my feed that I go to.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.700]   If you're not a subscriber, head on over there.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.860]   Thank you so much for being so generous with your time.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.220]   Josh, it's been a pleasure.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.220]   I've enjoyed it.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.220]   Keep up the great work, guys.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.220]   Thank you for having me on.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.220]   Wow, man.
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.980]   That was an absolutely fantastic interview and he's answered actually quite a few questions
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:13.620]   that I've had, including some of the more tinfoil hat things like why I should own a
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.260]   few gold rounds here and there.
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.260]   I agree, man.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:19.220]   What's great about it is us sitting here taking notes.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.540]   I got a couple of pages of notes just from sitting back and listening to him.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.100]   I know we ran a little bit long.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.100]   This is going to be a huge episode for you guys, but I didn't want to cut him off if
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   you didn't.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.100]   Yeah, man.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.660]   I feel like I could have asked him a few more, but I wanted to be respectful of his time
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660]   there.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660]   So should we go ahead and jump into listener questions?
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.660]   Absolutely, man.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.900]   I'll throw you on the hook for this one real quick.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:47.180]   The one I got is, "Justin, how secure is PayPal?
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.260]   Is there anything else I should be concerned about with PayPal?"
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:51.260]   Okay, cool.
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:56.820]   Since this is a financial episode, PayPal is very secure, I believe.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:01.740]   I say that based on the fact that I don't even have a PayPal account anymore because
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.380]   I kept getting locked out of it so frequently.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:13.820]   That's a big problem if you want to take your privacy to an extreme, is you will have problems
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.820]   with PayPal.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:19.140]   If you want to access PayPal from a VPN, you're frequently going to have issues logging into
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.420]   PayPal.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:25.220]   Very secure, I believe, but it's not very private.
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.540]   PayPal shares your information with a bunch of different parties, and that's kind of a
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:34.740]   problem when we get into these online payment systems.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:43.580]   Just like privacy.com, PayPal and these online payment services have to verify your identity
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.500]   because of banking regulations.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.140]   So it's kind of a drag, man.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.140]   There's not a lot you can do.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:55.180]   I've looked at some off-the-wall ones, the privacy policies of ones like Dwala and Skrill.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:25:00.780]   I think if I had to go with one of these, probably Skrill looks the best because you
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.820]   can opt out of a lot of their data sharing.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:06.060]   It's not ideal, but they seem to have good security.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:13.820]   They seem to have put security and privacy kind of at the forefront of what they're doing
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:14.820]   there.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.860]   But man, all of these are really going to be a devil's bargain.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:23.480]   The problem with going with those off-the-wall ones like Dwala and Skrill is that not a lot
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.740]   of places accept those.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.180]   So this is kind of tough, man.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.740]   I really don't recommend PayPal at all if there's any way around it.
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.540]   Yeah, I'd say it's kind of tough, man.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.860]   When you're dealing with your own money, you obviously want there to be some of that know
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.660]   your customer and least shady kind of stuff, but you also want to protect your privacy
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:40.660]   in the same aspect.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.380]   It's kind of tough.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.220]   Yeah, it really is, man.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:50.340]   I understand why most of these services, if you get locked out, want a selfie with your
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:51.340]   ID.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.940]   They don't want just anyone to be able to take my ID and get into my stuff.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.180]   But at the same time, I don't want to send them my ID and a selfie.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:02.260]   So tough decision, man.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.620]   I guess I would say the best case would be don't use PayPal.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.780]   So anyway, moving on to the next question.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.620]   My bank does not offer two-factor authentication.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:13.620]   What best practices do you recommend for securing my account?
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:19.620]   Man, that's tough because aside from switching to another bank, there's not a whole lot of
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:27.500]   financial institutions that actually do have two-factor authentication going on twofactorauth.org.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.860]   My big things that I do to focus on mine is, one, utilizing points of contact information
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:37.340]   with my bank, whether it be my email address and a pseudo number or something like that,
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.420]   that I don't give out or give to anybody else.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:46.060]   It's solely for my banking institution and has never seen anything else.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:52.260]   The other aspect is if they allow you to use a random generated username, definitely start
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   there.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:58.700]   Making your password as tough and complicated, or your passphrase, excuse me, as tough and
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.500]   complicated as possible.
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:05.500]   And then I think another overlooked aspect of security is the security questions.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:10.660]   I think every bank or every kind of account tries to have that, and they're not checking
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.380]   up to make sure that, "Oh, you entered your mother's maiden name correctly."
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:18.300]   So to me, also randomizing that information so it can't be socially engineered or found
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.300]   anywhere else as well.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:24.460]   I think all those kind of combined give you a little bit warm and fuzzy, not as great
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:28.060]   as twofactor, but definitely add some heightened security and should actually be your normal
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.060]   practices with everything else.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060]   Absolutely.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.060]   Agree.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.100]   So unless you have anything else, I'll go ahead and close it out, man.
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.100]   This has been a long one.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.340]   Yeah, that's it, man.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.340]   All right.
